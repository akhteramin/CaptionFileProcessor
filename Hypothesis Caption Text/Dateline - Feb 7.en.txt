I'm Craig Melvin. And I'm Natalie Morales. And this is Dateline. ragedy on top of a tragedy now. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): It happened so quickly. Their parents in the backyard spa. Their mom in trouble. My dad just panicked. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): A sudden slip, a fatal fall. KEITH MORRISON: You're losing your mother. Right. KEITH MORRISON: You're watching her go right in front of you. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): Someone else was watching her too-
- a curious neighbor. LINDSAY PATTERSON: It was scary. The look on his face was almost undescribable. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): What had she seen? Was this drowning really an accident? CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): A husband and father are suddenly under suspicion. And he's crying, and we're crying. He said, they think I hurt mom. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): Three daughters stand by their dad. And one prosecutor stands firm. He's holding his wife of almost three decades under the water. And my job is to get justice for Cristi Hall. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): Was it murder? [theme music] Hello, and welcome to Dateline. A young woman peers into her neighbor's yard and sees something for a few mysterious seconds-
- a man, a woman, and a moment that's unsettling. What she saw and what she did would set in motion a chain of events that would divide a family and a jury. Here's Keith Morrison. We know the truth and we know everything that happened. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): How do we know what we know? It's emotionally unsatisfying not to have that answer. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So it is, even if we've seen something or if we think. we have. And that's the question at the heart of the whole puzzle. Is this woman right? LINDSAY PATTERSON: I know what I saw. And I know the conclusion of my story. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Of course she does. Of course she does. So why does this other woman think this? She didn't know for sure what she saw. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The question, we say, on which all the rest will turn. Why don't we begin here? Calla Mesa, California, Riverside County. Historic missions, sprawling suburbs creeping out to the rim of mountains around the eastern flank of Los Angeles. Here is where Chris and Cristi Hall had come to live out their golden years, though they were far from old when it happened. Just experienced with life and each other. As far back as I can remember, it's always been Chris and Cristi. They were never thought of as separate. They're-
- they're a unit. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): These are the three daughters, Courtney, Briana, and Ashtin. And all of them, of course, have heard scores of times the story of how their parents met. It was 1978. Cristi had gone to see a relative at the Air Force base in nearby San Bernardino and, quite by chance, while she was there, encountered a security guard who-
- to her, at least-
- looked just like Elvis. It was Blair Christopher Hall-
- Chris to his friends. Apparently, she was a little flirty at the gate. [chuckling] KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): In short order, Chris and Cristi got married. She was 17. He, 20. And as the girls grew up, they said they never doubted for a single moment the powerful bond of love-
- their parents with them and with each other. I'd venture to say we were probably closer with our parents than most children. They were the parents that I hoped to one day be. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Cristi, the vivacious glue of the family. Chris, her perfect mirror. ASHTIN HALL: My dad's a little more kick back, relax, and quiet. But they were a perfect balance, I think. Yes. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): For years, Chris Hall was a police officer in San Bernardino, until he was shot in the line of duty. And then he went off to become police chief in two small towns in Idaho. Then, in 2005, anticipating an empty nest and eventual retirement, the Halls bought this place back in Calla Mesa, which they loved for its backyard pool and spa. And life in the spring of 2007 seemed to have hit a sweet spot, as Ashtin and Briana remember their mother telling them. BRIANA HALL: We happened to be laying on the bed with her. She just started talking. She was like, I am just-
- I'm so happy that I have you girls and dad. It was kind of one of those conversations that you-
- BRIANA HALL: It was kind of rare. --that you don't have every day. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Still, there was work to be done. It was not a new house; could use some remodeling, particularly the bathroom. Courtney was still living with her parents as the work began. --that they were going to be doing the-
- KEITH MORRISON: Right. --tilework and stuff. So we wouldn't have a shower for that day. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So, shower out of commission, they decided to wake up early, put on their bathing suits, and rinse off in the outdoor spa before the contractor arrived at 6:45 AM. It was June 7, 2007. Chris got up first, turned on the spa to warm it up, and then called Briana at her college dorm in San Diego. Here's your wake-up call, babe. Get out and go on that run. KEITH MORRISON: Back at the house, Courtney dozed through her first wake-up, while Chris and Cristi made their way outside to the spa. Just after 6:30, Chris looked in on Courtney again, second call, then headed back to the spa. Life's last normal moments. 6:37 AM. I got up out of bed. And I was putting on my robe, and I just heard this panicked-
- just panicked scream from my dad yelling for me. You know, I ran down the hallway to the back porch. And I saw him-
- [sighs] --just trying to pull up my mom out of the spa. FEMALE OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Fire Department and Emergency. COURTNEY HALL (ON PHONE): [inaudible] an ambulance. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): It was she who dialed 911 as she and her father struggled to lift her mother out of the spot. It was the first moments of the worst day of our lives. Is it possible for people to understand what it's like to be in that situation? I don't think so. It's-
- to see just both your parents in the worst times that you've ever seen them. Obviously, my mom unconscious, and my dad just panicked. And for the first time in my life, seeing him just that way, not knowing what to do. Because he was a cop, he was used to dealing with those kinds of things. He was a cop. He's used to dealing with those kinds of things with people that were not his wife. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So Courtney took charge. After calling 911, she started CPR on her mother with her father. EMT and firefighter Eric Norwood was the first to respond. He just started-
- help my wife. Oh my god, help my wife. Help my wife. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Chris Hall was kneeling at his wife's side, more in the way than anything, and so hysterical it was hard for the EMTs to help. ERIC NORWOOD (VOICEOVER): It took us a little bit to get him out of the way. He didn't want to leave her. He was just holding her hand, yelling her name. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The paramedics worked on Cristi for more than 20 minutes. No vital signs. None. And-
- and no words to describe just the-
- the fear and the anxiety. You're losing your mother. Right. And you're watching her go right in front of you. We tried to save her together and we just couldn't. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The ambulance rushed her off to the hospital, where she was declared dead. She had drowned in the family spa. A private family tragedy, except maybe not so private after all. Someone was watching. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): Dateline returns after the break. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): On the morning of June 7, 2007, Briana Hall was on the road from San Diego, driving home from college. To what, she didn't know, except that her elder sister, Courtney, had called and it sounded bad. She said there was an accident. You need to just, you know, come home right away. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): It was Courtney who eventually broke the news to Ashtin and Briana. Their mother, their father's wife of close to 30 years, was dead. But neither Courtney nor Chris waited at the house to tell the sisters what happened or to comfort them, nor did they linger over the body at the hospital. They couldn't, because father and daughter were escorted to separate squad cars and driven to the police station to talk about the accident. What was that ride like? Quiet, you know? I just remember crying the whole time. I couldn't comfort my father. He couldn't comfort me. He was-
- when we got to the station-
- and they said that my dad would just be a few more minutes. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Chris, so frenzied at the scene, had calmed down by then. He was a cop among cops, after all. And he understood, he said, what was necessary to help them sort out what happened. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Happy to help, he said. Whatever would get him back home to comfort his daughters as quickly as possible. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Chris told investigators what happened. How as Courtney slept, he and Cristi were in the spa, bathing. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): As Cristi returned to the spa, said Chris, they passed each other on the patio. He went in the house, then, he said, stopped by Courtney's room to make sure she was awake, then went right back outside-
- and saw his wife floating face down in the spa. He called Courtney then, he said, and they began a frantic effort to revive her. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): From what? A fall? Must've been. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): But Chris apparently hadn't noticed the nasty 3-inch laceration on Cristi's head. And here, suddenly, the point of the police interview is revealed. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Not consistent with just falling down? Why would the police think that? KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Why, in fact, was this ex-police chief being questioned at all about the apparently disastrous accident that killed the love of his life? And the answer was right next door. When Chris and Cristi Hall took their outdoor bath that morning in June, someone was watching-
- her. I got up at 6:00, got my coffee. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Lindsay Patterson was on leave from her IT job in the Navy, visiting her mom, who lives just over the backyard wall from the Hall house. Lindsay was inside, in the bathroom that faced away from the Hall house and out on to the street, when she heard a noise. It was a horrible scream. It was just something-was-wrong kind of scream. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): A woman's, she thought. She went outside to tell her mom. And I said, did you hear that scream? And she said, yeah, but I think it's just kids playing in the-
- playing in the pool. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Kids? At 6-something in the morning? Lindsey walked over to the 6-foot brick wall between their yard and the Halls'. She stepped on the planter, she said, and looked over the wall. At that point, I saw a man with, um, his hand-
- one hand on top of a woman's head, and then one hand on her back. And she was face down in the water. Like something was going on? Yeah, it-
- that's what I assumed. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): That is, she thought she was looking at a sex act in progress. I don't know why it didn't seem right, but something made me want to look again. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Perhaps 90 seconds, she said, between her first and second looks. And this time, she said, she only saw the man in the spa. He's leaning back, just relaxed in the hot tub. But I don't see her. He's got his elbows back, and he's just kind of looking around, like nothing. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Where did the woman go? Lindsay told her mom something seemed strange. She again tells me, Lindsay, stop being nosy. Don't worry about it. Um, but it just didn't seem right. It wasn't enough time for her to have gotten out and gone inside the house. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So, said Lindsay, she went to the wall again, her third and final look. At that point, he was getting out of the Jacuzzi. Case And he was in a very big rush. And she's still nowhere to be seen. The look on his face was almost undescribable. It was almost as if he had just gone into another world. It was scary. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): It was instinct that told her something was wrong, said Lindsay. So she called 911. [phone ringing] KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So now, hours and hours later, the detectives confronted Chris with Lindsay's story. Why, they asked, didn't her story match his? KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So now that question we posed as we began-
- did Lindsay Patterson really know what she saw? CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): Dateline returns after the break <i> With Advil Liqui-Gels,</i> <i> you'll ask...</i> <i> What bad shoulder?</i> <i> What headache?</i> <i> Advil is relief that's fast</i> <i> Strength that lasts</i> <i> You'll ask...</i> What pain? <i> With Advil Liqui-Gels</i> [Music] 'Cos I know what it means [Music] [Music] To walk along the lonely street of dreams [Music] [Music] Here I go again on my--

What Chris did not know was that his neighbor had also talked to police, and she told a very different story than the one Chris was telling. Here again is Keith Morrison. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Chris and Cristi Hall's three daughters clung together in grief and shock all through the dismal evening hours of that worst of all days, June 7, 2007, waiting for their father to return from the police station. And they wondered why was it taking so long. Then the phone rang, and they had their answer. You know, it-
- broken-up words. And he's crying, and we're crying. And that-
- that was when he said, they-
- they think I hurt mom. I mean, he was very upset. But he didn't sound surprised when he said, they think I-
- He was crying. He was crying. He was upset. Very upset. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): But by the time police investigators were questioning Chris, remember, they had heard from Lindsay Patterson. And at the station, Chris's version of events in the spa differed in one crucial detail from what Lindsay described seeing that first time she peered over the wall and into the Halls' backyard. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): But investigators were getting a good look at Cristi's body, and saw wounds that, to them, suggested a struggle, and more than one nasty blow to the head. So the police had to choose which version, Chris Hall's or Lindsay Patterson's, was more likely the true story of what happened. Tom Dove is a senior investigator for the Riverside DA. I think they felt there was enough to say this was not an accidental drowning. It was clearly much more suspicious than that. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And so before the night was over, Chris Hall was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife. The girls could stop waiting. He wasn't coming home. It was obviously a tragedy, losing our mother that day. But this is a tragedy on top of a tragedy now. Just because knowing our-
- our parents, it's just-
- --the farthest thing from the truth. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And one that felt infected by some kind of madness, said the girls. Cristi was the love of their father's life, after all-
- the center of everything for him. How, they wondered, could anyone so happy in his marriage and his life be accused of harming her? And she was happy too, they said-
- as happy as she'd ever been. They knew it, they said, based on that mother-daughter talk they had not long before she died. ASHTIN HALL: She just kept reiterating. It was how happy she was. Kind of odd. And me and Brie will always cherish that. Of course, didn't think much of it at that time. Yeah. That that being the last time we actually saw her. Kind of burned into your memories. Yeah. KEITH MORRISON: Yeah. But right or wrong, the legal trigger had been pulled. Chris Hall spent almost two months in jail, until his daughters received the payout from Cristi's life insurance policy and used the money to meet his million-dollar bail. And then he went back to what was to be his retirement retreat to prepare, with the help of his daughters, for a murder trial. That's very surprising, to have a client in a murder case out on bail. But he was a special man, and, uh, this was a special situation. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): These are attorneys who would eventually defend him, though at first, they only heard about the case. Steve Harmon and Paul Grech. You've said two things there-
- special man, special situation. I think both of us can say that this is a man that-
- that we like and that we know, and we don't feel he could have done anything like this. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So Chris Hall and his daughters prepared for a trial which they hoped would make clear to everybody-
- the police, the neighbor, the world-
- that Chris would not, could not, did not harm the love of his life. There was never, in 30 years of marriage-
- never one moment of violence. There was no motive for this man to kill his wife. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Harmon and Grech had a look at neighbor Lindsay Patterson's eyewitness account and suggested it was really not conclusive at all. It was tragically incomplete. She saw three snapshots. What is missed by everyone is the wife getting into the Jacuzzi, slipping, falling into the Jacuzzi, hitting her head, going unconscious, and drowning. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): See this sharp corner sticking out into the spa? Hitting your head on this would certainly have opened a gash and knocked Cristi out, said the attorney. She didn't see what was really happening during the times when she was not looking. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): That scream that made Lindsay Patterson look over the wall? Lindsay, they pointed out, was in a bathroom that faced the street. She wasn't in the backyard when she says she heard it. Could have been anybody. And Courtney, who was inside her own house near the spa, didn't hear a thing. And we don't think that she's lying. We just think she misinterpreted what she saw. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And anyway, Lindsay, to a certain degree, concedes she didn't know what she was seeing in her glimpses that morning. LINDSAY PATTERSON: Something was wrong. And yet, you hadn't really seen any of it. I-
- no. But I knew something was wrong. I don't know if in my brain, I was putting things together. But from between the scream, the position that he was holding her, and then not-
- just not having enough time for her-
- her to have gone inside. So it's like you kind of got three different snapshots-
- Right. --of something going on in there. Right. And had to kind of work out-
- Yeah. --what this was. You know, I wasn't thinking at that point, oh, this man just murdered his wife. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): But now, based largely on that account, Chris Hall would go on trial for murder. And it was a trial for his daughters too. BRIANA HALL: He loved her. They were each other's best friends. And-
- and this is just-
- this is not fair to him, because he truly loved her more than-
- more than anyone. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And yet, the prosecutor was going to try to prove that this family man and former cop murdered his wife. Could it be done?

As prosecutors were preparing to lay out their case, Hall's daughters stood by him, proclaiming his innocence. Would anything change their minds about their dad? Here again is Keith Morrison. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Burke Strunsky is a hard-charging man-
- ex-member in good standing of the San Francisco DA's office, now senior deputy DA in Riverside. That takes skill, persuasive powers. Strunsky would need them in the murder case against the former police chief and family man, Chris Hall. Mr. Hall on the surface looks like a loving family man. He looks like a good father. He was somebody that had the support of his family. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So he did. But Strunsky wasn't buying the loving father and family man bit. No. When he heard about Chris Hall's very obvious grief, the wailing that went on after the so-called accident, the phrase that crossed his mind was, it's an act. And I think it was a wonderful performance by the defendant of acting like a bereaved husband. But when you look at his actions, um, how little he did to help his wife-
- KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Who tried harder to save Cristi? Not Chris, said the prosecutor, but his daughter. BURKE STRUNSKY: She called 911. She helped him get the body out of the spa. She is the only one that did chest compressions. He had no interest in truly helping his wife. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): A matter of opinion, of course. But Prosecutor Strunsky poked around in Chris Hall's past as a policeman. And what did he find? This man had an uncanny ability to fabricate stories. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Seven years earlier, while Hall was chief of police in Cascade, Idaho, he was charged with and convicted of misuse of public money. Embezzled $19,000, spent 10 months in jail-
- a white collar crime, hardly murder. But what struck the prosecutor is that he says Hall tried to cover it up. To plan a fraud, to lie about it-
- not just lie about it, but lie about it effectively. I think that was very telling ababout who we were dealing wit. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Suddenly, the prosecutor's prospects were looking better. At the trial, Strunsky made Lindsay Patterson his star witness, of course. It was her story, after all, that got the whole thing started. But almost as important, he called the Riverside County medical examiner, who testified that those lacerations in Cristi's head could not, in his opinion, have been the result of a single accidental fall. And the ME argued the particular type of bruising on Cristi's face and body was a hallmark of homicide. Sure. The totality of injuries were not consistent with somebody slipping and falling, and then a rescue attempt. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And there was a clump of hair in the bottom of the spa, still entwined with a broken plastic hair clip. That, said the prosecutor, could only have come from a violent struggle. When you lose that amount of hair, it's not reasonably explained by any kind of fall. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): There were some minor hiccups in the case. Lindsay Patterson, for example, was a little inconsistent about how long she looked over the backyard wall that first time she saw something going on. Was it just a few seconds, or as long as a minute? But either way, said the prosecutor, Lindsay was sure she saw physical contact. That was the important thing. He was given the opportunity to explain any physical contact that could in any way reasonably explain what Lindsay Patterson missaw. In other words, were they washing each other? Were they involved in a sex act? Was there anything that she could have misinterpreted? And at the end of the day, you're not just stuck with the fact that Lindsay Patterson made a mistake. You have to actually believe that Lindsay Patterson really hallucinated about everything she saw. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And what made Lindsay's story all the more convincing, said Prosecutor Strunsky, was she told it before finding out what happened to Cristi. She dialed 911 a full minute and a half before anyone from the Hall house did, before Lindsay had any idea how it would end. Here's what the jury heard her say in that call. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And she was still on the phone with 911 when Chris Hall came outside and found his wife's body floating in the spa, called out for Courtney. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The investigator, Tom Dove. I heard it best described during the trial as a cosmic coincidence, that someone could see something that they perceived to be more than just some kind of kinky action in the Jacuzzi in the morning, and then that actually turned out to be true, that a woman was actually drowned in that spa. That is not a coincidence. That is what she saw. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The prosecution's theory? Somehow, sitting in the spa that morning, Chris was overcome by some private fury-
- who knows what? A hidden violence is what Strunsky called it-
- and then killed his spouse when he thought nobody was looking. Chris Hall ambushed his wife, grabbed her by the hair, slammed her head twice into the concrete edge. He's holding his wife of almost three decades under the water, showing absolutely no mercy and no remorse, and an absolute desire to end her life at that point. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And then the piece de resistance. BURKE STRUNSKY: He then gets out of the spa, walks into the house, where his plan is to wake his 22-year-old daughter, who he-
- who he can use as a alibi witness. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): One little quibble-
- why? In fact, as convinced as he was of Hall's guilt, Strunsky conceded the why was a problem. Didn't legally have to know, he said, but he just didn't. There it was. It's emotionally unsatisfying not to have that answer, not to know the entire narrative of what happened. But you'd want to know why this guy, married to this woman for almost 30 years, apparently happily, would suddenly turn on her and drown her in the pool. Right. And I'm not sure we-
- we got the answers to that specific question. Uh, [inaudible]. Kind of an important question, isn't it? It's an important question, and a question that we ask in all spousal homicides. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So, proof enough? Or reasonable doubt? Almost three years after Cristi Hall's death, a Riverside jury would have to decide.

KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Chris Hall's daughters sat through every miserable minute of their dad's trial for murder here at the courthouse in Riverside, California. Their review of the prosecutor's portrait of their father? It was a lie, they said. It's hurtful to us to hear someone basically say that he knows our parents better than we do, and he knows our father's a sociopath, and that we're blind to it, and he knows that there was hidden violence in our parents' marriage, and we just didn't see it. You're basically telling us that we don't know that our whole lives were a lie. And there's-
- That is just-
- To top that off, there's no proof of that. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Chris Hall had never been violent, argued the defense; had no motive, no reason to suddenly turn on his wife. It had to be a freak accident. So, said the defense, Lindsay Patterson didn't really know what she saw. In fact if she'd really witnessed Chris Hall drowning his wife, why, then, didn't she claim to see Cristi's body in the spa when she looked again? Didn't make sense. But the highlight was the Hall daughters' testimony-
- emotional, quite powerful. So it put Prosecutor Strunsky in a strange position-
- at odds with the victim's own family. Things were so clear. If we had any inkling he had done this, believe me, we would have said so. BURKE STRUNSKY: And I think that's-
- And we would have seen it. I-
- I think that that's what they truly believe in their hearts. And, you know, it weighs on me greatly. But my job is to get justice for Cristi Hall. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Now it was up to a jury to decide. After six days of testimony, two days of deliberation, they couldn't. It was a deadlock. The judge declared a mistrial. Chris Hall walked out of court with his family free, but not quite in the clear, and nothing at all like a victory for the Hall daughters. What was it like to get that hung jury? What did you think then? That was-
- That was tragic. That was devastating to us. You expected a not guilty verdict? 
- Oh, yes. 
- Yeah. Not a doubt. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Deputy DA Burke Strunsky was disappointed too, and was also determined to retry the case. But first, he set his investigator on a mission-
- to explore the life and marriage of Chris Hall. And what do you know? In Idaho, where Hall had been a disgraced police chief, the investigator uncovered a startling accusation. Chris was a great, great conman. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Former Los Angeles police officer Jerry Winkle, the county commissioner up in Idaho. But once upon a time, he was Chris Hall's friend-
- that is, before a night of poker and booze, when, he said, Hall made a disturbing revelation that he'd shot himself in the leg when he was a cop in order to get medical retirement benefits. Chris had been drinking beer. And he came right out and told me that he had shot himself. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): But there was more. DA investigator Tom Dove had discovered a secret-
- not in Chris's past, but in Cristi's. TOM DOVE: There had been infidelity in the marriage for six years prior, while Chris Hall was in custody in Idaho. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Cristi's affair was relatively brief, years earlier. But she'd been in phone contact with the man just days before she died. Had Chris found out? Impossible to know. But when Investigator Dove talked to Cristi's coworkers at the clinic where she was an x-ray technician, several of them said they noticed a sudden change in her usually vibrant personality. One coworker offered more. She told us that she was contemplating a divorce. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): If true-
- and it was only an if-
- it might well persuade a jury. But also, Prosecutor Strunsky needed to explain what Lindsay Patterson saw or didn't see. Why didn't she see Cristi's drowned body when she peaked over the wall a second time? We were not able to explain to the jury why she didn't see Cristi at that point. And I think that allowed the defense to make the argument that Cristi Hall was inside. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The prosecution hired a water expert to do a recreation of the Hall spa. Andrea Zaferes has been assisting law enforcement nationwide with drowning investigations for the past 20 years. Zaferes got in the spa while Strunsky videotaped from the spot where Lindsay was watching. From the center of the pool and towards where Lindsay was standing, anywhere I was laying, you could not be seen from Lindsay's viewpoint. So once I sank below the surface and hit that bottom, you cannot see me at all from Lindsay's viewpoint. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And now the prosecutor was ready. In May 2011, one year after the first jury deadlocked, Burke Strunsky went back to court armed with his new evidence for a brand-new panel of Hall's peers. Jurors heard medical experts testify about the injuries to Cristi's head and, once again, heard Lindsay's 911 call. Cristi's coworkers testified for the prosecution. And Jerry Winkle traveled from Idaho to tell jurors what he thought of Chris Hall. I was ashamed to admit that he was once a police officer. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): But if the prosecution had upped its game in the year between the two trials, so had the defense. That's when well-known attorneys Steve Harmon and Paul Grech entered the scene, and they came out swinging. That story about Cristi's affair, for example? There's a shadow hanging over all of this stuff-
- um, a very human sort of shadow-
- which is that she was having a little affair, right? Had a boyfriend. Yes, if the husband knew about it. But the wife never, ever mentions it and tells the husband. No one tells the husband. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Quite right, said the judge. And because there was no evidence that Chris knew about his wife's affair, he ruled it out of the trial. The story about Hall shooting himself for retirement benefits? That was just absolutely a lie. That's wrong. There was never, never any evidence, or indication, or not even a moment's breath that he shot himself. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Anyway, the story was prejudicial, said the judge, so he threw that out too. As for what Lindsay Patterson says she saw-
- Chris Hall holding his wife's head underwater-
- the defense had prepared its own visual demonstration, had taken pictures from her angle at the wall, to show that it could look like two people were touching in the spa even if they weren't. This is what she described seeing in her testimony. OK. But on the closeup, what do you notice? KEITH MORRISON: They're not touching but they're in position where they could be. But that's different than actually touching. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Again, the Hall daughters were there every minute, their father's enduring champions. And this time, more family members came to court. Two of Cristi's own siblings testified for Chris. And said the same thing-
- we have not a doubt in our minds that this was, uh, not a moment of violence. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Mm. This was not a murder. The-
- the victim's own sister and own brother. That's an amazing thing to see. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Perhaps it was. But listen to this. The defense had one more very significant witness, a witness who oozed credibility-
- the sitting medical examiner from neighboring San Bernardino County, who stuck his neck way out to disagree publicly, in a court of law, with the medical examiner from Riverside. He found this to be an accidental death, not a homicide. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): This was not some ordinary hired gun. This was a public official who said straight out that Cristi's head injuries could and perhaps should be explained by an accidental fall. He didn't rule out homicide, though? He didn't rule out homicide. But he said the preponderance of the evidence was towards an accidental drowning. What I've-
- I've always been astounded by this-
- with this case is that the Hall family lives so close to the San Bernardino border, if Cristi had slipped and fell four or five blocks over, the pathologist in that county would never have filed criminal charges. An accident of geography. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So now a second jury would have to sort through these two sets of allegations, these two opposing realities, and decide whether Chris Hall would turn and embrace home and his loving daughters or a pair of handcuffs and a life in prison. CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): Dateline returns after the break. It's just a cough. Yeah right. And the earth is flat. Ahhh!! Treat your cough seriously with Robitussin CF Max. Nothing lasts longer and treats more symptoms for your cough, cold and flu. Robitussin. Because it's never just a cough. Welcome back. Chris Hall's first trial ended in a deadlocked jury. But with new evidence presented by both sides during his retrial, the jury was finally able to reach a verdict. Now, with the conclusion to our story, here's Keith Morrison. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): May 2011. For the second time, 12 men and women of Riverside County, California filed out of the courtroom-
- a second jury to make a life decision about Chris Hall. Did he murder his wife? Which of the medical examiners should they believe? Whose account of the defendant's character? And, perhaps most important, what did Lindsay Patterson see when she peeked three times into the Hall's backyard? Do you ever have those sort of little dark moments of the soul where you think, I may have misinterpreted, misremembered? That is something I've thought about every day, whether I misinterpreted, whether I think I saw something that wasn't there. I didn't see everything. Yeah? But I saw what I saw. And I know the conclusion of my story. I know it. I know it right here. I know it. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Of course, Chris Hall's daughters say they know the truth too-
- real thing in their hearts. I think that we were the three most critical jurors in that courtroom. Believe me, if we had heard anything or had any inkling that our father could have done this, as much as it would hurt and as much as we love our father, we would want justice for our mother. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The jurors deliberated two days, then broke for the long weekend. It was Memorial Day. Hall's daughters felt good. Things can only go so wrong for so long before something has to actually-
- KEITH MORRISON: Go right. --go right for us. We just did a lot of talking about the future and this, you know, being over, this being finished. And honestly, I was concerned about dad and how he was finally going to be able to grieve for the loss of his wife. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And then it was Tuesday, 8:45 in the morning. The jury gathered. And minutes later, a signal they were ready. Chris Hall and his daughters rushed to court. And in the end, it was very quick-
- guilty of first-degree murder. Their father would not be coming home, probably ever. He's being cuffed and potentially put away for life. And yeah, it hurts. And we are angry about that. You can still hear those daughters-
- I can. --accusing you of unfairly convicting their father. Absolutely. It weighs on me. But at the same time, I know who I'm dealing with when it comes to Chris Hall. In fact, he's the one that's stolen their mother from them. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): It had been a peculiar fact of this case that the victims' and defendants' families had stood solidly together against the prosecution. But what no one knew was the truth was more complicated. After the verdict, at Chris Hall's sentencing, a letter was introduced. It was from another of Cristi Hall's brothers, Billy Carlton, who, until now, had said not one public word about the case. We would like to ask His Honor for the maximum sentence, wrote Billy. The pain that my family has suffered through this tragedy is unforgivable. And I didn't want to hurt the girls. I had to say what was on my mind. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): There was a deep divide in Cristi's family, said Billy. Some of her relatives believed Chris was innocent. But he and, he says, others, including Cristi's uncle Steve Mundie, silently urged on the prosecutor. Half the family was convinced he was innocent and half the family was convinced he wasn't. And that's hard to do when you have a big family and you all have to be together every once in a while. And when it involves a member as loved as Cristi was. Exactly. Does that explain why this kind of group of people in the family decided just to let justice take its course? We had talked about it quite a bit. I think so. And you've got to know when to show up sometimes and when not to show up, just to keep what's left of the family as together as you can have it. Thank you so much for coming. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): When it was over, Hall convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life, some of Cristi's relatives met with Prosecutor Strunsky and thanked him. They wanted me to thank you for putting that guy away, because he's a murderer. KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And the Hall daughters? Having lost their beloved mother, fought to save a father they adored. COURTNEY HALL: It's a devastating reality. It really is, especially for our family that-
- now, to say that we were close is an understatement, you know? To go from that to being not able to be there with each other, it's, uh-
- it's the greatest heartbreak that anyone can ever experience, I think. That's all for this edition of Dateline. I'm Craig Melvin. Thank you for watching. [theme music] WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY VISIT NCICAP.ORG]
