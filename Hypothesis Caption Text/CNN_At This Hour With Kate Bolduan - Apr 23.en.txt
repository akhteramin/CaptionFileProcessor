Metastatic breast cancer is relentless, but I was relentless first. Relentless about learning the first song we ever danced to. About teaching him to put others first. About helping her raise her first child. And when I was first diagnosed, my choice was everyday Verzenio. It's the only one of its kind that can be taken every day. It gives us more time without cancer progressing. Verzenio is the only CDK4 & 6 inhibitor approved with hormonal therapy that can be taken every day for postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2
- MBC. Diarrhea is common, may be severe, or cause dehydration or infection. Before taking Verzenio, tell your doctor if you have fever, chills, or other signs of infection. Verzenio may cause low white blood cell counts, which may cause serious infection that can lead to death. Serious liver problems can occur. Symptoms include tiredness, appetite loss, stomach pain, and bleeding or bruising. Blood clots that can lead to death have occurred. Tell your doctor if you have pain or swelling in your arms or legs, shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid breathing or heart rate, or if you are pregnant, nursing, or plan to be pregnant. Common side effects include nausea, infections, low blood cells and platelets, decreased appetite, headache, abdominal pain, tiredness, vomiting, and hair thinning or loss. My relentless reason: it's them. My choice with my doctor: it's Verzenio. Ask your doctor if everyday Verzenio is right for your first treatment. Ok everyone!
