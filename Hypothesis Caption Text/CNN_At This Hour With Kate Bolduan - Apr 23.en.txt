 ABOUT 95% OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE DEBT.
 I SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT IS
 ABOUT REDUCING THE DEBT OF
 STUDENT LOANS.
 I HAVE FOUGHT HARD WITH SOME
 SUCCESS TO MOVE TOWARD MAKING
 PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
 TUITION-FREE.
 I WISH I COULD STAPLE A FREE
 COLLEGE DI UNDER■■■■■■■■■■■■ O
 OF YOUR CHAIRS.
 I DO.
 DON'T LOOK.
 IT'S NOT THERE.
 OH, I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST
 LOOKING TO SEE IF A FREE COLLEGE
 DIPLOMA WAS UNDER MY CHAIR.
 I WAS HOPING.
 WHAT YOU SEE THERE IS THE
 DIFFERENCE.
 ELIZABETH WARREN SAYING LOOK,
 WE'RE GOING TO FIND WAYS NOT
 JUST TO MAKE PUBLIC COLLEGES
 FREE.
 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO WORK ON
 DEBT.
 THEN YOU SAY HARRIS AND SANDERS
 SAY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, WOULD
 LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT IT.
 KLOBUCHAR, THE REALIST, THE
 PRAGMATIST GROUND, SAYING I
 WOULD LOVE TO DO THIS FOR YOU
 BUT I CAN'T.
 SO WE SEE ALL OF THAT.
 ANOTHER THING THAT CAME UP, WE
 WERE EXPECTING EDUCATION BECAUSE
 SENATOR WARREN RELEASED THAT
 PLAN YESTERDAY IN THE MORNING.
 THIS, I DON'T THINK ANYONE SAW
 COMING.
 TALKING ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS FOR
 FELONS.
 AND THIS IS STILL GETTING A LOT
 OF ATTENTION.
 THIS IS NOT THE LAST WE WILL
 HEAR OF IT.
 IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET A LOT
 OF ATTENTION.
 IT STARTED WITH WHAT BERNIE
 SANDERS SAID, LET'S PLAY THAT
 AND THEN SOME OF THE REACTION TO
 IT.
 GO AHEAD.
 I THINK THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS
 INHERENT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
 YES, EVEN FOR TERRIBLE PEOPLE.
 BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF
 THEY ARE IN JAIL, THEY'RE PAYING
 THEIR PRICE TO SOCIETY, BUT THAT
 SHOULD NOT TAKE AWAY THEIR
 INHERENT AMERICAN RIGHT TO
 PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY.
 SHOULD PEOPLE CONVICTED OF
 SEXUAL ASSAULT, OF THE BOSTON
 MARATHON BOMBER, SHOULD THEY BE
 ABLE TO VOTE?
 WHILE INCARCERATED?
 YES.
 NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
 I AGREE THAT THE RIGHT TO
 VOTE IS ONE OF THE VERY
 IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF
 CITIZENSHIP, AND IT'S SOMETHING
 THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE
 STRIPPED OF NEEDLESSLY.
 SO A LOT OF KAMALA HARRIS'
 ANSWERS, AS YOU HEARD, WITH THE
 EXCEPTION OF ON GUNS, A LOT OF
 HER ANSWERS WERE LIKE, I'M
 INTERESTED IN TALKING MORE ABOUT
 THAT, WHICH IS SORT OF SHE
 DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE A POSITION.
 PETE BUTTIGIEG CLEARLY SAYING
 NO, I DON'T THINK THAT FELONS
 WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED
 SHOULD BE VOTING.
 BERNIE SANDERS, LOOK, GIVE THE
 GUY THIS.
 THIS IS NOT A POLITICALLY SAVVY
 POINT TO TAKE, WHICH IS TO SAY
 YEAH, THE BOSTON BOMBER SHOULD
 BE ABLE TO VOTE.
 I MEAN, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
 THAT A POLITICAL CONSULTANT
 WOULD TELL YOU TO SAY.
 WELL, IN CERTAIN CASES WE NEED
 TO MAKE EXCEPTIONS, ET CETERA.
 SANDERS EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
 IN THE TOWN HALL WHERE HE SAID
 I'M PROBABLY WRITING A 30-SECOND
 AD FOR MY OPPONENTS.
 HE'S DEFINITELY WRITING AN AD TO
 YOUR POINT THIS ISN'T GOING AWAY
 ANY TIME SOON.
 YOU POINTED OUT KAMALA
 HARRIS.
 SHE NEEDED TO STUDY A LOT OF
 THINGS LAST NIGHT, BUT NOT, AS
 YOU POINT OUT, WHEN IT COMES TO
 GUN CONTROL, TO GUN SAFETY
 LEGISLATION.
 SHE WAS CLEARLY READY ON THIS
 ONE.
 OBVIOUSLY, KNOWING WHAT THE 20th
 ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBINE
 PASSING, SHE WOULD GET THESE
 QUESTIONS.
 LET'S GO TO WHAT SHE SAID.
 WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY
 LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY STARTING
 WITH UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS
 AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT
 WEAPON BAN.
 BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE
 COURAGE TO ACT.
 UPON BEING ELECTED, I WILL GIVE
 THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100
 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER
 AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO PASS
 REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
 IF THEY FAIL TO DO IT, I WILL
 TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION.
 RIGHT.
 SO IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH THE TOWN
 HALL, THAT IS IN DIRECT CONTRAST
 TO A LOT OF HER ANSWERS WHICH
 WERE MUCH MORE FUZZY.
 SHE CLEARLY WANTS TO STAND OUT
 ON THAT ISSUE.
 WE DO KNOW, IF YOU ASK
 DEMOCRATIC VOTERS, THEY WANT
 MORE GUN CONTROL.
 THAT INCLUDES REINSTATEMENT OF
 THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.
 OBVIOUSLY, IT HASN'T HAPPENED IN
 CONGRESS.
 I WONDER IF THEY VOTE ON IT.
 THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE ISSUE.
 HOW MUCH SALIENCE DOES IT HAVE
 AS A VOTING ISSUE.
 KAMALA HARRIS BETTING IT HAS A
 BUNCH, PARTICULARLY WITH
 PARKLAND, WITH THE 20th
 ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBINE.
 AN INTERESTING PLACE, SHE'S
 TAKING A STAND AND A HARD STAND
 THERE WHILE BEING RELATIVELY
 FUZZY ABOUT A LOT OF THE OTHER
 ISSUES WE RAN THROUGH.
 CHRIS CILLIZZA, ALWAYS A
 PLEASURE.
 JOINING ME NOW, CNN POLITICAL
 COMMENTATOR MIA LOVE.
 FORMER REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM UTAH, AND JOE TRIPPI, A
 DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST.
 JOE, AS WE LOOK AT BOAT OF THIS,
 I WANT TO PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT
 OFF WITH CHRIS CILLIZZA.
 IN TERMS OF KAMALA HARRIS COMING
 DOWN STRONG AND SAYING LISTEN, I
 WILL IN FACT ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE
 ORDER IF THAT'S WHAT IT WILL
 TAKE TO GET THIS DONE.
 TALKING ABOUT GUNS.
 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BERNIE
 SANDERS WRITING AN OPO AD FOR
 REPUBLICANS.
 IS THIS ONE ALSO, JOE?
 WE DON'T KNOW YET.
 YOU'RE SEEING CANDIDATES TAKE
 STRONG POSITIONS WHERE THEY WANT
 TO AND TRY TO LEAD THE PARTY IN
 THEIR DIRECTION.
 THAT OFTEN WORKS.
 IT OFTEN DOESN'T.
 I WAS WITH HOWARD DEAN IN 2004.
 I WAS HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
 WE LED ON OPPOSING THE WAR ON
 CIVIL UNIONS FOR GAY COUPLES,
 WHICH WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL.
 WE LED.
 WE STARTED RAISING MORE MONEY
 THAN ANYBODY.
 WE TOOK A LEAD IN THE POLLS.
 BUT IN THE END, THE PARTY TURNED
 TO JOHN KERRY, SOMEBODY THEY
 THOUGHT WAS SAFER, WHO WAS FOR
 THE WAR, AGAINST ALL THE THINGS
 THAT HAD CREATED OUR CANDIDACY
 IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 SO WHEN YOU SEE KAMALA HARRIS,
 WHEN YOU SEE ELIZABETH WARREN
 LEADING ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND
 ON FREE COLLEGE TUITION AND
 THESE KINDS OF THINGS, IT
 DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT
 THE PARTY IS GOING TO GO THERE.
 IT'S DEFINITELY SALIENT.
 IT'S DEFINITELY GOT A LOT OF
 ENERGY.
 WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM
 HERE.
 YOU SAW MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG
 IMMEDIATELY SLAP DOWN WHERE
 BERNIE SANDERS WAS GOING ON
 GIVING FELONS THE RIGHT TO VOTE
 WHILE THEY WERE IN PRISON, SO
 WE'LL SEE THESE FIGHTS CONTINUE,
 BUT YOU'RE SEEING A VERY DIVERSE
 FIELD ACTUALLY COME UP WITH A
 LOT OF DIVERSE IDEAS, AND SOME
 OF THEM WILL EMERGE.
 SOME WILL BE DUDS, BUT WE'LL
 SEE.
 IN TERMS OF IDEAS THAT ARE
 EMERGING, OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF
 THE CONVERSATION DRIVEN BY THE
 PROPOSAL WE SAW FROM SENATOR
 WARREN RELEASED YESTERDAY IN THE
 MORNING.
 CONGRESSWOMAN, I'M WONDERING, AS
 WE LOOK AT THAT, WHILE IT MAY
 NOT BE A PLAN REPUBLICANS WANT
 TO GET BEHIND, THERE IS A REAL
 DESIRE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A
 FRANK DISCUSSION ABOUT THE
 SOARING STUDENT DEBT, HOW IT IS
 CRIPPLING YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS
 COUNTRY, AND WHAT CAN BE DONE
 ABOUT IT.
 WILL THIS PUSH REPUBLICANS TO
 TALK ABOUT THEIR SOLUTIONS?
 NOW, HERE'S A PLACE WHERE I
 THINK THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET SOME
 SORT OF FOOTING, ESPECIALLY WITH
 PEOPLE WHO ARE REPUBLICANS WHO
 DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE THE
 PRESIDENT BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO
 GET SOME OF THOSE VOTES.
 THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S IN THE HOW.
 PEOPLE WANT TO SEE HOW YOU'RE
 GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET MORE
 STUDENTS AWAY FROM THIS
 CRIPPLING STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
 I WOULD SAY THE BEST THING YOU
 COULD DO IS FIND A WAY TO LOWER
 THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION.
 THEREBY GIVING AS MANY PEOPLE AS
 MUCH ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION
 AS
 IF YOU'RE SAYING I'M JUST
 GOING TO MAKE IT FREE, THE NEXT
 QUESTION IS SHOW ME THE PLAN ON
 HOW TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE I'LL
 TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WHAT'S NOT
 WORKING IS IMPOSING A 70% TAX TO
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
 YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW ARE
 YOU GOING TO PAY THOSE
 INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT
 THEY CAN ACTUALLY GIVE
 EDUCATION, AND BY THE WAY, HOW
 ARE YOU GOING TO HOLD THESE
 INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE
 MONEY THAT THEY ARE GETTING, THE
 UNLIMITED FLOW OF FEDERAL
 DOLLARS THAT THEY ARE GETTING,
 TO ENSURE THAT THESE STUDENTS
 ARE GRADUATING IN AN AREA WHERE
 THEY CAN ACTUALLY WORK AND THEY
 ARE NOT COMPLETELY INDEBTED WITH
 STUDENT LOANS?
 THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF
 CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK WILL
 ACTUALLY STICK WITH PEOPLE THAT
 ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE
 TO VOTE.
 AS WE LOOK -GO AHEAD,
 SORRY, JOE, WERE YOU GOING TO
 SAY ANYTHING?
 ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE
 GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE
 DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR PRESIDENT
 RIGHT NOW AND IN THE HOUSE ON
 THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.
 DEBATE WITHIN THE PARTY.
 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO -ALMOST
 NO DEBATE ON ANY OF THESE THINGS
 WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
 WHATSOEVER, NOT IN THE
 PRESIDENTIAL RACE, NOT IN THE
 SENATE, NOT IN THE HOUSE.
 IT IS JUST --
 THAT'S.
 THERE ARE NO ANSWERS.
 THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 WELL, IT IS TRUE.
 IT'S NOT.
 MOST PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT,
 THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE KIND
 OF DEBATE.
 I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS MORE
 YEARS AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.
 I TALKED ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.
 I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU.
 YOU'RE NOT IN THE HOUSE ANYMORE.
 I'M TALKING ABOUT WITHIN THEIR
 CAMPAIGNS THERE'S ALMOST NO
 DEBATE ABOUT MANY OF THESE
 ISSUES AND THE WAY THAT YOU ARE
 SEEING THE DIVERSE DEBATE ON THE
 DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHICH IS A GREAT
 CONVERSATION FOR THE COUNTRY TO
 BE SEEING.
 I'M NOT MAKING A HIT ON THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT THE BIG
 SPIRITED DEBATE SEEMS TO BE
 HAPPENING ON THE DEMOCRATIC
 SIDE.
 THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A
 LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO
 SET THEIR PLACE IN THE DEMOCRAT
 PARTY.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE
 THEMSELVES FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.
 RIGHT NOW YOU ONLY HAVE ONE
 REPUBLICAN NOMINEE OR WHOEVER IS
 PRESUMED THE NOMINEE WHICH IS
 THE PRESIDENT, SO --
 THE TRUMP PARTY.
 THE REASON THE DEBATES ARE
 HAPPENING IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO
 MANY DIFFERENT DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OUT
 THERE, AND THEY ARE TRYING TO
 SET A SPOT FOR THEMSELVES, A
 PLACE FOR THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN
 DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES FROM
 SOMEBODY ELSE.
 WELL, THEY ARE CERTAINLY
 GIVING US A LOT TO TALK ABOUT,
 AND THE GOOD NEWS IS WE CAN HEAR
 FROM ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE ON THIS
 PROGRAM, AND WE'LL DO MUCH MORE
 OF IT IN THE COMING DAYS AND
 MONTHS.
 THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING WITH
 US.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 THANK YOU.
 COMING UP, A CRITICAL
 QUESTION, OR IS IT ACTUALLY A
 VEILED ATTEMPT TO FIND

 CITIZEN QUESTION TO THE 2020
 CENSUS.
 WE'RE LIVE OUTSIDE THE COURT
 NEXT.
    Lease the 2019 RX 350 for   $409 a month for 36 months.
        Experience Amazing      at your Lexus Dealer.

      Metastatic breast      cancer is relentless,
   but I was relentless first.
  Relentless about learning the  first song we ever danced to.
       About teaching him       to put others first.
      About helping her      raise her first child.
 And when I was first diagnosed, my choice was everyday Verzenio.
 It's the only one of its kind that can be taken every day.
 It gives us more time without cancer progressing.
 Verzenio is the only CDK4 & 6 inhibitor
 approved with hormonal therapy that can be taken every day
 for postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2MBC.
 Diarrhea is common, may be severe,
 or cause dehydration or infection.
 Before taking Verzenio, tell your doctor
   if you have fever, chills,   or other signs of infection.
     Verzenio may cause low     white blood cell counts,
        which may cause        serious infection
     that can lead to death.
       Serious liver       problems can occur.
   Symptoms include tiredness,   appetite loss, stomach pain,
    and bleeding or bruising.
    Blood clots that can lead    to death have occurred.
     Tell your doctor if you     have pain or swelling
      in your arms or legs,
 shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid breathing or heart rate,
 or if you are pregnant, nursing, or plan to be pregnant.
   Common side effects   include nausea, infections,
  low blood cells and platelets,  decreased appetite, headache,
       abdominal pain,       tiredness, vomiting,
    and hair thinning or loss.
 My relentless reason: it's them.
 My choice with my doctor: it's Verzenio.
 Ask your doctor if everyday Verzenio
 is right for your first treatment.

 TODAY SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE HEARING ONE OF THE MOST
 IMPORTANT CASES OF THIS TERM.
 AT ISSUE, WHETHER EVERY PERSON
 IN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE
 ASKED ABOUT THEIR CITIZENSHIP
 STATUS FOR THE 2020 CENSUS.
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS
 THE QUESTION WILL STRENGTHEN
 FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS LAWS, BUT
 CRITICS SAY IT COULD ACTUALLY
 INTIMIDATE NON-CITIZENS AND ALSO
 HISPANICS AND AFFECT RESPONSE
 RATES.
 LET'S CHECK IN OUTSIDE THE
 SUPREME COURT.
 WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING?
 Reporter: WITH THIS DEEPLY
 DIVIDED SUPREME COURT REALLY
 WRESTLED WITH THE QUESTION OF
 WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION CAN ADD■ ■■,■■■■
 LIKE■■CATIV■■■
 END OF THE ARGUMENT SEEMED L■
  WERE GOING TO■■■■■■■■■■■ W THE
 JUSTICES"■■■■■!!!! ■ GOR AND
 CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS ■@DN
 POINT HE DID HAVE A QUESTION
 THAT WAS SYMPATHETIC TO THE VER
 WHO SOMETIMES HEAD FAKES DURING
 NOTED, LOOK, OTHERNTRIES
 HAVE SIMILAR QUESTIONS HERE, AND
 HE SAID THAT THE SECRETARYB ■■■N
 IN THIS AREA, AAAúE,
 ERICA, THIS■■ION HAS NOT
 BEEN ASKED OF ALL RECIPIENTS
 SINCE 1950, AND THE DATA THAT
 COMES OUT OF THE CENSUS IS
 CRITICAL.
 IT GOES TO THE ALLEGATION OF
 SEATS IN THE CONGRESS AS WELL AS
 BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FEDERAL
 FUNDS, AND THESE HALF DOZEN
 STATES CAME TO COURT TO ARGUE
 THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HURT
 TURNOUT FOR MINORITIES AND IT
 WAS GOING TO INTIMIDATE THEM
 FROM COMING FORWARD, BUT THE
 GOVERNMENT SAID, LOOK, WE THINK
 THAT THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO
 COMPLY WITH THE VOTING RIGHTS
 ACT.
 ONE MORE THING, ERIKA, IT'S
 IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THREE
 LITTLE COURT JUDGES HAVE RULED
 AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION HERE,
 PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT THE
 JUSTIFICATION, BECAUSE SECRETARY
 ROSS SAID, LOOK, THE DEPARTMENT
 OF JUSTICE IN 2018 ASKED ME TO
 ADD THIS TONNN■ON, BUT INFACT T
 TRIAL IT'S REVEALED THAT ALL THE
 WAY BACK IN 2017 ROSS WORKED
 WITH OTHER HARDLINERS WITH THE
 ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO FIND A
 WAY TO GET THIS QUESTION IN SO
 THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG TEST
 FOR THIS NEWLY SOLIDIFIED
 CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY HERE ON
 THE SUPREME COURT.
