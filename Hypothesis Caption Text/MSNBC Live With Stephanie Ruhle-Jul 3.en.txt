 PEOPLE. WE'LL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION
 MANY TIMES IN THE WEEKS TO COME.
 OTHERWISE, HAVE A HAPPY FOURTH.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
 RIGHT BACK AT YA.
 READ THE DECLARATION OF
 INDEPENDENCE.
 REMEMBER WHAT THE FOURTH OF JULY
 IS ABOUT AND THE VALUES WE WANT
 TO UPHOLD.
 I THINK THE SAME THING.
 WE SHOULD NOT BE POLITICIZING
 TOMORROW, FOURTH OF JULY.
 IT'S A DAY OF INDEPENDENCE, IT'S
 A DAY OF KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND
 REMEMBERING WHO WE ARE.
 WE CELEBRATE THE FOURTH OF
 JULY IN THE MIDST OF A SERIOUS
 MORAL CRISIS.
 WHERE WILL WE BE, WHO ARE WE?
 THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE WILL
 BE THE, QUOTE, SHOW OF A
 LIFETIME IN WASHINGTON.
 CHRIS JANSEN PICKS UP THE SHOW
 RIGHT NOW.
 GOOD MORNING.
 I'M CHRIS JANSEN IN FOR ALEX
 WITT.
 PHOTOS THAT SHOW SQUALID
 CONDITIONS AT MIGRANT CENTERS
 AND IT'S EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD
 THAN WE KNEW.
 THESE SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS
 SITUATIONS DETAILED FROM OUR OWN
 INSPECTOR GENERAL AFTER SURPRISE

 VISITS TO MULTIPLE FACILITIES.
 THOSE PHOTOS REVEALED NO HOT
 MEALS, NO ABILITY TO SHOWER.
 ADULTS GIVEN ONLY BOLOGNA
 SANDWICHES TO EAT, CAUSING
 HEALTH PROBLEMS.
 WHEN DETECTIVES SAW THEM, THEY
 BANGED ON WINDOWS AND HELD UP
 SIGNS, DESPERATE FOR RELEASE.
 ONE OF THE SIGNS SAID, HELP, 40
 DAYS HERE.
 THAT WOULD VIOLATE A FEDERAL
 COURT ORDER THAT MIGRANTS BE
 HELD NO LONGER THAN 72 HOURS.
 A SENIOR MANAGER DESCRIBED THE
 WHOLE SITUATION AS, QUOTE, A
 TICKING TIME BOMB.
 OUR OWN JACOB SOBOROFF HAS SEEN
 SOME OF THESE BORDER FACILITIES
 WITH HIS OWN EYES, BUT WOW, THIS
 REPORT, EVEN THOUGH WE KNEW SO
 MUCH, IT WAS SHOCKING TO SEE IT
 ALL THERE IN ONE PLACE.
 YOUR REACTION TO THIS NEW REPORT
 WHICH CITES IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND
 SAFETY CONCERNS NOT AT ONE, OR
 TWO, BUT SEVEN DIFFERENT SITES.
 YOU JUST READ WHAT I BELIEVE
 TO BE THE KEY PHRASE, THAT THIS
 THING IS A TICKING TIME BOMB.
 THIS IS NOT JUST A PHRASE THAT
 CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE
 CONDITIONS IN THOSE SEVEN
 FACILITIES IN THE RIO GRANDLY
 VALLEY.
 THE FACILITY I'VE BEEN INSIDE,
 THAT CENTRAL PROCESSING STATION
 THERE IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY
 WHERE THEY SEPARATED MORE KIDS
 THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ALONG THE
 SOUTHERN BORDER, THE TICKING
 TIME BOMB CAN BE USED TO
 DESCRIBE THE WAY THE BORDER HAS
 BEEN DETAINING MIGRANTS FOR
 DECADES.
 THESE ARE PRISONS, JAILS.
 THEY TREAT MIGRANTS AS IF THEY
 ARE PRISONERS, AS IF THEY ARE
 CRIMINALS COMING INTO THIS
 COUNTRY.
 THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN SET UP AS
 INTAKE/JAIL PROCESSING TYPE
 STATIONS WHERE NO ONE IS
 SUPPOSED TO BE THERE LONGER THAN
 72 HOURS, AND IT WAS ONLY A
 MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY WOULD
 SEE A SURGE LIKE THEY DID AND
 LIKE THEY ARE CIEGA LONG THE
 SOUTHERN BORDER TODAY.
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE TENS
 OF THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF
 THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO
 THE COUNTRY AND ARE BEING PLACED
 INTO TINY JAIL-LIKE FACILITIES
 THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR SINGLE
 ADULT MALES TO BE THERE DURING A
 BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME.
 IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING
 IN THIS DHS REPORT ABOUT THE RMV
 SECTOR, AND IT'S WHAT'S BEEN
 GOING ON IN EL PASO JUST A
 COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
 AND A WEEK AGO WAS WHEN THIS
 INSPECTION WAS DONE, AND THE DHS
 SAID IT REQUIRED IMMEDIATE
 ATTENTION AND ACTION, SO IT
 SOUNDS LIKE, AT LEAST IN SOME
 INSTANCES, THERE ARE NO MAJOR
 CHANGES IN THE LAST COUPLE
 WEEKS.
 IS THAT YOUR READ?
 THE CONDITIONS ARE NOT GOING
 TO GET BETTER QUICKLY IN THESE
 FACILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO THE
 FACILITIES THEMSELVES AND THE
 INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S DOWN
 THERE.
 THAT'S THE CONVERSATION GOING ON
 RIGHT NOW, PARTICULARLY AMONG
 THE DEMOCRATS.
 WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THE WAY
 THIS COUNTRY IS HOLDING MIGRANTS
 WHEN THEY COME INTO THIS
 COUNTRY?
 BUT I WILL SAY IF THERE IS ANY
 BRIGHT SPOT IN ALL OF THIS, JUST
 A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE WERE
 OVER 2300 -JULIA AINSLEY
 REPORTED THIS YESTERDAY -2300
 CHILDREN IN BORDER PROTECTION IN
 FACILITIES JUST LIKE THIS.
 AS OF YESTERDAY THERE WAS ONLY A
 COUPLE OF HUNDRED AND THEY'VE
 BEEN MOVED TO FACILITIES THAT
 ARE OPERATED BY HHS IN OTHER
 AREAS, NOT JUST AT THE SOUTHWEST
 BORDER BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
 IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE
 FACILITIES ARE GETTING ANY
 BETTER, IT MEANS THAT THE
 CHILDREN FOR NOW HAVE BEEN MOVED
 OUT IN LARGE PART, AT LEAST
 ACCORDING TO WHAT JULIA HAS
 LEARNED FROM CDP.
 I THOUGHT AT ONE POINT A BABY
 WAS BEING HELD IN A PLACE THAT
 WAS REALLY COLD, AND ACTUALLY
 THEIR HANDS AND FEET HAD TURNED
 BLUE.
 OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SERIOUS
 PROBLEMS HERE.
 JAKE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAY
 WITH ME, I WANT TO BRING IN
 BUREAU CHIEF PHIL RUCKER, AND
 FOUNDER OF STRATEGIES, AND SKD

 KNICKERBOCKER.
 SO PHIL, WE SEE THE
 ADMINISTRATION CITING THESE
 ISSUES.
 IS THERE ANY CHANGE HERE AT ALL?
 NO.
 RATHER THERE IS A FOCUS ON THE
 NUMBERS, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
 CROSSING THE BORDER, HOW MANY
 PEOPLE ARE BEING DETAINED.
 WE'RE HEARING FROM OFFICIALS IN
 THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THOSE
 NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DECLINING IN
 RECENT WEEKS FROM A HIGH IN MAY,
 BUT WE'VE NOT SEEN THE PRESIDENT
 REALLY FORCEFULLY TAKE CONTROL
 OF THIS ISSUE AND TALK ABOUT THE
 HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT WE SEE
 PLAYING OUT THAT'S SO WELL
 DOCUMENTED IN THAT IG REPORT AND
 IN THE REPORTING FROM PEOPLE
 LIKE JACOB.
 AND IT'S A HUMANITARIAN
 CRISIS, RICK, THAT IS UNFOLDING
 IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION
 SEASON.
 BUT EVEN DHS RESPONDED TO THIS
 REPORT BY SAYING CONGRESS'
 FAILURE TO ACT IS INCENTIVIING
 ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
 BUT DO YOU BELIEVE ANYTHING WILL
 CHANGE BEFORE THE ELECTION, OR
 HAS THIS ISSUE JUST BECOME TOO
 POLITICIZED?
 I WOULD LIKE TO STEP BACK AND
 PUT IT IN CONTEXT.
 THIS HAS OCCURRED OVER DECADES
 OF TIME, AND BOTH PARTIES ARE TO
 BLAME, AND I REALIZE THE
 REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION IS IN
 CHARGE NOW.
 BUT, LOOK, I AGREE WITH CHAIRMAN
 NADLER THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE
 HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
 YES, WE NEED TO WEED OUT THE BAD
 APPLES, BUT I'M GOING TO BE VERY
 CAREFUL ABOUT DEMONIZING THE
 BORDER PATROL.
 THE PROBLEM IS THESE FACILITIES
 THAT THE BORDER PATROL IS
 WORKING ARE NOT DESIGNED TO HOLD
 FAMILIES AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE,
 AND ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, FOR THE
 TIME THEY'RE DOING IT.
 SO I HAVE TO SAY THE BOTTOM LINE
 IS IF WE ARE ILL-EQUIPPED TO
 TREAT IMMIGRANTS HUMANELY, THEN
 I WOULD BE FOR --
 IT'S NOT IF.
 THEY'RE NOT BEING TREATED
 HUMANELY.
 THEY'RE BEING TOLD TO DRINK OUT
 OF TOILETS, KIDS ARE FREEZING.
 HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.
 IF I WERE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS,
 I WOULD BE SAYING, WE NEED TO
 RELEASE THE MAJORITY OF THESE
 PEOPLE TODAY.
 MAYBE PEOPLE WHO WERE KNOWN TO
 BE DANGEROUS WOULD STAY IN
 DETENTION, BUT THE MAJORITY OF
 THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE RELEASED
 TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT TOLERATE
 A COUNTRY THAT WE ARE TREATING
 PEOPLE SO INHUMANELY.
 WELL, I MEAN, WE HAVE 11
 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR
 PRESIDENT THAT ARE MEMBERS OF
 CONGRESS, BUT THAT IGNORES THE
 FACT THAT ULTIMATELY THE BUCK
 STOPS WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND IT
 IS THE PRESIDENT WHO PUT
 POLICIES IN PLACE THAT LED US TO
 WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
 YEAH, THIS REPORT IS
 ALARMING, IT'S SHOCKING.
 A LOT OF THE IMAGES WE'VE SEEN
 ARE ALARMING AND SHOCKING.
 I THINK IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS HOW
 BIG OF A FAILURE THIS WHITE
 HOUSE'S IMMIGRATION POLICY IS.
 FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, IT'S NOT
 KEEPING US SAFER AND IT'S
 INHUMANE.
 I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE
 FROM DEMOCRATS OVER THE NEXT FEW
 WEEKS, I THINK THERE IS GOING TO
 BE A HEARING NEXT WEEK IN THE
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WHERE THE
 CDP WILL COME AND TESTIFY.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE ALSO REQUESTED
 HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS AND
 THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS FROM THIS
 ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR
 IMMIGRATION POLICIES.
 AND THEY'VE BEEN MET WITH NO.
 THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REFUSED
 TO TURN OVER THIS PAPERWORK.
 WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION BLAMES
 CONGRESS, THEY'RE NOT
 COOPERATING WITH CONGRESS SO
 CONGRESS CAN HELP SOLVE THIS
 ISSUE WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION.
 SO THE BUCK DEFINITELY STOPS
 WITH TRUMP AND THEY'RE
 DEFINITELY DOING EVERYTHING THEY
 CAN TO STONEWALL HERE.
 WE JUST GOT FROM TWITTER FROM
 THE ACTIVE INVESTIGATOR THAT
 HE'S POSTED BORDERED PATROL
 PERSONNEL.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
 TO HEAR ABOUT THAT FROM KEVIN
 McALEENAN IS GOOD, BUT REMEMBER,
 HE CALLED THESE CONDITIONS
 UNSUBSTANTIATED AS EARLY AS LAST
 FRIDAY.
 WHEN YOU HEAR A CULTURE OF 9500
 BORDER PATROL AGENTS IN A SECRET
 FACEBOOK GROUP, THIS WAS FROM
 PRO PUBLICA TALKING, IN THE WAY
 THAT THEY WERE, IT'S HARD NOT TO
 GIVE CREDENCE OF THE ALLEGATIONS
 WE HEAR COMING OUT OF THESE
 FACILITIES.
 WE'VE HEARD THE REPORTS FROM THE
 DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO WERE
 DOWN THERE EARLIER THIS WEEK.
 I'VE SEEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS
 DOWN THERE WITH MY OWN EYES.
 AND, AGAIN, IT'S A POSITIVE
 STEP, I SUPPOSE, BUT IT'S
 CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO ALLEVIATE
 WHAT IS HAPPENING, AS RICK SAID,
 RIGHT NOW DOWN THERE.
 AND WE JUST GOT A REPORT, I
 GUESS, IN THE LAST 24 HOURS OR
 SO, JACOB, THAT A YOUNG GIRL OR
 A TWO-YEAR-OLD APPARENTLY
 DROWNED IN THE RIO GRANDE AFTER
 WE SAW THAT HEARTBREAKING
 PICTURE OF A FATHER AND HIS
 CHILD.
 YEAH.
 AGAIN, THIS IS ANOTHER HORRIFIC
 STORY OF A FAMILY WHO JUST
 WANTED TO ESCAPE THEIR LIVES
 WHERE THEY WERE TO COME FOR A
 BETTER LIFE.
 THIS REPORTEDLY WAS A HAITIAN
 NATIONAL WITH A CHILD WHO WAS A
 BRAZILIAN NATIONAL CROSSING THE
 RIO GRANDE.
 THEY WERE SEPARATED IN THE RIVER
 AND A SEARCH IS ONGOING RIGHT
 NOW BY THE BORDER PATROL.
 IF IT TURNS OUT THIS CHILD DID
 NOT SURVIVE, I WANT EVERYBODY TO
 REMEMBER THAT 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE
 DIED TRYING TO COME INTO THIS
 COUNTRY SINCE 1998.
 THE FAILURES OF OUR BORDER
 POLICY AS AMERICANS HAVE BEEN
 SYSTEMIC LITERALLY FOR DECADES
 IN DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN
 ADMINISTRATIONS.
 NOBODY HAS TREATED MIGRANTS MORE
 INHUMANELY THAN THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION, BUT THIS IS A
 PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN FESTERING
 LITERALLY FOR DECADES, AND NOW
 FINALLY, AS FAR AS I'M
 CONCERNED, IT'S REFRESHING, IT'S
 REASSURING TO HEAR ALL OF US
 DEBATING HOW WE FIX IT SO THIS
 DOES NOT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.
 WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHO THE
 "WE" IS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS
 ACTUALLY DOUBLING DOWN.
 YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE DYING,
 REPORTS OF ADULTS THAT ARE
 LITERALLY IN CELLS THAT ARE SO
 TIGHTLY PACKED THAT THEY CAN'T
 SIT DOWN.
 STANDING ROOM ONLY FOR A WEEK AT
 A TIME.
 AND YET HE'S SIGNALLING MORE
 DETENTIONS AFTER TOMORROW,
 IMPOSING FINES ON UNDOCUMENTED
 MIGRANTS WHO DON'T SHOW UP FOR
 COURT.
 PHIL, I WAS THINKING BACK TO
 WHEN THE FIRST LADY WENT DOWN AT
 THE TIME OF THE FAMILY
 SEPARATION AND SOME PEOPLE
 THOUGHT, WELL, MAYBE THE FIRST
 LADY AND IVANKA WILL IMPRESS
 UPON HIM THE INHUMANITY OF
 WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWN THERE.
 BUT IS THERE ANY SCENARIO THAT
 YOU SEE HAVING COVERED THIS
 PRESIDENT THAT SUGGESTS TO YOU
 THAT HE WILL SHY AWAY FROM THIS
 AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE?
 NOT AT ALL, CHRIS.
 THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE
 PRESIDENT BELIEVES IS A WINNING
 ISSUE FOR HIM.
 POLITICALLY HE BELIEVES HIS
 TOUGH STANCE ON IMMIGRATION IS
 WHAT GOT HIM THE PRESIDENCY IN
 THE FIRST PLACE, IT'S WHAT
 HELPED HIM DEFEAT ALL THOSE
 REPUBLICAN CHALLENGERS IN THE
 2016 PRIMARIES, AND HE BELIEVES
 IT'S WHAT'S GOING TO WIN HIM
 REELECTION.
 IT'S WHY YOU HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT
 IT AT EVERY SINGLE RALLY.
 AND HIS ADVISERS SAY THEY HOPE
 THIS ISSUE STAYS IN THE
 HEADLINES FOR EVERY DAY BETWEEN
 NOW AND ELECTION DAY, AND SO THE
 FIRST LADY CAN TRY TO PUT A
 SPOTLIGHT ON THE HUMANITARIAN
 ISSUE, ALTHOUGH WE'VE NOT SEEN
 OR HEARD ANYTHING FROM HER IN
 THE LAST FEW WEEKS HERE, AND
 IVANKA TRUMP CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT
 SHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT, BUT THE
 PRESIDENT BELIEVES THIS IS HOW
 HE WINS REELECTION.
 JACOB SOBOROFF, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH FOR YOUR CONTINUED
 REPORTING.
 EVERYONE ELSE, YOU'RE COMING
 BACK, SO I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
 COMING UP, IT'S AN ALL-OUT
 IOWA BLITZ.
 SEVEN DEMOCRATS CAMPAIGNING
 TODAY ACROSS THE STATE.
 DETAILS ON BERNIE SANDERS'
 STRATEGY, SOME BRAND NEW FUND
 NUMBERS AND SOME NEW POLL

 WE'RE NOW EXACTLY SEVEN MONTHS AWAY FROM THE IOWA
 CAUCUS, AS DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
 ARE AWARE.
 SEVEN OF THE CANDIDATES ARE
 BARNSTORMING THE STATE TODAY
 WHILE THE LATEST IOWA POLLS ARE
 RELEASED.
 KAMALA HARRIS IS SURGING IN
 IOWA, JUMPING INTO SECOND AND
 CLOSING IN ON FRONTRUNNER JOE
 BIDEN.
 ELIZABETH WARREN ALSO GOT A
 POST-DATE BUMP WHILE PETE
 BUTTIGIEG IS THERE.
 JOE BIDEN IS DROPPING NOT JUST
 IN IOWA BUT NATIONALLY.
 IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT HIS
 CAMPAIGN IS SWITCHING STRATEGY?
 THE STRATEGY WAS SLOWLY
 BUILDING THIS CAMPAIGN FROM THE
 GROUND UP, AND OF COURSE HIS
 TEAM IS POINT TO GO AN ABC POLL
 THAT SHOWS HIS SUPPORT ACTUALLY
 INCREASING, TICKING UP JUST A
 FEW POINTS.
 HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER HAD A VIDEO
 BRIEFING FOR SUPPORTERS LAST
 NIGHT, AND IN THAT BRIEFING HE
 SAID THERE WILL BE PEAKS AND
 VALLEYS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO
 STAY THE COURSE.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TRIP TO IOWA
 THAT SENATOR SANDERS IS DOING,
 YOU NOTICE A COUPLE SUBTLE
 SHIFTS IN HIS STRATEGY.
 NUMBER ONE, HIS FOCUS ON RETAIL
 POLITICS.
 THERE WILL NOT BE AS MANY
 TRADITIONAL RALLIES THAT HE HAS.
 HE'S HAVING ICE CREAM SOCIALS,
 THOUGH.
 AS YOU SAW LAST NIGHT, HE STILL
 GIVES LONG SPEECHES AT THESE ICE
 CREAM SOCIALS BUT HE'S TRYING TO
 MAKE PARADES AND SHAKE HANDS ON
 THIS HOLIDAY.
 THEY ARE OPENING THREE NEW
 OFFICES IN THE STATE OF IOWA.
 THEY'RE ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THEIR
 VOLUNTEER FORCE.
 THEY'RE SHOWING THEY HAVE THIS
 40s THAT CAN DELIVER HIM TO
 VICTORY COME FEBRUARY 3rd AND
 COME THAT CAUCUS TIME.
 THEY'RE FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON
 THOSE RALLIES BUT ALSO
 ACTIVATING THE SUPPORTERS AND
 GETTING THEM OUT THERE AS MANY
 CANDIDATES ARE HERE AND FOCUSED
 ON GETTING THOSE IOWA VOTERS.
 THE DEBATE HAS CATAPULTED
 KAMALA HARRIS WHO YOU'RE WITH IN
 SERIOUS CONTENTION.
 BUT WE ALSO KNOW DEBATE BOUNCES
 CAN BE SHORT-LIVED.
 HAVE YOU SEEN ANY ADJUSTMENTS ON
 HER CAMPAIGN TO CAPITALIZE ON
 THIS, AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW
 ABOUT HER FUNDRAISING BECAUSE WE
 KNOW SHE MADE $2 MILLION IN 24
 HOURS BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER
 QUARTERLY NUMBERS.
 Reporter: YEAH, WE HAVEN'T
 SEEN THE QUARTERLY NUMBERS YET.
 THEY EXPECT TO RELEASE THOSE IN
 THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.
 AFTER HER PERFORMANCE THE
 CAMPAIGN RAISED $3 MILLION JUST
 IN ONLINE DONATIONS.
 SHE HAD MULTIPLE FUNDRAISING
 EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE SHE
 RAISED AN ADDITIONAL $6 MILLION,
 THE CAMPAIGN TELLS US.
 WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THIS
 CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW COMING OUT OF
 THE DEBATE?
 THE REALITY RIGHT HERE IN IOWA
 IS THEY NOW HAVE 65 PAID
 STAFFERS HERE ON THE GROUND IN
 IOWA.
 THEY LOOKED AT THAT DEBATE AS AN
 OPPORTUNITY -AS BEING MORE
 THAN A DEBATE BUMP.
 THEY BELIEVE THIS SUMMER IS THAT
 MOMENT WHEN PEOPLE WOULD START
 PAYING ATTENTION.
 WE ARE AS OF NOW SEVEN DAYS AWAY
 FROM THAT IOWA CAUCUS.
 I ASKED KAMALA HARRIS, I WAS
 WITH HER IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE
 WEEKEND.
 I ASKED HER ON SUNDAY HOW SHE
 LOOKED AT APPROACHING THIS
 CAMPAIGN GOING FORWARD AND
 WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE AN
 APPROACH OF PROSECUTING THE CASE
 AGAINST HER DEMOCRATIC
 OPPONENTS.
 SHE WAIVERED WITHOUT ANSWERING
 DIRECTLY, AND I ASKED HER, WOULD
 YOU ASK FOR COMMENT FROM YOUR
 DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS.
 SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER THAT
 QUESTION, BUT SHE'LL BE HERE
 OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
 GARRETT, A NUMBER OF OTHER
 CANDIDATES ARE THERE TODAY.
 MONEY AND POLLS, TWO BIG THINGS.
 I DO ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING
 WHEN THE DEADLINE COMES, SOME
 CANDIDATES, USUALLY THE ONES
 THAT HAD A GREAT QUARTER, GET
 OUT THERE AHEAD OF EVERYTHING
 AND THE REST LAG BEHIND.
 ANY SUGGESTION ON WHEN WE'LL SEE
 SOME OF THESE OTHER NUMBERS AND
 WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR?
 BETO O'ROURKE SEEMED TO SUGGEST
 YESTERDAY HE HAD NO IDEA HOW
 MUCH MONEY HE HAD RAISED IN THAT
 LAST QUARTER.
 Reporter: YEAH, I DON'T BUY
 THAT FOR ONE SECOND, CHRIS.
 I'M SURE THAT HE MAY NOT KNOW
 THE EXACT TOTAL, BUT THESE
 CAMPAIGNS WATCH THEIR
 FUNDRAISING NUMBERS PROBABLY
 CLOSER THAN THEY WATCH THEIR
 POLLING NUMBERS.
 THE CANDIDATE WOULD KNOW WHETHER
 OR NOT THEY'RE ON TRACK TO HIT
 THEIR QUARTERLY GOALS OR NOT, AT
 THE VERY LEAST.
 A LOT OF THIS IS NEW CYCLE
 MANAGEMENT.
 O'ROURKE, YOU'LL REMEMBER IN THE
 FIRST QUARTER, HIS CAMPAIGN
 WAITED AND HELD THE NUMBERS OVER
 THE WEEKEND.
 I THINK IT WAS A TERRORIST
 ATTACK THAT HAPPENED ON A
 THURSDAY OR FRIDAY OR SOMETHING
 OF THAT NATURE.
 THEY DECIDED NOT TO RELEASE THEM
 BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT IT TO
 GET CAUGHT UP IN THE WASH OR
 LOOK LIKE THEY WERE BRAGGING.
 IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO
 BRAG ABOUT YOUR FUNDRAISING
 NUMBERS, TODAY IS THE LAST DAY
 TO DO THAT FOR A WHILE.
 IF YOU'RE CAUGHT UP IN THIS
 HOLIDAY WEEKEND, AND FOR SOMEONE
 WHO WANTS TO BURY THEIR NUMBERS,
 THEY'RE DISAPPOINTING, NOT WHAT
 YOU WANTED THEM TO BE, GREAT
 TIME TO NOT RELEASE YOUR
 NUMBERS.
 O'ROURKE IS HERE, BIDEN IS HERE,
 KLOBUCHAR IS HERE.
 I'LL BE COVERING A BUTTIGIEG
 EVENT LATER ON TONIGHT.
 THE THING ABOUT IOWA IS IT'S A
 PLACE YOU CAN GO TO MOVE YOUR
 POLLING NUMBERS, WHY BEING ON
 THE GROUND MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
 I CALL THESE THE SUPER VOTERS.
 PARTICULARLY IN IOWA YOU MEET
 THESE FOLKS WHO TAKE THEIR ROLES
 SO SERIOUSLY.
 LISTEN.
 SIMPLY NAMING THEM ALL CAN BE A
 FEAT.
 PETE BUTTIGIEG, ELIZABETH
 WARREN, AMY KLOBUCHAR.
 BERNIE SANDERS, JULIAN CASTRO
 AND INSLEE.
 Reporter: MEETING AND
 QUESTIONING THE DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES IS A DUTY AND A
 PRIVILEGE.
 HOW MANY OF THE DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES HAVE YOU GONE TO SEE
 SO FAR?
 I THINK BIDEN WILL BE 12.
 Reporter: 12?
 YES.
 Reporter: VOTERS IN IOWA SEE
 MOST OF THE CANDIDATES WITH MORE
 THAN 150 EVENTS HELD IN THE
 STATE IN THE MONTH ALONE.
 I'LL TRAVEL TO WHEREVER WE
 HAVE TO GO, YOU KNOW.
 Reporter: SOME SUPER VOTERS
 HAVE A CAUSE.
 WHEN I STARTED IN 2016, I WAS
 SO ANGRY.
 SHE LOST HER HUSBAND TO
 ALZHEIMER'S.
 SHE'S ASKED OPPONENTS ABOUT THE
 CAMPAIGN FOR TWO MONTHS.
 MY HOPE IS THEY WOULD PUT OUT
 A POLICY ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S.
 Reporter: IN NEVADA, THERE IS
 A GROUP CALLED MAKE THE ROAD.
 I WANT TO BE AS PREPARED AS
 POSSIBLE.
 I DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT OFF
 GUARD.
 HE COMES TO THE RALLIES WITH
 A LIST OF QUESTIONS.
 WHAT IS YOUR METHOD TO GET A
 CANDIDATE TO ANSWER YOUR
 QUESTION?
 TO CORNER THEM, IF THERE IS A
 Q & A SESSION, MY ARM GOES UP
 FASTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S.
 I'VE BEEN TRAINED WELL.
 Reporter: MARK CORVER HAS NO
 PROBLEM CATCHING A CANDIDATE'S
 EYE FOR A CHANCE TO GET A SIGNED
 BASEBALL.
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET
 PERSONALIZED YOURSELF, BECAUSE
 SOME PEOPLE THINK PRESIDENTS ARE
 LARGER THAN LIFE.
 THIS BRINGS OUT THE MORE HUMAN
 SIDE.
 Reporter: FOR ALL THESE SUPER
 VOTERS, PICKING PRESIDENTS IS A
 PARTICIPATORY SPORT.
 WATCHING THE DEBATE ISN'T
 ENOUGH.
 THEY WANT TO SHAPE IT.
 I'M ONE OF MANY VOICES, BUT
 IF I HAVE A VOICE HERE IN NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, I'M GOING TO USE IT
 TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY TO TRY
 TO MAKE A CHANGE.
 Reporter: CHRIS, TECHNOLOGY
 HAS CHANGED THE GAME HERE, TOO.
 THE EASE OF SHOOTING A VIDEO AND
 POSTING IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS
 GIVEN THESE SUPERVOTERS EVEN
 MORE POWER TO SHAPE THE NATURE
 OF THESE DISCUSSIONS.
 VAUGHN, IN THE SUNSHINE,
 SHACK IS NEAR A COFFEE POT, SO
 YOU TELL ME WHO HAS IT BEST.
 THE REQUEST OF PRESIDENT
 TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS IS ON A
 WHOLE NEW LEVEL AS THE DEMOCRATS
 TURN TO A GAME-CHANGING THREAT.
                                T
  I have one kid in each branch         of the military,
     but I'm command central.
     It's so important to us           that Verizon
 is supporting military families.
  When I have a child deployed,
    having a reliable network        means everything.
   So, when I get a video chat,
   and I get to see their face,
       it's the best thing          in the world.
    And I've earned every one       of these gray hairs.
   Military moms, we serve too.
 The network more people rely on,         gives you more.
     Like military plans with  a special price on Unlimited,
  $100 per line, and big savings
        on our best phones         when you switch.
         That's Verizon.

       Yeah, no, I'm good.
 NOW TO THAT BIG ESCALATION IN THE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS'
 FIGHT TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 TAXES.
 THE HOUSE IS SUING THE TREASURY
 DEPARTMENT AND THE INTERNAL
 REVENUE SERVICE OVER HIS RETURNS
 AFTER THEIR REQUESTS AND THEN
 SUBPOENAS OF THE RETURNS WAS
 IGNORED BY TREASURY SECRETARY
 STEVE MNUCHIN AND CHARLES
 REDDIG.
 NOW IT COULD ULTIMATELY BE
 FOUGHT IN THE SUPREME COURT.
 HE'S BEEN COVERING THIS FOR
 MONTHS AND ALSO AN MSNBC
 CONTRIBUTOR.
 AND ALSO HE'S WRITTEN MULTIPLE
 BOOKS ON THE PRESIDENT AND THE
 ADMINISTRATION.
 HE'S AN EXPERT ON TAX ISSUES AND
 HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THE
 PRESIDENT'S TAXES FOR YEARS.
 SO CHARLIE, THE WHITE HOUSE
 REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH THE
 SUBPOENA IS, AND I'M QUOTING
 HERE, AN EXTRAORDINARY ATTACK ON
 THE AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS TO
 OBTAIN INFORMATION NEEDED TO
 CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF TREASURY,
 THE IRS, AND THE TAX LAWS.
 SO WHAT IS THE WEIGHT OF THEM TO
 COMPLY?
 THEY'RE STONEWALLING CONGRESS
 WHICH IS TO SAY ALL OF THEIR
 REQUESTS ARE ILLEGITIMATE WILL
 STAND JUDICIAL SCRUTINY.
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS
 BEEN FIGHTING ALL SUBPOENAS AND
 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION EVER
 SINCE THE HOUSE WAS TAKEN OVER
 BY DEMOCRATS SIX MONTHS AGO BY
 SAYING THAT CONGRESS ONLY HAS
 AUTHORITY TO REQUEST INFORMATION
 IF IT'S THINKING ABOUT HOW TO
 WRITE A NEW LAW, AND IT DOESN'T
 HAVE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST
 INFORMATION TO UNCOVER
 WRONGDOING.
 AND EVEN WHEN IT SAYS IT'S
 TRYING TO WRITE A NEW LAW, THE
 BRANCH CAN SAY THAT'S JUST A
 PRETEXT.
 THIS IS ABOUT EXPOSING
 INFORMATION FOR POLITICAL
 PURPOSES.
 THAT'S OUTSIDE YOUR AUTHORITY
 AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
 TWO COURTS HAVE ALREADY REJECTED
 THAT ARGUMENT AT THE DISTRICT
 COURT LEVEL AND WILL OFFER
 SUBPOENAS BY CONGRESS TO
 FINANCIAL FIRMS FOR TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION RECORDS.
 NOW A THIRD JUDGE WILL GET A
 CRACK AT IT, AND THIS IS THE
 FIRST ONE COMING FROM CONGRESS
 ITSELF.
 HERE'S PART OF THE WHITE
 HOUSE STATEMENT.
 CHAIRMAN NEAL'S WILLINGNESS TO
 USE HIS POWERFUL COMMITTEE TO GO
 AFTER HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS IS
 A DANGEROUS DEMOCRACY.
 THE COMMITTEE HAS NO LEGITIMATE
 LEJS LAIFSH PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT
 CAN DEMAND THE PRESIDENT'S TAX
 RETURNS AND IT'S EVIDENT THEY
 ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN PARTISAN
 GAINS.
 CHARLIE, IS THIS PARTISAN?
 WHAT COULD BE IN THOSE RETURNS
 THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO
 CONGRESS?
 YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE UTTERLY
 NAIVE TO THINK IT'S NOT
 POLITICAL, OF COURSE IT'S
 POLITICAL, IT'S JUST WHETHER
 IT'S WITHIN CONGRESS' AUTHORITY
 TO DO IT REGARDLESS OF ITS
 MOEFSH.
 ON THE FACE OF IT, THE LAW SAYS
 THIS COMMITTEE CAN REQUEST ANY
 INDIVIDUAL'S TAX RETURNS,
 PERIOD.
 IT DOESN'T SET A LIMIT.
 SO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS KIND
 OF INVENTING ONE AND WE'LL SEE
 WHETHER A JUDGE GOES ALONG WITH
 THAT.
 WHY WOULD THEY WANT IT?
 THEY'VE SAID ON OTHER OCCASIONS
 THAT THEY WANTED TO SEE THESE
 RETURNS BECAUSE EVERY PRESIDENT
 UNTIL NOW HAS RELEASED HIS
 RETURNS AND THEY WANT TO ENFORCE
 THAT TRADITION.
 THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF
 FINANCIAL DEALINGS TRUMP HAS
 THAT MAY HAVE RUN AFOUL OF THE
 CONSTITUTION BORROWING AND
 RECEIVING EMOLLUMENTS, AND THEY
 WANT TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S
 FINANCIAL HEALTH IS AND WHETHER
 IT LINES UP WITH WHAT HE CLAIMS
 IT IS ON THE SCALE.
 SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF REASONS
 THAT THEY WANT TO SEE THESE AND
 THEY CLEARLY ALSO WANT TO MAKE
 THEM PUBLIC.
 BUT DAVID, WHAT THEY WANT TO
 PUT OUT THERE IS THE REASON THEY
 DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD TURN
 THEM OVER AND KIND OF PROTECTING
 THE OFFICE, NOT PROTECTING
 SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE IN THERE
 THAT WOULD LEAD TO PROBLEMS FOR
 THE PRESIDENT.
 TELL US IN CONTEXT WHAT YOU KNOW
 ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S RETURNS
 AND WHAT MIGHT BE IN THERE.
 ALL THE ARGUMENTS BEING MADE
 BY THE ADMINISTRATION ARE SIMPLY
 COVER FOR HIDING TRUMP'S TAX
 RETURNS.
 AND THE ARGUMENT THAT THE
 COURT'S GOING TO HEAR IS THAT
 TRUMP HIMSELF HAS MADE THE CASE
 THAT THERE IS A LEGITIMATE
 PURPOSE.
 HE SAID HE'S BEEN AUDITED BY THE
 IRS.
 HE CLAIMS HE'S BEING AUDITED
 BECAUSE HE'S A CHRISTIAN.
 HE CLAIMS HE'S BEING TREATED
 DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER
 PRESIDENTS.
 SO HE, IN HIS OWN WORDS, HAS
 MADE THE CASE HERE THAT CONGRESS
 SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS AS
 PART OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THE
 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.
 IN THE HISTORY OF THIS LAW WHICH
 WAS ENACTED IN 1924, THERE HAS
 NOT BEEN A SINGLE CASE OF THE
 IRS NOT TURNING OVER INFORMATION
 WHEN REQUESTED.
 IN FACT, THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON
 TAXATION HAS THREE STAFF MEMBERS
 WHO WORK IN THE IRS BUILDING
 BECAUSE THEY REVIEW TAX RETURNS
 EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.
 SO MICK MULVANEY, TRUMP'S
 ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF, HAS SAID
 THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL NEVER
 SEE TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS.
 DAIFRD, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
 WOULDN'T PLACE A BET ON THAT.
 THEY WILL SEE TRUMP'S TAX
 RETURNS.
 IF THIS ISN'T SETTLED BY THE END
 OF THIS CONGRESS, THE CLOCK WILL
 HAVE TO START WITH NEW
 LITIGATION, BUT WE WILL
 EVENTUALLY SEE TRUMP'S TAX
 RETURNS, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT,
 AND IN ADDITION THE NEW YORK
 STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE
 GOVERNOR WHO SIGNED LEGISLATION
 THAT PROVIDES TO THE WAYS AND
 MEANS COMMITTEE AND OTHER
 CONGRESSIONAL TAX COMMITTEES THE
 NEW YORK STATE INFORMATION FROM
 TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS.
 PEOPLE WATCHING SHOULDN'T
 FORGET, TRUMP WON'T EVEN RELEASE
 THE AUDIT LETTER, ABSOLUTELY
 ADODINE DOCUMENT THAT CLAIMS
 HE'S BEEN AUDITED.
 THEY HAVE STRONG REASON TO
 BELIEVE IT'S TAX SHEETS BUT THEY
 HAVEN'T NAILED THE CASE YET.
 SO CHARLIE, WHEN MIGHT WE GET
 SOMETHING ON THIS?
 WHEN MIGHT THIS ALL BE SETTLED?
 COULD IT INDEED GO PAST 2020?
 EASILY.
 A DISTRICT COURT JUDGE HAS TO
 LOOK AT IT.
 ASSUMING TRUMP LOSES, HE'LL
 APPEAL.
 AN APPEALS COURT WILL HAVE TO
 LOOK AT IT.
 WHOEVER LOSES THAT WILL APPEAL
 TO THE FULL APPEALS COURT.
 WHOEVER LOSES THAT WILL APPEAL
 TO THE SUPREME COURT.
 IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE THIS
 DRAGGING ON FOR A LONG TIME.
 ON THE OTHER HAND, THOSE TWO
 CASES I MENTIONED EARLIER
 INVOLVING SUBPOENAS TO PRIVATE
 BANKING FIRMS, THE LINE JUDGES
 WHO LOOKED AT BOTH OF THOSE
 CASES REMOVED THEM VERY QUICKLY.
 IN A MATTER OF WEEKS THEY SAID,
 NO, TRUMP IS WRONG AND ORDERED
 THE FIRMS TO COMPLY AND THEN
 TRUMP APPEALED.
 IT'S POSSIBLE THAT JUDGES CAN
 CHOOSE TO MOVE THIS ALONG AND
 NOT LET IT BE DRAGGED OUT, BUT
 FOR NOW IT'S CLEARLY THE
 STRATEGY OF THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM
 TO JUST BUY TIME AND STALL.
 CHARLIE SAVAGE, DAVID CAY
 JOHNSON, GOOD TO SEE BOTH OF
 YOU.
 AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S
 ACTIVITIES, WHY SOME MILITARY
 OFFICIALS ARE EXPRESSING
 CONCERNS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 CONTROVERSIAL FOURTH OF JULY
 CELEBRATION.
             NT TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL FOURTH OF JULY
 CELEBRATION.
     the clock is ticking on    irreversible joint damage.
    Ongoing pain and stiffness
   are signs of joint erosion.
 HUMIRA can help stop the clock.
     Prescribed for 15 years,
   HUMIRA targets and blocks a      source of inflammation
  that contributes to joint pain     and irreversible damage.
      HUMIRA can lower your   ability to fight infections.
      Serious and sometimes         fatal infections
     including tuberculosis,           and cancers,
       including lymphoma,          have happened;
      as have blood, liver,   and nervous system problems,
   serious allergic reactions,
       and new or worsening          heart failure.
       Tell your doctor if       you've been to areas
 where certain fungal infections           are common,
      and if you've had TB,
           hepatitis B,
     are prone to infections,
         or have flu-like        symptoms or sores.
        Don't start HUMIRA    if you have an infection.
       Help stop the clock
     on further irreversible          joint damage.
   Talk to your rheumatologist.
      Right here. Right now.
             HUMIRA.
            I switched to MiraLAX             for my constipation.
             <i> Stimulant laxatives</i>            <i> forcefully stimulate</i>
       <i> the nerves in your colon.</i>
              <i> MiraLAX works with</i>               <i> the water in your</i>
            <i> body to unblock your</i>               <i> system naturally.</i>
            <i> And it doesn't cause</i>                       <i> bloating,</i>
 <i>cramping, gas,</i> <i>or sudden urgency.</i>
             <i> MiraLAX.</i>      <i> Look for the pink cap.</i>
      <i> Make fitness routine</i>       <i> with Pure Protein.</i>
           High protein.
            Low sugar.
           Tastes great!
           High protein.
        Low sugar.
             So good!
                  High protein.
                  Low sugar.
           Mmmm,       Birthday cake!
          <i> Pure Protein.</i>
    <i> The best combination for</i>     <i> every fitness routine.</i>
       You've tried so many          moisturizers...
 but one blows them all
 out of the water.
 Hydro Boost with hyaluronic acid
        to plump skin cells
            so it bounces back...
            Neutrogena®
   And try our hydrating makeup.
 SO HERE'S THE PROMISE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TWEETING THIS
 MORNING.
 HE'LL GIVE THE U.S., QUOTE, A
 SHOW OF A LIFETIME AT TOMORROW'S
 EXPANDED JULY FOURTH CELEBRATION
 IN WASHINGTON.
 HERE'S ONE LOOK AT HOW THAT'S
 COMING ALONG.
 POLITICO'S HEATHER CAGEL TWEETED
 THAT A CRANE HAD TO BE USED TO
 GET AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE.
 THERE IS ALSO A REPORT THAT THE
 EXTRAVAGANZA THAT HE'S WANTED TO
 HAVE FOR TWO YEARS NOW WILL
 BALLOON TO $25 MILLION AND WILL
 MEAN LESS MONEY FOR THE NATIONAL
 PARKS.
 THE NATIONAL PARKS HAS DIVERTED
 $2.5 MILLION IN FEES TO COVER
 SOME OF THE COSTS.
 MONICA ALBA JOINS US NOW WITH
 MORE FROM THE CAPITOL MALL.
 WE KNOW THE PENTAGON HAS
 SCRAMBLED TO GET TOGETHER ON
 SHORT NOTICE WHAT THE WHITE
 HOUSE NEEDS.
 WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON THE
 GROUND?
 Reporter: YOU CAN SEE RIGHT
 HERE NEXT TO ME, THESE ARE
 ACTUALLY TWO BRADLEY FIGHTING
 VEHICLES.
 THIS IS JUST SOME OF THE
 MILITARY MIGHT THAT IS EXPECTED
 TO BE ON FULL DISPLAY TOMORROW
 NIGHT HERE, OF COURSE, ON THE
 NATIONAL MALL RIGHT BEHIND ME.
 THIS IS JUST SOME OF AN EXAMPLE.
 YOU MENTIONED THAT THEY WERE
 MOVED OVERNIGHT ON TRAINS AND ON
 FLATBED TRUCKS BECAUSE THESE
 TANKS ARE SO HEAVY.
 THE PRESIDENT FELL IN LOVE WITH
 THIS TWO YEARS AGO IN PARIS ON
 BASTILLE DAY AND WANTED TO
 RECREATE IT, BUT A LOT OF
 CRITICS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER
 HE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS EVENT
 THAT IS TYPICALLY NONPARTISAN
 PARTISAN, WHETHER HE'LL GO INTO
 A CAMPAIGN MODE.
 WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE SPEECH HE'S
 GOING TO GIVE, WHETHER IT WILL
 UNIFY ALL AMERICANS, HE SAID, I
 THINK SO, BUT HE'S GOING TO TALK
 ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.
 TOURISTS ARE HERE.
 IT'S JUST ANOTHER HOT SUMMER
 DAY.
 TOMORROW THIS WILL LOOK
 DIFFERENT WITH MANY PEOPLE
 EXPECTED ON THE MALL.
 CHRIS?
 MONICA ALBA, THANK YOU FOR
 THAT.
 PHIL RUCKER IS BACK WITH ME AS
 WELL AS JACK JACOBS, A MEDAL
 AFTER HONOR RECIPIENT AND MSNBC
 MILITARY CONTRIBUTOR.
 PHIL, YOU SAID, QUOTE, THIS
 YEAR'S GATHERING ON THE MALL
 MARKS A DEPARTURE BECAUSE
 PRESIDENTS TYPICALLY HAVE NOT
 PARTICIPATED IN INDEPENDENCE DAY
 CELEBRATIONS.
 WHY INDEPENDENCE DAY IF YOU'RE
 DOING A MILITARY PARADE?
 WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT ALL
 THIS, BECAUSE IT WAS ALL PRETTY
 FAST.
 THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO DO A
 MILITARY PARADE AND THOSE PLANS
 WERE THWARTED BY THE GOVERNMENT
 OVER CONCERNS ABOUT COST AND
 JUST INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS
 WITH ROLLING TANKS THROUGH THE
 STREETS OF A CITY.
 SO THE PARADE WAS NOT TO BE.
 THE PRESIDENT SEIZED ON THIS
 JULY 4th MOMENT AS A CHANCE TO
 PUT HIS OWN MARK ON WHAT HAS
 HISTORICALLY BEEN A DECIDEDLY
 NONPARTISAN CELEBRATION IN THE
 NATION'S CAPITOL.
 HE'S WANTED TO HAVE BIGGER
 FIREWORKS THAN NORMAL, HE'S
 WANTED TO PUT HIMSELF AT CENTER
 STAGE, HE'S GIVEN OUT VIP
 TICKETS TO HIS POLITICAL DONORS,
 AND MEANWHILE IT'S BEING FUNDED
 BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOT BY HIS
 CAMPAIGN.
 AND IN FACT MY COLLEAGUES AT THE
 POST HAVE REPORTED LAST NIGHT
 THAT $2.5 MILLION ON NATIONAL
 PARK ENTRY FEES, THESE ARE THE
 FEES YOU PAY WHEN YOU GO TO
 VISIT YOSEMITE OR YELLOWSTONE OR
 ANY OF THESE NATIONAL PARKS,
 THAT THAT MONEY HAS BEEN
 DIVERTED AWAY FROM THE PARKS TO
 HELP FUND TOMORROW'S
 CELEBRATION.
 THERE ARE, COLONEL, AS YOU
 KNOW, RUSSIA HAS VICTORY DAY, WE
 MENTIONED HE WAS AT BASTILLE DAY
 WHERE HE KIND OF GOT THE IDEA
 THAT HE WANTED THIS.
 DO YOU SHARE THE CONCERNS WE'VE
 HEARD FROM FORMER MILITARY
 OFFICERS THAT, LOOK, YOU HAVE TO
 KEEP THIS STUFF APOLITICAL, AND
 IT CLEARLY IS NOT?
 I DO, AND PEOPLE I'VE TALKED
 TO DO AS WELL.
 WE'VE HAD A LONG HISTORY
 TRADITION OF AGO AN APOLITICAL
 FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
 WE'RE CELEBRATING THE FOUNDER OF
 THE COUNTRY, NOT CELEBRATING OUR
 MILITARY MIGHT.
 THE THING THAT CONCERNS ME THE
 MOST IS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T
 HAVE TO SHOW OUR MILITARY MIGHT.
 YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TANK
 COUNTRIES AND THERE ARE NON TANK
 COUNTRIES.
 WE ARE A NON-TANK COUNTRIES.
 IRAN IS A TANK COUNTRY.
 NORTH KOREA, RUSSIA, CHINA,
 THOSE ARE ALL TANK COUNTRIES.
 WE DON'T HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE --
 AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S PART
 OF OUR STRENGTH THAT WE DON'T
 HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR STRENGTH
 IN THIS WAY.
 AND THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE
 DRAWS IS THAT THIS IS MERELY
 A -IT'S NOT EVEN A THINLY
 VEILED CAMPAIGN EVENT, IT LOOKS
 EXACTLY LIKE A CAMPAIGN EVENT
 AND IT PANDERS TO THE LEAST
 SAVORY OF ALL OF OUR POLITICAL
 NOTIONS, CHRIS.
 WELL, THE OTHER THING, I
 THINK, THAT WE'RE SEEING A
 LITTLE BIT HERE, PHIL, IS THAT
 THIS IS IN SOME WAYS NOT UNLIKE
 THE PRESIDENT TWEETING THAT HE'D
 LIKE TO MEET KIM JONG-UN AT THE
 DMZ, AND THEN THERE'S A BIG
 SCRAMBLING.
 THE PRESS SECRETARY GETS CAUGHT
 IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND ALL
 THESE THINGS NEED TO GET DONE AT
 THE LAST MINUTE.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S WHAT
 HAPPENED WITH PENTAGON IN THIS
 CASE.
 CHRIS, I THINK WHAT'S GOING
 ON HERE IS THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
 IS TRYING TO PRODUCE THIS EVENT.
 REMEMBER, HIS BACKGROUND IS IN
 PUTTING ON REALITY TELEVISION
 SHOWS.
 HE CARES INTENSELY ABOUT THE
 STAGING OF HIS POLITICAL
 RALLIES, ABOUT WHAT GOES WHERE,
 WHAT EQUIPMENT WOULD BE
 INVOLVED.
 HE'S BEEN VERY HANDS-ON IN THE
 LAST FEW WEEKS IN PUTTING
 TOGETHER THE PLANS FOR THE
 FOURTH OF JULY ON THE MALL.
 CURRENTLY JACK, DOES IT
 BOTHER YOU WITH EVERYTHING THAT
 IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD,
 MULTIPLE NUCLEAR THREATS AMONG
 THEM, THAT THIS IS HOW THE
 PRESIDENT IS SPENDING HIS TIME?
 WELL, OF COURSE, IT'S
 BOTHERSOME, BUT DON'T FORGET --
 LOOK, HE'S NOT ALONE.
 ALL PRESIDENTS ARE ALWAYS
 CAMPAIGNING, ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
 BUT THIS IS REALLY IN YOUR FACE,
 AND IT'S CLEAR THAT HIS FOCUS IS
 LESS CLEAR ON THE KIND OF THINGS
 THAT KEEP US FREE THAN THINGS
 THAT LOOK LIKE THEY KEEP US
 FREE.
 YOU JUST HAVE TO GO BACK A
 COUPLE WEEKS AND TAKE A LOOK AT
 THE POSITIVITY OF INTELLIGENT
 AND STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING
 TAKING PLACE JUST IN THE LAST
 FEW WEEKS WITH IRAN BEING
 AGGRESSIVE IN THE GULF, THE
 ATTACKS ON THE SHIPS THERE,
 WHAT'S TAKEN PLACE IN IRAN NOW,
 PLUS UPPING ITS NUCLEAR
 CAPABILITY.
 NO RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED
 STATES TO SPEAK OF.
 SAME THING IN KOREA AND NORTH
 KOREA, CHINA SPREADING OUT
 ACROSS THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND
 SO ON.
 THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF
 THINGS WE NEED TO DO WITH OUR
 MILITARY.
 THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM.
 COLONEL JACK JACOBS, ALWAYS
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 HAPPY FOURTH, AND TO YOU, PHIL
 RUCKER, AS WELL.
 THANKS, GUYS.
 UP NEXT, IT MIGHT NOT COME
 AS A SURPRISE THAT POLLS SHOW
 ELIZABETH WARREN AND KAMALA
 HARRIS GETTING A BUMP AFTER
 THEIR DEBATE PERFORMANCES, BUT A
 NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS EXACTLY WHERE
 THEIR GAINS ARE COMING FROM.
 THIS MORNING A NEW
 WASHINGTON POST/ABC POLL SHOWS
 WHILE KAMALA HARRIS AND
 ELIZABETH WARREN DID GET A
 BOOST, JOE BIDEN STILL LEADS.
 AND THAT LEAD HAS DIMINISHED,
 THOUGH HE REMAINS AT THE TOP OF
 EVERY NATIONAL POLL WE HAVE SEEN
 SINCE THE DEBATES.
 THIS MORNING WE MAY KNOW WHY.
 IT GOES BEYOND IOWA AND BEYOND
 THE NOMINATION.
 45% OF VOTERS THINK THAT HE IS
 THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP
 IN THE GENERAL LOCATION.
 JOINING ME TO WEIGH IN IS
 FOUNDER OF PULSO, A SOCIAL
 MEDIA.
 TYLER ARE BACK WITH ME.
 DOUG, DO YOU THINK IT'S THAT
 SIMPLE?
 BIDEN IS STILL IN THE LEAD
 BECAUSE HE IS VIEWED AS MORE
 MODERATE AND DEMOCRATS THINK HE
 CAN WIN IN THE GENERAL?
 WELL, I THINK IT IS BECAUSE
 HE HAS A BROAD COALITION OF
 SUPPORT.
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN A
 BASE OF HIS SUPPORT SINCE HE
 STARTED.
 HE'S DOING WELL WITH OLDER
 VOTERS.
 HE'S DOING WELL WITH MODERATE
 VOTERS.
 SO HE'S GOT A BROADER COALITION.
 DEPENDING WHAT POLLS YOU LOOK
 AT, THEY ARE SAYING DIFFERENT
 THINGS.
 I WOULD JUST BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT
 INTERPRETING THEM TOO MUCH UNTIL
 A COUPLE WEEKS AFTER THE DEBATES
 HAVE PASSED.
 WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU
 SOMETHING, THOUGH.
 THIS IS INTERESTING.
 5:38 DID SOMETHING REALLY SMART.
 THEY TOOK A GROUP OF VOTERS
 BEFORE THE DEBATES AND POLLED
 THEM.
 THEN THEY DID ONE AFTER THE
 DEBATE.
 SO YOU ACTUALLY SEE HOW THE
 DEBATES MOVED THINGS.
 THE BIG WINNER, KAMALA HARRIS UP

 JULIAN CASTRO, ELIZABETH WARREN
 ALSO GAINING.
 DOWN IS JOE BIDEN, BETO O'ROURKE
 AND PETE BUTTIGIEG.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT, LIZ?
 I WOULD SAY THERE ARE SEVERAL
 POLLS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING
 AT.
 THE POLL THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY
 THAT SURVEYED VOTERS SHOWED THAT
 KAMALA HARRIS WENT UP FROM SIXTH
 PLACE UP TO FIRST AND JULIAN
 CASTRO HAD A BIG JUMP.
 WE KNOW THAT THE LATIN COMMUNITY
 WILL BE THE LARGEST MINORITY
 VOTING BLOC IN 2020.
 HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?
 HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?
 WELL, MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
 OUR COMMUNITY IS INCREASING NOT
 ONLY IN VOTING AGE BUT NUMBERS
 OVERALL.
 WILL 00,000 EVERY SINGLE DAY.
 SO WE KNOW THE CANDIDATE THAT IS
 ELECTED IN 2020 IN THE
 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES WILL NOT
 WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION.
 SO THERE IS A LOT OF TALK
 ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHO WON, WHO
 LOST AND, RICK, I THINK THESE
 POLLS AREN'T JUST BEING WATCHED
 CLOSELY BY THESE CAMPAIGNS BUT
 BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
 WHAT DO THEY TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT
 WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR?
 WELL, I THINK JOE BIDEN HAS
 BEEN MOVED.
 HARRIS IS RIGHT WHERE SHE WANTS
 TO BE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TO
 BE THE FRONT RUNNER THIS EARLY
 O.
 WOULDN'T TRUMP RATHER RUN
 AGAINST HER THAN BIDEN?
 IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY.
 THE LEADERS WILL SHIFT A LITTLE
 BIT.
 LOST GROUND IN EVERY
 DEMOGRAPHIC.
 IT PROBABLY CAME OUT OF JOE
 BIDEN.
 ELIZABETH WARREN WAS FLAT
 ACTUALLY.
 SHE LOST SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT.
 JOE BIDEN STILL REMAINS THE TOP
 OF THE HEAP AND THE PERSON
 BELIEVE WILL BEAT DONALD TRUMP.
 KAMALA HARRIS HAS IMPROVED
 SIGNIFICANTLY IN HER
 BELIEVABILITY SHE CAN BEAT
 DONALD TRUMP.
 THAT IS A HUGE FACTOR THIS TIME
 AROUND.
 OBVIOUSLY, DOUG, YOU HAVE TO
 BUILD A WINNING COALITION.
 A NEW PIECE BY ALEX SIGHTSWALD
 WHO WRITES HARRIS STUNNED BIDEN
 BUT CAN SHE WIN AN OBAMA
 COALITION?
 FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AT THIS
 POINT, WHO IS DOING THE RIGHT
 THINGS TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION.
 YOU START PUTTING ORGANIZERS
 ON THE GROUND.
 KAMALA HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN IS
 DOING THAT MORE AND MORE IN IOWA
 AND SOUTH CAROLINA.
 ELIZABETH WARREN HAS A HUGE
 FIELD STAFF SHE HAS INVESTED IN
 A NUMBER OF KEY EARLY STATES.
 SO HAVING THAT DIRECT
 PERSON-TO-PERSON COMMUNICATION
 IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF
 BUILDING OUT YOUR COALITION.
 WHEN THE CANDIDATES START TO
 ADVERTISE AND GET THEIR MESSAGE
 OUT, THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY
 IMPORTANT.
 BUT, LOOK, I WOULD JUST -I
 WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH ONE THING
 THAT RICK SAID.
 I THINK WITH KAMALA HARRIS, YOU
 KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM TO
 GROW.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW HER
 OR ELIZABETH WARREN.
 BOTH DID VERY WELL.
 LIZ WETTING WARREN DID WELL AS
 WELL.
 SEIZE THE DAY, RIGHT?
 THANKS TO ALL OF YOU.
 HAPPY FOURTH.
 RASHIDA TALIB WILL BE HERE TO
 TALK ABOUT THE DETENTION CENTERS
 AND WHAT SHE WITNESSED.
                        ENTION CS AND WHAT SHE WITNESSED
