- Deal! 
- Deal. You're taking $70. Her case had the penny! The penny was there. Open your case. Tony Oriente could not find the end of the rainbow and is leaving with $70. I'm certain that this won't dampen the light that Tony brings anywhere he goes. That's it for us. We'll see you next time right here on Deal or No Deal. 
>> Tonight on Jay Leno's Garage... 
>> Show me what you got! 
>> We talk about what I took up in school... space. This is called Scarecrow. 
>> Because it doesn't have a brain. 
>> It's influenced car design, technology, and our imagination. It was a car I dreamed about when I was 15 years old. But is space the final frontier for cars? 
>> Yes! Yes. 
>> To find out, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and I get an education in going fast. [screams] [laughter] Like, three times the speed of sound, fast. 
>> You've got a mean fighting machine. 
>> Pop culture historian Charles Phoenix gives me a tour of mid-century atomic age design. 
>> It is the epitome of Space Age style. 
>> We'll play America's favorite car game with well-known space expert, Tim Allen. I can't punch you in the face. 
>> You could if you really wanted to. 
>> I do really want to. I'll get behind the controls of the most sophisticated vehicle I've ever driven. Oh, no! That can't happen. NASA's $2.5 billion Mars Rover. [cheering] 'Cause tonight, it's all about astronomical speeds, cosmic designs, and stellar characters. So gear up, 'cause this episode is gonna be out of this world. I'm coming for you! [upbeat music] [rock music] I'm on a lonely road in the middle of the California desert. The car I'm driving, a 1969 Corvette. [cash register bell rings] But not just any Corvette, this Corvette was owned by Alan Bean, fourth man to walk on the Moon. Back in the '60s, General Motors had a program where the astronauts could lease a brand-new Corvette for a dollar a year, and all of them took advantage of it. But three of the astronauts, Dick Gordon, Charles Conrad, and Alan Bean, the owner of this car, wanted very special Corvettes. Theirs were gold with the black with a 427 engine, a 4-speed transmission. One of the most powerful Corvettes you could buy. On this episode, we're gonna show the link between space and automobiles. The '50s and '60s was an incredible time for scientific progress. 
>> We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. 
>> But it also made its way into our everyday lives. From the way we travel, to architecture, even the way we dress. But most importantly for us, the Space Age influenced the automobile through technology, design, and speed. We're on our way now to Edwards Air Force Base, and we're gonna talk to a man who knows a lot about what it takes to go fast. I mean really fast. [lively music] 
>> Jay. [laughs] 
>> Hey, how you doing? 
>> Where'd you steal this thing? 
>> Isn't it cool? 
>> [laughs] 
>> It's Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, world-renowned astrophysicist. You know, this guy's won numerous awards, but to me, the coolest thing is he's brought astrophysics to the average person. He explains space better than anybody I've ever met. Is this what you came in? Did you break down? 
>> Yeah, I-
- [laughs] Yeah, you know, just cars are not good enough for me. 
>> Yeah. 
>> You know, the SR-71. 
>> This plane is actually quite old, isn't it? 
>> Yeah, well, I think it dates back from the '50s, early '60s. 
>> The SR-71 was essentially a spy plane that was designed to operate at high speeds and altitudes, making it almost invisible. And in its 25 years of service, an estimated 4,000 missiles were fired at it, and not a single one hit its target. 
>> What intrigues me about the SR-71 is they had to design it to be most efficient at the Mach 3 speeds it was hitting. 
>> Right. 
>> And at Mach 3, air is going rapidly over the skin of the plane. 
>> Right. 
>> And there's friction, there are shock waves transmitting energy in the form of heat, blowing air on top of it. 
>> So is the plane hotter than the air? 
>> So here's what happens. Here's air. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you're moving rapidly through it, you rapidly compress the air. 
>> Right. 
>> That will raise the temperature of the air. 
>> I see, I got you, I got you. 
>> That's what's happening. If the air just slowly goes out of your way as you go through it-
- 
>> Okay. 
>> When you walk through the air-
- 
>> Right. 
>> You're not-
- 
>> And is that how you walk through the air like that? Is that how you-
- When you're alone and there's nobody around, is that how you walk through the air? 
>> When I'm not going fast through the air-
- 
>> Right, right, okay. And I'm not passing judgment. That's fine with me. 
>> Well, the air parts for me. 
>> The air parts for you. 
>> Yes, yes, okay. So the cool thing about this is you fill it with fuel... 
>> Right. 
>> But on the ground, the fuel would just drip. Why? Because the seals of the plane are not yet closed. 
>> Well they need heat to close. 
>> Yes! Yes. So the plane is designed to exist at a much higher temperature when it's going Mach 2, Mach 3. Then the heat gets transmitted to the fuselage, the fuselage expands, all the seals close-
- 
>> Right. 
>> And now you've got a mean fighting machine. 
>> Let's go inside. 
>> Yeah. Love me some airplane museums. 
>> Wow, a lot of history here. Now the cool part is, this is stuff most folks don't usually get to see. But the people at Edwards have opened up a few doors for us, and we're gonna take a look at the history of speed. That's the one that broke the sound barrier. 
>> Right. You can see the design is very different from all of those, sort of, World War II airplanes that have rounded noses. 
>> The aerodynamic design of this plane not only helped Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier, it also influenced car design and technology forever. 
>> Here we got the engine that was actually in the X-15. 
>> So it went at 249,000 feet. So they were essentially astronauts, weren't they? 
>> Yeah, essentially, and all the early generations of astronauts you had, you know, flight time in this. 
>> Right. So did you ever want to be an astronaut? 
>> No, I never did. I knew early on that I loved astrophysics. So, the large-scale universe. And there was NASA going into, like, low Earth orbit. 
>> Right. 
>> And maybe to the Moon and back, but to me, that was such a small part of the universe at large, that, to me, that wasn't really going into space. 
>> Yeah. See, I knew I wanted to be an astronaut. I flew with the Blue Angels once. 
>> Oh, okay. 
>> And you realize these guys are smarter than you, can do math better than you, can do more push-ups than you-
- 
>> [laughs] Push-ups. 
>> Uh-
- 
>> Okay, but that's not why I didn't--I wasn't-
- 
>> I'm sure that's why-
- I'm sure could have passed the physical when you walked in like this. I'm sure that would have-
- When you split the air like this... Okay, I like museums as much as the next guy, but you know, I think it's time to meet the real deal. 
>> Hello. 
>> Hi. 
>> Hello, hello. 
>> Madam Secretary. 
>> Hello there. 
>> It's a pleasure. Neil Tyson. 
>> Debbie James, so nice to meet you, Neil. 
>> Deborah Lee James is the 23rd Secretary of the Air Force, and only the second woman to hold this position. She oversees over 600,000 airmen and women, as well as the Air Force's annual budget of $139 billion. 
>> Welcome to Edwards and welcome to the most advanced aircraft in our inventory, the F-22. 
>> We'll be the judge of that. [laughter] 
>> The F-22 Raptor is the most intelligent jet fighter in the world. It's loud, incredibly intimidating, and has a cruising speed of just over 1,200 miles an hour. And if its design looks familiar, that's because most super cars, hyper cars, whatever you want to call them, all take influence from this aircraft. And what is the flying speed? 
>> So it's a Mach 2 class airplane, which means it can go approximately twice the speed of sound. The airplane is capable of going much faster than that, but there's limitations as far as actually skin temperature. Airplane gets too hot if it goes too fast. 
>> First rule of combat, don't vaporize your pilot. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Right. They hate it when you do that. 
>> They hate every time it happens. 
>> The other cool thing about this aircraft is it's highly stealthy, which means it's nearly invisible to what could be enemy radar. 
>> Now where does it fire from? Is this a bomber, primarily? 
>> This is primarily an air-to-air fighter with an air-to-ground role. You can see, this is the doors for one of the side weapon bays. 
>> Okay. 
>> There's a total of two side weapon bays, which can fit one missile each. Two underwing bays, which can fit three missiles each. 
>> The engines are way back here. How many cubic feet of air goes through there every minute? Do you know? 
>> Just say a bajillion. 
>> A bajillion? 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> A lot. 
>> Are there manual controls to any of this, or is it all electronic? 
>> It's all electronic. 
>> Okay. 
>> Will the computer ever judge that the pilot's crazy? We're not doing that--[laughs] We're not following that instruction. 
>> Yes, it's self-
- [booming] 
>> [screams] [laughter] 
>> That's a sonic boom. 
>> That was a big sonic boom. Okay-
- 
>> That was a standard sonic boom. [laughter] 
>> Okay, now you've seen just how brave I am. Let's head to the test stand, where we can see this engine in action. Looks a lot bigger up close. 
>> And Jay and Neil, I want to introduce you to Triggs from Pratt & Whitney. 
>> Mike Triggs, nice to meet you, Jay. 
>> Triggs, as in trigonometry? 
>> Oh, yes, sir. 
>> The plural of trigonometry. 
>> Yes sir, heard that many times. Welcome, welcome, nice to meet you. 
>> What would this be in automotive horsepower? I know you measure differently. 
>> It's hard to convert. I'm gonna say on the order of 100,000. Two of these side by side... 
>> 100,000 horsepower? 
>> Pushing the raptor. It's almost a cruise ship pushing an airplane through the sky. You guys wanna run it? 
>> Yeah, let's run it. 
>> Let's do it. 
>> We'll go inside, and then we'll crank it up. If you're standing close proximity to the engine when it's up at maximum power, it's putting so much acoustic energy into the air that you can feel it in your internal organs. 
>> Yeah. And believe me, nobody wants melted organs. Fortunately, there's a special insulated building where my organs will be just fine. 
>> All right, Jay. 
>> Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor. 
>> [laughs] Let's see what you got. 
>> Let's see, let's bring it up. Okay, now, there we go. 
>> All right. 
>> Now it's starting to sound-
- here we go. 
>> Now we're talking. 
>> Now we're talking. Yeah, 25, 30. 
>> More, more, more. [engine roaring] 
>> Whoo! 
>> There it is, there it is. 
>> Look at that. Hey, not my fuel. Yeah--yes, it is, we're paying for this fuel. Let me bring it all the way back. What is that, about 1,000 gallons of gas we blew out of that thing? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Whoo-hoo! We gotta get one of these. [laughter] Okay, that was pretty cool, but I think it's time to give the good doctor a dramatic demonstration of exactly what we're talking about. Can we use the runway to take him for a ride? You wanna go for a ride in the jet car? That sounds like a yes. 
>> [mouthing silently] 
>> Coming up... Up to 165. Can Neil deGrasse Tyson handle the high speeds of the jet car? [window thuds] Lost a window. Hi, most people know me for my award-winning comedy, but I also used to be a doctor. It's just like most people know State Farm for home and auto insurance. We've also won five J.D.

>> We've seen some amazing jets, but those are ones that go through the air. [engine roaring] How about a jet that only goes on the ground? Now have you ever been in a truly homemade car? 
>> Never. 
>> Well you're gonna come for a ride in the Leno. I'm gonna take Neil deGrasse Tyson out in my car, the EcoJet. Yeah. 
>> This is the Leno. 
>> Well, it's not the Leno, but we call it the EcoJet. But it uses a jet engine that had belonged to a big attack helicopter. 
>> You made a car with a jet engine? 
>> This was something I really wanted to do. With the help of General Motors and Honeywell, we built a jet car that runs on renewable energy. Oh, and it goes pretty fast, too. [engines roaring] What's the fastest you've ever-
- [engine roars] We are gonna go faster than that guy. I'm coming for you! Your ass is mine! [laughter] 
>> And why is it called Eco? 'Cause this doesn't look very eco to me. 
>> Well actually, it's called Eco 'cause when we built this, we built it to run on biofuel. 
>> So it's got a jet engine, where's the exhaust? 
>> This is a shaft driven, you understand? 
>> Okay. 
>> It turns a shaft, which goes to the transmission, which means it's at the rear, here. And then your exhaust heat comes out the top. In the helicopter-
- 
>> It would've been way cooler if flames came out the back of the car, I'm just saying. 
>> Well, yeah, I'm not trying to scare children. We're trying to make a transportation vehicle here. 
>> All right, I'm ready to take a spin. 
>> Let's do it. 
>> All right. [horn honks] Let's do it! [intense music] Show me what you got! Whoo! [window thuds] Lost a window. [engine roaring] [window thuds] Oh, note to self... [window thuds] Fix that driver's side window. 
>> You're aerodynamic enough. Doesn't matter. Whoo! 
>> It's 160. Actually 165. Well we got up to 165. We had a window blow out at 130. Well that--that's gonna happen. 
>> [laughs] 
>> But that's a-
- 
>> Stuff happens. 
>> Yeah, stuff happens. Stuff happens! I mean, we can go a lot faster, but I thought that was enough. We don't want to kill the good doctor. 
>> [laughs] I want a bumper sticker, too, that says My Other Car is a Jet Engine. 
>> Yeah, my other car is a jet engine, I want-
- We're gonna make a car guy out of him yet. Well now we're gonna go over to what many consider the unlikely birthplace of the Space Age, the Columbia Memorial Space Center in Downey, California. You'll see how space travel influenced Space Age style. It really touched all aspects of our lives, from fashion, futuristic electronics, mod design, home appliances, even food. 
>> Space Food Sticks, they're compact, nutritious, high energy food. 
>> The Space Age really started in the '50s, right after World War II, because jet planes had come in, cars had all kinds of wild fins and wild Jet Age styling. Oh, here. Here you go. Here's a perfect example of what I'm talking about. [funky rock music] [cash register bell rings] This is a 1961 Pontiac Bonneville. This is Charles Phoenix. Charles, how are you, my friend? 
>> How you doing, Jay? 
>> Good to see you. Now Charles is the man when it comes to the 1950s and '60s Americana. He's a pop culture humorist and a classic car collector as well. And there's no one I know who appreciates Space Age style more than this guy. 
>> I love everything to do with astronauts going to Mars, going to the Moon and this. Every time I see this, I practically feel like I have to run over and give it a big hug. 
>> Well, then-
- 
>> I mean, it feels like an old friend, don't you think? 
>> Yeah, it does feel like an old friend. There you go. All right. I love the command module, and you know, this really goes perfectly with it. I like a lot of the Space Age goo-gahs on this thing. You know, the little gunsight looking--are these to aid parking, is that the idea? 
>> You know what? I think they're just supposed to help guide your way no matter where you're going. 
>> Yeah. You can see the rocket theme. You see it there? Where it turns into Bonneville, here, and then this looks like the thrusters from a jet, coming out the back. And this has kind of a jet thing, too. And then, you still have the vestiges of a tailfin, here. Just a--just a little bit. 
>> That's kind of what I call a finette. 
>> both: A finette. 
>> Yes, yes. 
>> Why not? I also love the fact they color coordinated everything back then. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> It was like they were selling fashion, you know? 
>> As you can see, very important. Notice how I am not-
- Well, I guess I am color coordinated. Kinda. 
>> You ready to take it for a roll? 
>> Let's take it for a roll. 
>> Here's the keys. 
>> Let's do it. 
>> The original keys, too. 
>> Cool. [light music] [engine turns over] 
>> [Music] Da da da da da [Music] [Music] Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo [Music] 
>> Jay, the Space Age is like the mood is up, the standard of living is flying high, and prosperity rules. 
>> See, you were lucky. You grew up here. When you're living in Massachusetts, and you're sitting in math class and it's freezing, and you have a copy of Hot Rod Magazine under your math book-
- Everything was happening in Downey, Hermosa, Redondo. There was surfing, there was the hot rods, the Beach Boys, I mean, everything was here. 
>> You know, Southern California is a cultural juggernaut. Downey, they call it The Cradle of the Cosmic Age. 
>> You know, just driving around Southern California, there's all sorts of little cues to the Space Age. Take a look. 
>> Okay, Jay. Hold on, this is major. This is real, this is deep. This is the oldest McDonald's on the planet. 
>> Wow. When I worked at McDonald's, their slogan was, Where a family of four can have lunch for under a dollar. There's Speedee Hamburger. 
>> Even the name, it's all about speed. The Space Age. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> Everything is going fast. This one was built in 1953. And as you can see, it is a masterpiece of mid-century modernity. 
>> It was kinda Space Age with the Golden Arch like that. 
>> That rocket launcher roofline, I love. And don't you love the red and white stripes? It's a cultural juggernaut. Paris has the Eiffel Tower. Pisa has the Leaning Tower of. 
>> Right. 
>> And Downey has the oldest McDonald's on the planet. 
>> And you can't get a hamburger at the Eiffel Tower. 
>> You cannot get a hamburger there. I love all of the design of the era, I mean, it was the Tomorrowland era. 
>> I remember Space Age kitchen. 
>> Oh, yeah, no, I love atomic kitchens. 
>> Every woman is fascinated by Frigidaire's Kitchen of Tomorrow. 
>> Right now, the question before the house is: What's cooking, and when do we eat? 
>> Wait till you see this bowling alley sign, Jay. 
>> Okay. 
>> From about 1960, it is the epitome of Space Age style. Oh, there it is. I see it. [gasps] Oh, God! I mean, what makes this sign really unique, I mean, besides the B-O-W-L, Bowl, for bowling alley, letters that go up and down like they're dancing... 
>> Right, right. 
>> Are not one, not two, three, four, five, six, seven starbursts. 
>> Right. 
>> I mean, this sign is sparkling. It's a masterpiece! 
>> Looks like the Jetsons would bowl there. 
>> Exactly. [light music] So right now, we are on our way to Bob's Big Boy Broiler. 
>> Right. 
>> In Downey. 
>> Okay. 
>> Which is a juggernaut of a landmark. 
>> Another jugger--that's a lot of juggernauts here. 
>> Well, I'm just saying. You know, I am really passionate about this stuff. Well here we are, Jay, the largest carhop restaurant built in California, ever. 
>> Really? 
>> And--yeah, in its day, it was the place to see and be seen-
- 
>> Yeah. 
>> In your hot rod, custom or classic cars. And there is a car show here tonight. 
>> Actually, it's not a car show, it's just a typical night at Bob's Big Boy. 
>> Yeah, that's it. It's a typical night. Everybody drives vintage cars around here. And I love it. Doesn't get more authentic than this. Well it really wouldn't be the true experience without being served by a carhop. Here they are. 
>> Oh, here we are. 
>> Here we go. 
>> Wow. 
>> Oh, cool, look at that. 
>> And here's your Big Boy. 
>> Enjoy, boys. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Why thank you very much. 
>> Mmm. 
>> This is the America I know. 
>> This is Space Age Americana right here. A triple hamburger in a classic car. Bob's Big Boy Broiler. 
>> Doesn't get any better than this. 
>> Cheers, Jay. 
>> Coming up... 
>> Ohh. Clever. 
>> Tim Allen shows off his car nerd knowledge. 
>> '72 is correct. And reveals a little too much about himself. Bondage, spanking. 
>> Oh, very into that. MOVING? THAT'S HARDER NOW BECAUSE OF PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS. BUT YOU'RE STILL MOVED BY MOMENTS LIKE THIS. DON'T LET PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS TAKE THEM AWAY.

[funky music] 
>> It's time for another episode of... Welcome to another episode of Stump a Car Nerd. This is where we take a knowledgeable car enthusiast, we blindfold them, and they have to guess what vehicle they're in. Today we're talking with Timothy Allen, is it? 
>> What are you, my mother? Nobody calls me Timothy. 
>> Tim is an old buddy of mine. Is that what it is? You pushing me? Oh yeah? He's been on the show a couple of times now. You'll always be the Tool Man, Allen. 
>> You look like my wife in that car. 
>> Actually, he played an astronaut in the movies, so there is a tie-in here. 
>> [laughs] 
>> Let's put this blindfold on. 
>> This is--shades of grey. And I get no pants, right? 
>> All right, go ahead, you know. 
>> Oh, this is creepy. 
>> Okay, there we go. 
>> Jay! 
>> Okay, open the door. 
>> I can smell it. Now, wait, wait, which way are we going? All right. 
>> Okay. 
>> I don't wanna bang into [bleep]. 
>> This is a 1970 Mazda Cosmo, updated with a little later engine. This engine puts out about 225 horsepower, but it's still a Wankel. 
>> Where's--I need-
- where's the rearview mirror? 
>> I chose this car 'cause I'm pretty sure I'm gonna stump Tim. 
>> Ohh. Clever. 
>> Let's put you in the vehicle. 
>> So we're gonna drive blindfolded. There's a good idea. 
>> Yeah, yeah, come on over here. 
>> It's California, what difference does it make? 
>> Watch your head. 
>> Oh. 
>> Watch your head. 
>> Ow! 
>> All right, ready to start it up? [engine turns over] That's a major clue. 
>> Well, the major clue is this. 
>> Right. 
>> Have you ever eaten anything blindfolded? 
>> Yeah, you can't tell an apple from a potato. 
>> You can't-
- but it's [bleep] weird. 
>> Have you ever eaten a blindfold? That's the tough one. 
>> [laughs] 
>> Yeah, I mean, that's really hard. 
>> Tastes like an apple. 
>> Oh, yeah. [lively rock music] 
>> It's a multi-cam four cylinder. [buzzer blares] 
>> No, not a multi-cam four cylinder. 
>> It's a quick thing, and it's not very new. [bell dings] It's Japanese. [bell dings] 
>> It is Japanese. 
>> Yes. 
>> What made you say Japanese? 
>> The mirror up front, and the fact that it's a right-hand drive. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I'm honing in on Isuzu and Mazda. 
>> Feel free to hone in on whoever you like. 
>> [laughs] [engine revs] I gotta say, this is a Wankel engine. 
>> It is a Wankel engine. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Are you ready to make a guess? [drum roll] 
>> I gotta go with the Mazda. [shimmering tones] 
>> That's right, it's a Mazda Cosmo. 
>> [screams] God, it's bright! 
>> There you go. 
>> Is this yours? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Can I have it? 
>> Isn't it smooth? It just revs forever, doesn't it? 
>> Forever. 
>> We have another vehicle. Let's put on the blindfold. 
>> This is so much fun. I can't believe I'm doing this. But I'm sure the money will be rolling in. 
>> All righty, let's turn around. 
>> Am I--am I turned around? 
>> This is a 1959 Oldsmobile 88. [cash register bell rings] It has a 315 horsepower rocket V8 engine, a four-barrel carburetor. 
>> Is it pricey? Can I touch the thing, or is it-
- 
>> You can touch it, yes. And has all kinds of spaceship-like details. This is perfect for the mid-century man... 
>> Definitely not European. 
>> Who dreams of being an astronaut. You're not a young man anymore. 
>> [laughs] Why is there marijuana in here? [engine turns over] Safety first. Put on the seatbelt. 
>> Oh, I've got mine on. That's the only one we need to worry about. 
>> [laughs] [upbeat music] 
>> It's a GM product. It's a V8. [bell dings] It's not shifting like a Ford. [bell dings] 
>> What makes you think it's not shifting like a Ford? 
>> Ford's a little crispy. It had better transmissions in this era. This is late '50s. [bell dings] 
>> Does it feel higher end or lower end? 
>> It feels higher end than Chevy, judging by the dashboard. 
>> Okay. 
>> And it's got a vent window. A lot of bull[bleep] going on. The curves and [bleep]. A lot of body, a lot of style. Custom made stuff. Doesn't come in Chevys. 
>> How about the size? Look, see, I can't punch you in the face. 
>> You could if you really wanted to. 
>> I do really want to. 
>> All right, well-
- 
>> Believe me, I want to more than anything. [laughter] You ready to make a guess? What do you got? 
>> Let's say... [drum roll] '58 Oldsmobile 88. 
>> Good! '59 Oldsmobile 88. 
>> Get out! 
>> Yeah, that's what it is. [Music] Longer, leaner, lower [Music] 
>> [laughs] 
>> You've done well. You've guessed both cars. There's one left. 
>> All right, here we go. 
>> Let's put this on. 
>> Let's get this going, 'cause CNBC's got financial data to give people. 
>> Let's open the door. All right, come on in here. Here we go. This is a 1972 Citroen SM. It's French, it's elegant, and even though this car is over 40 years old, it still looks like the future today. 
>> Ohh. Ohh. That is peculiar. Oh, big door. Is there another door back here? 
>> both: No. 
>> So it's a two-door. 
>> Only two doors. 
>> Okay. [engine turns over] [rock music] Is it considered a sports model in its day? 
>> Sporty. Not a sports car, per se. 
>> Is it front drive? [bell dings] 
>> Front-wheel drive. 
>> All right, now I got it down to Citroen, Peugeot-
- 
>> What made you think it's French? 
>> Um, seat bolsters, the sound of the motor, these weird door handles. But these--definitely think these--the seat--there's too many seat mechanisms. 
>> Yeah. What era do you think this car is? 
>> Oh, [bleep]. 
>> No, that's wrong. 
>> [laughs] Oh, God. 
>> What era would you say? 
>> Late '60s, early '70s. 
>> Closer to which? 
>> Early '70s. 
>> Early '70s, good. And what kind of motor you think it is? 
>> Six cylinder of some sort, but it's-
- 
>> Six cylinder. What do you think, straight six? V6? 
>> No, it's gotta be V6. It revs pretty well. It has a nice-
- 
>> Okay. 
>> It has a nice sound to it when it gets up there. 
>> All right, so, you ready to make a guess? 
>> And I'm gonna go Citroen. 
>> Citroen is correct. 
>> Whoa! 
>> What year would you say it is? [bell dings] 
>> '72 is correct. What model do you think? 
>> Um-
- 
>> I'll give you a clue. Uh, bondage, spanking-
- 
>> Oh, very into that. 
>> Yeah, okay. The letters are an abbreviation for what many, but not you, would consider deviant behavior. 
>> [laughs] SM. 
>> SM, now--so give me the whole thing. It's a what? 
>> A 1972 Citroen SM. 
>> Yes! That is correct! You may remove the blindfold. 
>> Yes. 
>> That's very good. Tim, three for three. Very good. We'll just step on the gas and pull away. [laughs] Coming up... We'll meet the incredible team behind the most expensive vehicle ever made. 
>> Bam, you hit the side of a rock and fall over. The mission's over.

>> The car I'm driving right now is called the Rocket. It was designed back in the early '90s by Gordon Murray, the famous designer, responsible for so many F1 wins, and of course, the iconic McLaren F1, one of the greatest cars of the 20th century. Gordon Murray's design was all about power-to-weight ratio. This car has a Yamaha motorcycle Genesis engine, that makes 147 horsepower, but only weighs 775 pounds. And the best part is... [engine roars] It's street legal! What does it have to do with the Space Age? Well, it's called the Rocket because it goes like a rocket. [engine roars] Right now, we're on our way to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is just 15 miles from my garage. Home to incredible robotics, powerful telescopes, and of course, the $2.5 billion Mars Rover, and the crew that built it. Dr. Elachi, how are you, sir? 
>> Hi, Jay. How are you doing? 
>> Oh, what an honor this is. 
>> Welcome to JPL. 
>> This is where it all happens. I mean, this goes back to the very beginning of space flight in America, this whole complex, doesn't it? 
>> Yeah, yeah. [dramatic music] 
>> Wow. How cool is this? I had seen this room on television. I never thought I'd actually be standing in it. 
>> So as you look at this screen, as we speak, we have 22 spacecrafts in space, all across the solar system. This is Jim, who's in charge... 
>> Jim, how are you, sir? 
>> Very well, nice to meet you, Jay. 
>> You too. 
>> Jim is going to be giving you the detail. 
>> Doctor, thank you. 
>> Take care. 
>> I'll see you, Charles. 
>> Someone made the analogy this is like NASA's steering wheel. 
>> I think you could say that. 
>> Yeah. 
>> For deep space missions. 
>> Right. 
>> And for Earth science missions as well. We operate many of the vehicles from this room in fact. 
>> That's the room you guys are in on August 5th--was it 2012? 
>> That's the date, that's right. 
>> When Curiosity landed. After a seven-month-long journey, the Mars Rover Curiosity made its final descent onto the planet Mars. And at $2.5 billion, it's by far the most expensive and advanced Rover yet. Landing this craft without flipping it, crashing it, or breaking it was the challenge. [cheers and applause] 
>> How emotional a moment was that? 
>> That was extremely emotional. I've been here for over 28 years and that was probably the most emotional evening of my life. 
>> Yeah, I mean, that's such an amazing thing to me, to have so much time and energy invested in one critical little moment. 
>> With the world watching. 
>> Yeah. 
>> We had over 50 million Americans watching us just on our web servers in that room that night. 
>> Yeah, yeah, wow. 
>> That's a lot of pressure for us geeks and nerds, if you will. 
>> Yeah, I'd love to have 50 million Americans watching. 
>> Right? 
>> Well now you're gonna see the most expensive vehicle on the planet. [knocking] And the amazing thing is, it's housed in an ordinary garage. Literally. Just like a garage you'd have at home. 
>> Hi, Jay. 
>> John, how are you? 
>> Good, how you doing? Welcome to the Mars Yard. 
>> Thank you, thank you. And this is the Mars Rover, isn't it? 
>> This is it. This is what we call the VSTB, Vehicle Systems Test Bed, and it basically is the entire Rover. 
>> And you're the driver, correct? 
>> I am one of the drivers, yes. 
>> Okay. 
>> We have a whole team. We build command sequences ahead of time that tell it everything we want to do for the day. And then it goes about its business all by itself. And when it's done, it says, Okay, here's what happened. 
>> This thing doesn't just roll around all day. In fact, as we speak, it's searching for evidence of ancient life and water on Mars. It can actually analyze gases and organics all by itself and then send that data back to Earth. Just an amazing feat of engineering. Oh, and listen to this, it also takes selfies. [camera shutter clicking] Is there technology here filtering down to automobiles? 
>> There are image processing algorithms and things that are on here to look for hazards and things like that that can be adapted and used. We actually had one of our colleagues work on the self-driving car. 
>> Can we drive this one? Is that possible? 
>> Um, the problem with driving this one is you have to build the command sequences the same way we do for the Rover on Mars. 
>> Right. 
>> So we have a stripped down model over here. 
>> Oh, the stripped one, the base model. 
>> Exactly. So this is the Scarecrow. This is our mobility mock-up. I wanna introduce you to Gareth. 
>> Hey. 
>> He's gonna show you how to drive it. 
>> Gareth, how are you? 
>> Jay. Good, how are you? 
>> This is called Scarecrow, you said? 
>> This is called Scarecrow. 
>> Why is this Scarecrow? 
>> Because it doesn't have a brain. 
>> That's why they call me Scarecrow at the network. I had no idea. 
>> Well I'm gonna leave you in Gareth's capable hands. 
>> Okay, well thank you, thank you very much. Thank you. 
>> So let's start with something simple. The top button in the middle, there, says forward five meters. This is really the workhorse of our mobility testing in the Mars Yard. We do the vast majority of our testing with this especially before we do anything with VSTB. 
>> You know, for $2.5 billion, I expect a little more horsepower, maybe some leather interior. But that's okay. Let's pick up the pace here. This is a show about going fast. Stop. Wow. 
>> So we're gonna aim to put it over some rocks. So here you're gonna see the vehicle ascend this rock that we've placed in front of it. So you'll notice that one thing we try to do is when one side of the vehicle is going over a rock... 
>> Right. 
>> We don't want the whole vehicle to stop rolling. 
>> Right. 
>> So we have a differential on top of the vehicle and that makes sure that when one wheel goes up on one side, the other goes down. 
>> Okay, sure, it's a little bit slow, but incredibly efficient. And keep in mind, the real Rover is doing this right now, more than 249,000,000 miles away on Mars and in, believe me, far worse conditions. Well Gareth, thank you. It's fascinating. 
>> You're very welcome. 
>> So what if NASA made a production car? Would you buy it? Well, they're not quite there yet, but they have adapted the technology from the Mars Rover and made an Earth Rover car, called the Modular Robotic Vehicle. Pretty catchy, huh? The MRV, for short, is incredibly nimble and designed with urban driving in mind. It's completely electronic, allowing for remote control and even full autonomy. It has a top speed of 43 miles an hour and can hold a charge for 62 miles. But the coolest feature adapted from the Rover is its four independently actuated wheels, each with its own steering system, allowing them to rotate 180 degrees and sneak into some pretty tight parking spaces. However, you're probably more likely to see this thing on another planet, where there's always plenty of parking, there's really not that much trouble. I had a heart problem.

>> [Music] If you love classic cars [Music] [Music] Then Donald loves you [Music] [cash register bell rings] [bell dings] 
>> Well we are back once again with our automotive historian and appraiser, Donald Osborne. Donald, thank you, again. Tell us what these three cars have in common. 
>> Well, today we're celebrating the Space Age. And these are three examples of the Space Age in their time period. We've got the 1937 Panhard Dynamic. A 1961 Chrysler 300G. And a 1972 Citroen SM. 
>> Well let's start with the Dynamic. 
>> This car is pure Buck Rogers space futurism. This car was designed by Panhard to be as advanced as it possibly could be. Using all the lessons of aerodynamics seen on the earlier Chrysler Airflow, you see the waterfall grill and the fenders that are integrated into the body to manage the airflow. The covered wheels. And they also wanted to make sure that this car, in terms of being advanced as a driving experience, they eliminated the A pillar. So they put this piece of glass here. So you have almost total vision. 
>> Oh, I see. There you are. 
>> Isn't that astonishing? 
>> Yeah, fantastic. 
>> Hello, Jay! 
>> [with French accent] Allo. 
>> Let's go over to the Chrysler. 
>> Okay. 
>> Many people talk about what the first muscle cars were, and you can make a great argument for the Chrysler letter cars because they broke the performance barrier that had been held for decades by the great Duesenberg SJ. 
>> They were really fast. This has a 413 engine, with two four-barrel carburetors. and it makes 375 horsepower, which was a lot of horsepower in 1961. 
>> A big, heavy car, but fast. 
>> Yeah. And this is a car, when it came out, they used to think they were sort of ugly. They were so far-out looking, in terms of Space Age styling. I mean, they really looked like rockets coming out the back. And now they're just so classically American. 
>> Now let's go to one of my absolutely favorite cars on the entire planet, the Citroen SM. The Citroen SM is a marriage of this wonderful French bodywork engineering chassis, and a Maserati V6 engine. 
>> You know, the one thing about Citroen, they always look like the future, because it doesn't look like any other car. It looks like something that would come around the turn of the next century. Let's show people what it's like under the hood. This is what really intimidated American mechanics back in the day. What you have here are these spheres, which are just brilliant. They're filled with fluid on one side and there's nitrogen on the other. And it's a thick rubber. And when the compressor works, the rubber pushes the fluid, and it raises the car up and down. I mean, it's a brilliant system. There's no springs, it's quiet. It does look intimidating, but it's really not. It's just a different way of doing things. All right, so we have three choices here. Which one of these will appreciate the most in the next five years? Hmm. Let's see what The Donald has to say. This and more, after a brief message from our sponsors.

>> And we're back with Donald Osborne. with Donald Osborne. [bell dings] All right, Donald, which of these vehicles has appreciated the most? 
>> First of all, starting with the Dynamic, a car like this sold a few years ago for about $76,000. And today you can probably get one for about $78,000. [bell dings] So a bit of appreciation because they are interesting objects. 
>> Right. 
>> The Chrysler, about five years ago, one of these would cost about $95,000. Today, it would be about $92,000. It suffered a bit from the general softening of the market for big, 1950s American cars. 
>> But if you're buying cars by the pound, that's still the best deal. 
>> Absolutely. Five years ago, a really nice Citroen SM might have cost you $40,000. Today, a good one will cost [bell dings] 
>> It is the Citroen. [imitating French laugh] [victorious organ music] 
>> The best of France and Italy. [upbeat music] 
>> I'm real excited, 'cause one of my favorite customizers is coming by the garage today. His name is Gene Winfield. Legendary hot rodder, custom car builder. Oh, by the way, Gene is 89 years old. How cool is that? He's bringing one of my favorite cars. my favorite cars. It's called the Reactor. It's called the Reactor. Now I've never seen Now I've never seen this car in person, this car in person, but when I was a kid, but when I was a kid, I had pictures of it on my wall. Here he comes now. Hey, Gene, how you doing? 
>> Great, Jay. How you been? 
>> It looks fantastic. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Explain to people what we have here. 
>> This is a turbocharge Corvair. 
>> Right. 
>> Front-wheel drive. 
>> Right. 
>> On a Citroen chassis. 
>> Tell me where your styling ideas come from. Did it come from NASA? Just out of your head? 
>> No, well partly out of my head, and then I got ahold of a designer, Ben Delphia. 
>> Right. 
>> So he did the final design for me. 
>> And, of course, the engineering is really amazing. Nobody was doing a front-wheel drive hot rod. This is about the only one at the time, isn't it? 
>> For sure, the only one. 
>> Can we open the hood? 
>> Yeah, sure. 
>> Oh, look at that. Well, and I see all the Citroen. You even have a Corvair generator from the period. 
>> Yes, I made the adapter myself to couple up the Corvair engine to the Citroen transaxle. 
>> Tell me about the--the-
- well it's not a steering wheel, is it? Steering-
- 
>> No, it's a steering apparatus. 
>> Yeah. 
>> It's called a twist-wrist steering. 
>> Right. 
>> See, so you actually turn it and you can turn these handles. 
>> Oh, I got you. 
>> Like that. 
>> And that's the original color, did you ever change the color? 
>> No, I repainted a couple of times throughout the years, but it's always been a green metal flake. 
>> Yeah, I remember there's a picture of Shatner leaning up against this. 
>> That's right. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> That's right. 
>> Can we take it out for a ride? 
>> Yeah, sure. 
>> Well that'd be cool. 
>> Sure, you bet. 
>> Let's do it. [engine turns over] Put that top down. Let's peel out of here. 
>> All right. Here we go. [engine roaring] [surf rock music] 
>> The Reactor looks like it should go about 1,000 miles an hour. Kinda like Gene himself. This guy never slows down. What's the most fun part? Designing it? Building it? Driving it? 
>> Building it, building it. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> Yeah, building it was the most fun part. 
>> People don't realize how many man hours go into something like this, huh? What are you looking at here? About 3,000 man hours? Something like that? 
>> Yeah. [engine rumbles] 
>> You know, sometimes, looking cool isn't always practical. [coughs] Or healthy. 
>> Whoo. [laughs] 
>> A little smoky inside. 
>> You--you're a good sport. 
>> No, no. You know, if you had told me 50 years ago I'd get asphyxiated with Gene Winfield in the car I dreamed about when I was 15 years old, it's pretty amazing. 
>> Well, thank you. 
>> Yeah, but it really is. Doesn't get any cooler than that. So why is space so important to the automobile? 
>> Hold on. This is major. This is deep. 
>> Well, it revolutionized styling... This looks like the thrusters from a jet, coming out the back. Modernized technology... 
>> Now you've got a mean, fighting machine. 
>> And helped influence some of the most expensive and advanced machinery in the world. [w
