 I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
 WHEN ZION WILLIAMSON WENT OUT,
 HE SUCKED THE A
 TOURNAMENT.
 FOUR TEAMS WITHOUT ANY STARS.
 TWO FOOTBALL SCHOOLS.
 VIRGINIA HAS NO NATIONAL

 MICHIGAN STATE THERE FOR A LONG

 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

 HE'S NOT KEVIN DURANT.

 I'M NOT READY TO LOOK AT GOLDEN

 THEY BEAT BACK THE CELTICS, THE

 HERE'S A QUOTE FROM THEO
 EPSTEIN, WHO I KNOW YOU THINK IS
 A GREAT EXECUTIVE.
 FROM DECEMBER, QUOTE, THIS YEAR
 IS A RECKONING.
 I FEEL WE UNDERPERFORMED.
 JUDGE US ON HOW WE PLAY NEXT
 YEAR.
 THIS IS NEXT YEAR.
 MIKE: WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO YOU?
 TONY: I HAD RICHIE JUSTICE ON
 THE PODCAST AND HE BELIEVES JOE
 MADDON IS ON A HOT SEAT, THAT
 THERE WAS A CULT OF PERSONALITY
 THAT GREW UP AROUND JOE MADDON,
 AND THAT HE DIDN'T GIVE TIME TO

 THE MANAGER SAYS HE'LL KEEP HIM
 IN THE LINEUP WHEN HE CAN.
 OF IS THE ROOKIE MANAGER TO
 STANDBY HIS SLUGGER?
 TONY: NO ONE'S HEARD OF THIS
 MANAGER.
 WE'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF GAMES IN
 BALTIMORE.
 THEY'RE NOT A HYPOCRITICAL
 CROWD.
 THIS MAY BE OVER.
 FOR ALL THE MONEY HE--
 MIKE: $23 MILLION A YEAR FOR THE
 NEXT FOUR YEARS, INCLUDING THIS
 ONE.
 TONY: YOU HAVE TO EAT SOME OF
 THAT, MOST OF THAT, BUT IT
 BECOMES AFTER A WHILE A MENTAL
 HEALTH ISSUE.
 YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS GUY OUT
 OF THERE.
 WHEN YOU'RE CHEERING PITCH
 HITTERS -- THIS IS A BAD
 CIRCUMSTANCE.

 HOMERS, 138 R.B.I.'S.

 THE CUBS CHANGED A HITTING A
 PITCHING COACH AND --
 TONY: CHANGED EVERYBODY.
 MIKE: NOW HE'S FORGOT HOW TO
 HIT?
 TONY: I DON'T KNOW IF HE FORGOT
 HOW TO HIT.
 I SAY YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE
 THAT, IN A CITY LIKE BALTIMORE,
 WHICH IS NOT PHILADELPHIA, AND
 IT MAY BE BEST FOR CHRIS DAVIS
 TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO PLAY.
 MIKE: YEAH.
 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO EAT.
 TONY: GOT TO EAT MOST OF IT.
 THERE'S A TANTALIZING POSSIBLY
 IN THE WIND THAT YOUNG GUNS
 PATRICK MAHOMES AND JOSH ALLEN
 MAY HAVE A THROWING CONTEST TO
 TOSEE WHO HAS THE LONGER ARM.
 MAHOMES SAID NO ONE THAT I'VE
 THANN HAS THROWN A BALL FARTHER■
 I'VE NEVER SEEN JOSH IN PERSON,
 BUT MAYBE NEXT OFF-SEASON WE CAN
 SET SOMETHING UP.
 IT'S GOING TO TAKE 85 YARDS TO
 WIN.

 YOU'VE EVER SEEN IS JOHN ELWAY.
 MIKE: YES.
 TONY: I WOULD SAY JEFF GEORGE.
 I USED TO WATCH■X■X■X■
 HE WAS TOL WARMUPS WHAT
 STEPH CURRY IS TO BASKETBALL

 TONY: A ANALOGY, RORY MCILROY
 CAN DRIVE THE BALL 340 YARDS,
 BUT THE GUY IN THE LONG DRIVE
 CONTEST CAN DRIVE IT 400 YARDS,
 BUT THEG■G■.■.■■■G/.■■■.■.■■■■■■
 LONGER.
 MIKE: MAHOMES CAN PLAY AND A GUY
 WITH A LONG DRIVE.
 I THINK NO ONE PROBABLY IN THE
 LEAGUE CAN THROW IT AS FAR AS
 PATRICK MAHOMES.
 TONY: YOU CAN FIND A GUY ON A
 STREET CORNER WHO CAN THROW IT A
 HUNDRED.
 I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S A
 QUARTERBACK, BUT HE CAN THROW IT
 A HUNDRED.
 MIKE: HOW FAR COULD GRONK THROW
 IT?
 TONY: HE WOULD EAT THE FOOTBALL.
 LET'S TAKEq A BREAK.
 BUT COMING UP ON THE EVE OF THE
 FINAL FOUR IS ANYONE SURPRISEDAL
 COACHING AT AUBURN?
 MIKE: AND REGGIE MILLER SAYS
 HE'S SEEN THE BEST PRACTICE HE'S
 EVER SEEN.
  I switched to Verizon because
           I was tired   of having my calls dropped.
     I had friends that were            next to me
     and they weren't having    these issues and they said
   like, "You need to switch!"
        And then I'd heard   that I could get Apple Music
        if I switched over       and I said, "BOOM!"
  Music is very important to me.
           I come from         the techno era,
    but I'm hip-hop at heart.
 The best network is even better
      with more music on us.
         Get Apple Music     included with Unlimited.
  Plus save big when you switch.
         Only on Verizon.

 OUR GREAT FRIEND JAY BILAS JOINS
 US WITH HIS EXPENSIVE NEW TIE WE
 HEARD ABOUT OFF AIR.
 AUBURN LOST A PLAYER AND STILL
 BEAT KENTUCKY.
 IS THIS A ONE-SHOT DEAL OR CAN
 THEY SUSTAIN THAT WITHOUT HIM?
 ■k HIM THEY STILL
 WOUND UP WINNING THE GAME, BUT
 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERFECT
 DEFENDER TO PUT ON DEANDRE
 HUNTER OF VIRGINIA, A LOTTERY
 PICK, THE MOST DIFFICULT TO
 DEFEND.
 MIKE: IT'S LOSING A LOT.
 VIRGINIA, JAY, AS YOU KNOW, IS
 VERY DELIBERATE.
 AUBURN IS UP-TEMPO TO SAY THE
 LEAST.
 DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
 WHEN IT COMES TO TEMPO AND COULD
 YOU SEE ONE OF THOSE TEAMS
 FORCING ITS WILL ON THE OTHER?
 JAY: YEAH.
 I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY,
 MICHAEL, TO BE VIRGINIA, SORT OF
 THE OLD AXIOM ARE IT'S EASIER TO
 SLOW A GAME DOWN THAN SPEED ONE
 UP.
 VIRGINIA PLAYS MOST OF OF ITS
 GAMES AT ITS TEMPO.
 'S HARD TO GET THEM TO PLAY
 FASTER.
 WE'LL SEE THIS GAME PLAYED AT A
 SLOWER PACE.
 ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT
 VIRGINIA, VIRGINIA PLAYS A
 PACKED LINE DEFENSE THAT GETS A
 LOT OF DISCUSSION, BUT WHEN THEY
 PUT UP A SHOT, THEYREE
 ■y■=>z6yR; BUT THEY'LL HAVE
 TO GET BACK AND DEFEND THE
 THREE-POINT LINE.
 USUALLYY'RE DEFENDING THE
 r■ AND BUILD BACK OUT.
 TONY: ABOUT A YEAR AGO, IT
 LOOKED LIKE BRUCE PEARL COULD
 LOSE HIS JOB AT AUBURN.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS THINKING
 NOW?
 JAY: I THINK HE'S THINKING HE
 NEEDS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS,
 THAT BRUCE PEARL HAS HAD A LOT
 OF THINGS GO ON IN HIS CAREER,
 ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE DION
 THOMAS STUFF WHEN HE WAS AN
 ASSISTANT TO TOM DAVIS, HAD THE
 ACCUSATIONS AND TAPE WITH
 ILLINOIS, CHEATING, ALL THAT
 STUFF, AND HE WAS OUT OF THE
 GAME.
 HE WAS OUT OF THE GAME FOR A
 SHOW CAUSE ABOUT REALLY A
 BARBECUE AND NOT BEING
 FORTHCOMING TO THE NCAA.
 HE'S GOT A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY
 AND HAS A GOOD TEAM.
 WITH ALL THE STUFF HANGING OVER
 COLLEGE SPORTS -- AND HONESTLY,
 IT'S NOT JUST COLLEGE
 BASKETBALL, IT'S IN OTHER AREAS
 AS WELL -- NOBODY CARES.
 LIKE NOBODY CARES.
 YOU JUST KEEP PLAYING, MAN.
 THIS IS GOING TO -- THERE ARE
 GOING TO BE PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN
 THIS WHOLE■= F LOSE
 THEIR JOBS, BUT THEñ2 TRUTH IS
 FANS DON'T CARE.
 MIKE: LET'S GO TO THE LATE GAME
 BETWEEN TEXAS TECH AND MICHIGAN
 STATE.
 REGGIE MILLER WENT TO A TEXAS
 TECH PRACTICE, AND HE SAID IT
 WAS THE BEST PRACTICE HE HAD
 EVER SEEN, WHICH LEADS ME TO ASK
 YOU WHAT IS CHRIS BEARD DOING
 THAT OTHERS ARE NOT?
 JAY: I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S
 DOING ANYTHING THAT OTHERS ARE
 NOT, BUT CHRIS IS A REALLY GOOD
 COACH.
 THEY RUN GOOD STUFF.
 HE'S A BOB KNIGHT DISCIPLE IN A
 LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS, HE'S HAD
 DIFFERENT MENTORS, BUT BOB
 KNIGHT THE MOST INFLUENTIAL.
 HE RUNS A LOT OF MOTION OFFENSE,
 WHERE THEY HAVE ROOM TO CUT.
 ALL THE CUTTERS AND THEIR
 SCREENING ACTION, THE CUTTERS
 ARE GOING TO THE BALL OR TO THE
 BASKET.
 IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO GUARD.
 IT'S DIFFICULT TO SCOUT.
 AND THEN HE -- I THINK HE HAS
 FUN.
 THEY'RE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THE
 WAY THEY GO ABOUT THEIR
 BUSINESS, BUT AFTER THEIR
 S DONE THEY DECIDE
 THEY'RE GOING TO ENJOY
 THEMSELVES AND HAVE4■I0■■ THINKG
 FUN IS DOING HARD THINGS WELL, A
 MANTRA THAT TEXAS TECH HAS HAD.
 A BUNCH OF COACHES OUT■■#■#■#■#F
 YAHOO!, AND HE SAID MICHIGAN
 STATE IS THE BEST TEAM HERE.
 WITH THAT IN MIND, I'LL ASK YOU,
 WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED IF ANYONE
 ELSE WON THIS TOURNAMENT?
 JAY: NO, I WOULD NOT BE
 SURPRISED.
 LOOK, MICHIGAN STATE MAY VERY
 WELL BE THE BEST TEAM.
 COMING INTO THIS, I RANKED
 VIRGINIA AHEAD OF MICHIGAN
 STATE.
 NOT ONLY WERE THEY A NUMBER ONE
 SEED, THEY'VE ONLY LOST THREE
 GAMES ALL YEAR LONG.
 VIRGINIA IS THE REAL DEAL.
 I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S MICHIGAN
 STATE AND VIRGINIA IN THE FINAL,
 BUT MICHIGAN STATE MATCHES UP
 WELL WITH VIRGINIA.
 THEY REBOUND BETTER, AND THAT'S
 WHERE THEY'VE BEATEN VIRGINIA IN
 THE PAST IS ON THE GLASS.
 I DON'T KNOW IF THIS YEAR IT
 WILL AS PRONOUNCED A DIFFERENCE,
 BECAUSE THIS IS A GOOD
 REBOUNDING VIRGINIA TEAM, THAT
 CAN SHOOT THE BALL FROM MULTIPLE
 POSITIONS.
 I THINK VIRGINIA IS THE BEST
 TEAM HERE, BUT FAVOR MICHIGAN
 STATE TO WIN IT BECAUSE OF
