  CALIFORNIA BRACING WITH A
  SECOND EARTHQUAKE STRIKING,
  FOUNDATIONS OF ROADS CRACKING,
  AND NOW THE FEAR ANOTHER ONE
  COULD BE COMING AS CALIFORNIA
  GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARES
  A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SAN
  BERNARDINO COUNTY.
  WELCOME, HAPPY WEEKEND, I AM
  NEO AND YOU ARE LOOKING
  AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL
  AIRPORT WHERE ALL IS CALM AFTER

  RIDGECREST CALIFORNIA
  WHERE THE FIRST EPICENTER, THAT
  IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND JEFF IN
  THE MIDDLE OF ALL.
  HOW ARE THINGS THERE NOW?
  Reporter: THERE'S A GENERAL
  FEELING OF UNEASINESS, TWO
  DAYS, TWO BIG MASSIVE
  EARTHQUAKES NEAR THIS TOWN IN
  CALIFORNIA AND THIS LATEST ONE,
  SEVERAL AFTERSHOCKS IN THE LAST
  FEW MINUTES OR SO WHEN WE WERE
  WAITING TO SPEAK WITH YOU, WE
  FELT SEVERAL OF THEM AT CITY
  HALL AND THAT UNEASINESS IS
  LEADING MANY PEOPLE NOT WANTING
  TO LEAP -- SLEEP INSIDE THEIR
  HOUSE LASTLY.
  WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE SHERIFF'S
  DEPUTY GOING STREET TO STREET
  TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WERE OKAY.
  HE SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING
  OUTSIDE OR COMING HERE TO CITY
  HALL WHERE THERE IS A SHELTER
  SET UP.
  MAYBE WE COULD PULL UP THE
  ACTUAL SOUND ON THIS.
  THIS IS THE MOMENT WE WERE AT A
  RESTAURANT, STARTED TO FEEL THE
  RUMBLING, THE VIOLENT SHAKING
  AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
  THAT.
  TAKE A LISTEN. YOU COULD REALLC
  IN PEOPLE'S VOICES.
  THIS WAS A RESTAURANT RIGHT
  HERE IN RIDGECREST AND T
  WAS A SLIGHT AFTERSHOCK BEFORE
  THIS AND EVERY ONE, THEY HAVE
  BEEN THROUGH A FEW IN THE LAST
  DAY BUT  THE 7.1
  THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS SHAKING,
  DISHES CRASHING ON THE GROUND
  AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE IN
  DISBELIEF, SOME HITTING THE
  GROUND IN TEARS AND SHORTLY
  AFTER WALKING OUT OF THIS
  RESTAURANT WE LOOKED INTO THE
  DISTANCE AND WE SEE A HUGE
  PLUME OF SMOKE, WE GET CLOSER
  AND REALIZE THIS HOUSE IS ON
  FIRE AND THIS IS AT LEAST ONE
  HOUSE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE, A
  LOT OF THESE FRTED
  BECAUSE OF RUPTURED GAS LINES.
  WE ARE ONLY HEARING OF SOME
  MINOR INJURIES, AND THINGS
  FALLING ON PEOPLE, REPORTS OF
  ANY DEPTH BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS
  DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY,
  HAS REQUESTED A PRESIDENTIAL
  DECLARATION, HELP FROM THE
  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
  SO FAR THE PRESIDENT HASN'T
  TWEETED ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED
  IN CALIFORNIA.
  CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN
  NEWSOM HAS DECLARED A STATE OF
  EMERGENCY FOR AT LEAST SAN
  BERNARDINO COUNTY AND BRACING
  FOR MORE.
  THAT HAS EVERYONE ON
  TENTERHOOKS.
  WHAT KIND OF MORE DOES THAT
  MEAN?
  HOW MUCH MORE?
  ON THE PHONE WITH US IS PUBLIC
  INFORMATION OFFICER FROM THE
  GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND EMERGENCY
  SERVICE, THANK YOU FOR TAKING
  THE TIME.
  HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING?
  WE HAVE BEEN WORKING
  OVERNIGHT SINCE THE SECOND
  EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED YESTERDAY
  EVENING.
  THE SECOND EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED
  RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET, DARKNESS
  PREVENTED US FROM DOING A LOT.
  WE JUST HAD SUNRISE IN
  CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST HOUR SO
  IT IS CRUCIAL FOR US GETTING
  INTO RIDGECREST AND AFFECTED
  AREAS TO SEE WHAT DAMAGE WE ARE
  TALKING AB■■D THERE
  ARE SOME INJURIES BUT WE DON'T
  KNOW HOW MUCH ANARD
  INSIDE THEIR HOMES.NT TO GO
  WE NEE WHAT NEEDS THEY

  "CAVUTO" WE HAVE NOT HEARD
  REPORTS OF SIGNIFICANT
  INJURIES.
  WE ARE HAVING BRIEFINGS ALL
  NIGHT, CREWS AROUND THE
  OPERATIONS CENTER.
  WE HAVE SERIOUS INJURIES, THERE
  ARE SOME BUT HOW MUCH, HOW
  SERIOUS THE INJURIES THEY ARE,
  HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED
  IN SOME OF THE POWER LINES AND
  GAS LINES HAVE BEEN BROKEN SO
  WE NEED TO GET IN AND FIND OUT
  WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH.
  THESE AFTERSHOCKS ARE MORE
  SIGNIFICANT THAN THE MENT
  BY A FACTOR OF 10 TIMES AND I'M
  WONDERING HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT
  FOR IANS WHO ARE ALWAYSACED FO
  THIS KIND OF STUFF?
  ■ WILL DEFER TO THE
  GEOLOGISTS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
  TO FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS.
  NOT THAT UNCOMMON AND WHAT WE
  ARE SEEING IS THE INITIAL
  EARTHQUAKE WE SAW WAS NOT
  CONSIDERED A MAIN EARTHQUAKE,
  THE BIGGER THE EARTHQUAKE, THAT
  BECOMES THE MAIN ONE.
  NOW IS 7.1.
  IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY EVENING,
  THAT WAS THE MAIN EARTHQUAKE
  AND THE ONE ON THE FOURTH OF
  JULY IS BEING CALLED A 4 SHOCK.
  NOT THAT UNCOMMON IF YOU TALK
  TO THE GEOLOGISTS.
  NEIL: WE GET ANECDOTAL REPORTS,
  A PEOPLE AFRAID TO SLEEP IN
  THEIR HOME SO THEY ARE IN THEIR
  DRIVEWAY OR SLEEPING OUTSIDE,
  THEY ARE THAT ANXIOUS.
  HOW WIDESPREAD IS THAT?
  I HAVEN'T BEEN IN RIDGECREST
  BUT I DON'T BLAME THEM.
  IT HAS BEEN 48 HOURS IN THE
  SHAKING HAS BEEN VERY VIOLENT
  AT TIMES AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE
  OUTSIDE TO FEEL A LITTLE SAFER
  AND THE PROBLEM IS WHAT WE HAVE
  EARTHQUAKES IS CAN'T PREDICT
  WHEN THE NEXT ONE WILL HAPPEN.
  YOU CAN TRY TO GIVE ADVANCED
  WARNING BUT EVEN SECONDS IS A
  GOOD MORNING.
  IF THERE'S A TRAIN RUNNING
  THROUGH THE AREA WE STOP
  ELEVATORS BUTT HAVE A
  SYSTEM THAT CAN PREDICT FROM
  MINUTES AWAY WHEN SOMETHING
  WILL HAPPEN.
  NEIL: YOU'VE HAD LITTLE IF ANY
  SLEEP SO WE APPRECIATE YOU
  UPDATING US.
  THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF
  EMERGENCY SERVICES, THE
  PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED ON THIS.
  THIS MORNING, UPDATES ON THAT
  7.1 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE.
  ALLISON BARBER IS WITH THE
  PRESIDENT, WHERE THE
  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS SPENDING
  THE WEEKEND.
  THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS DONALD
  TRUMP WAS BRIEFED ON THE LATEST
  EARTHQUAKE IN CALIFORNIA
  OVERNIGHT, AROUND 1:00 AM THE
  WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY HAD TEAMS
  CLOSELY MONITORING THE
  SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY
  WOULD BE PROVIDING UPDATES TO
  THE PRESIDENT THROUGHOUT THE
  NIGHT, DONALD TRUMP IS IN NEW
  JERSEY STAYING AT A GOLF CLUB
  IN THAT MINSTER AND AS OF THIS
  MORNING TWEETING ABOUT
  IMMIGRATION, JOE BIDEN AND THE
  ECONOMY.
  THE PERMIT OF LABOR SAYS US
  ECONOMY ADDED 20,000 JOBS IN
  JUNE, THAT IS UP FROM 72,000 IN
  MAY.
  OUR COUNTRY CONTINUES TO DO
  REALLY WELL, REALLY REALLY
  WELL.
  WE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT.
  WE ARE GOING TO BE BREAKING
  RECORDS.
  TO LOWER INTEREST RATES IT
  WOULD BE LIKE A ROCKETSHIP.
  Reporter: DONALD TRUMP
  CONTINUES CRITIQUES OF THE
  FEDERAL RESERVE ON TWITTER
  WRITING OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND
  THE WORLD ARE DOING ANYTHING
  POSSIBLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
  THE UNITED STATES KNOWING OUR
  FEDERAL RESERVE DOES NOT HAVE A
  CLUE.
        AGGRESSIVELY CRITICIZED D  REPEATEDLY GONE AFTER THE FED
  AND THE CHAIRMAN.
  HE CRITICIZED THE FED FOR
  RAISING RATES, NOT DOING ENOUGH
  TO HELP THE US ECONOMY, JAY
  POWELL HAS EMPHASIZED THE FED
  IS INDEPENDENT AND WHEN ASKED
  ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, REPORTED
  THE FED WOULD NEVER TAKE
  POLITICAL CONSIDERATION INTO
  ACCOUNT OR DISCUSS THEM AS PART
  OF THEIR WORK.
  HE SAID THEIR PRIORITY WAS
  WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN
  PEOPLE.
  WITH THE PRESIDENT IN NEW
  JERSEY.
  WITH A STRONG JOBS REPORT IT IS
  TOUGH TO MAKE THE CASE THAT THE
  ECONOMY IS JUST TANKING.
  WHAT DO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
  DO?

  OUR ECONOMY MUCH BETTER THAN  IT HAS EVER BEEN.
  FROM ELECTION DAY, 50% INCREASE
  AND WE PAID TRILLIONS OF
  DOLLARS.
  NEIL: A 50% INCREASE, THE DOW
  JONES INDUSTRIAL SURGING SINCE
  HE WAS FIRST ELECTED, THE
  PRESIDENT SAYING HE IS A BIG
  REASON FOR THAT AND OPTIMISM
  AHEAD OF HIS INAUGURATION AND
  WHAT HE HAS DONE SINCE HAVE
  MADE THE CHANGES AND BOOMING
  JOBS REPORT FEW PEOPLE SAW
  COMING.
  2020 DEMOCRATS PORTRAYING AN
  ECONOMY NOT NEARLY AS ROBUST AS
  THE NUMBERS INDICATE, LAUREN
  LEADER IT IS WITH US, JOSEPH
  PINION AND HOST OF FOX NATION,
  BEGIN WITH WHAT THE PRESIDENT
  IS SAYING, DENYING THE NUMBERS,
  CREDIT FOR THOSE NUMBERS.
  THAT IS THE SECOND PART A
  LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM
  WITH.
  THE ECONOMY IS DOING VERY WELL,
  THAT IS OBJECTIVELY TRUE AND
  WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING SO IF
  ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IT WOULD BE
  AND IT HAS BEEN.
  WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL
  AFFECT COMMAND AT THE SAME
  TIME, POLLS HAVEN'T ALWAYS
  ACCURATELY REPRESENTED HOW MUCH
  SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT HAS IF
  YOU LOOK AT 2016.
  IT IS HARD TO SAY BUT IT WILL
  BE HARD FOR THE DEMOCRATS
  BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SAY THE
  ECONOMY IS A DISASTER, HARD TO
  ARGUE AGAINST SOMETHING THAT IS
  DOING SO WELL.
  NEIL: YOU CAN'T SAY THE ECONOMY

  GALLUP POLL TAKEN A COUPLE
  WEEKS AGO COMPARED TO A YEAR
  AGO WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF
  POLITICAL QUESTIONS BUT HOW DO
  YOU VIEW THE ECONOMY.
  46% OF AMERICANS THINK THE
  ECONOMY IS POOR OR VERY BAD AND
  THAT IS THE SAME NUMBER IT WAS
  A YEAR AGO.
  NEIL: HOW WAS UNDER BARACK
  OBAMA?
  I DIDN'T LOOK AT EVERY
  SINGLE YEAR.
  IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME BECAUSE
  WE WERE STILL COMING OUT OF
  RECESSION.
  THE POINT IS THE PRESIDENT, IT
  SHOULD LOOK LIKE A BETTER
  PICTURE.
  THE IMPACT OF THE TARIFFS ON
  FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST, ONGOING
  TRADE GROWTH IS BEGINNING TO
  CHANGE, STARTING TO RISE
  SLIGHTLY.
  VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS
  COULDN'T MANAGE A $200
  UNEXPECTED MEDICAL --
  NEIL: THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE
  ARE DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN
  PRESIDENTS.
  DEMOCRATS WILL SAY OF THE
  ECONOMY SO GOOD WHY AREN'T WE
  INVESTING IN THE WORKING CLASS
  TO RDEBT, TALK ABOUT
  TRILLIONS --
  NEIL: LIKE ME GIVING DIETARY
  ADVICE.
  THE DEBT HAS EXPLODED UNDER
  THIS ADMINISTRATION.
  NEIL: UNDER THE PRIOR ONE.
  ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT
  HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO TAKE
  ADVANTAGE OF, THE POINTS THAT
  WERE RAISED, THERE WERE 1
  MILLION MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS
  EMPLOYED THAN WHEN BARACK OBAM■
  LEFT OFFICE.
  WITH THOSE GROUPS HE IS STILL
  UNDERWATER.
  WHY IS THAT?
  MESSAGING ACROSS THE BOARD,
  THEY ARE BETTER SERVED NOT
  TALKING ABOUT HISPANIC
  IMPLEMENT A BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT
  BUT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
  POVERTY.
  HAVING SAID THAT IF DEMOCRATS
  TELL YOU PEOPLE ING TWO
  WITH THREE JOBS THEY HAVE BEEN
  THIS WHOLE TIME.
  THE DIFFERENCES THOSE TWO OR
  THREE JOBS ARE PAYING MORE
  UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION.
  NEIL: PEOPLE WORKING TWO OR
  MORE JOBS, A HARD NUMBER
  NEVERTHELESS BUT EVERYBODY IS
  WORKING.
  WAGE GROWTH IS TAKING UP AS
  JOB GROWTH IS TICKING UP.
  WAGE GROWTH FOR
  AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS
  HAS NO
  NEIL: IT HAS BEENAE■E■E■E■E■E■E
  TO 3%.
  DOUBLE THAT THROUGH WHITE
  AMERICA.
  THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
  TARGETING DEMOCRATS CLOSER TO
  3%, NOT NARROWING THE GAP BUT
  IT IS BEGINNING TO.
  WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS WHETHER
  THE ARGUMENTS DEMOCR
  RAISING WILL COME BACK TO BITE
  THEM BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE LOOK
  AT THIS, I CAN DEAL WITH THIS.
  IT WILL BE TOUGH, FOCUSING
  ON OTHER THINGS LIKE
  HEALTHCARE.
  THAT THE GOOD THING TO FOCUS ON
  BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS
  HAD A CHANCE TO FIX THAT AND
  THAT GOT MESSED UP.
  I THINK HE STOMPS ON HIS OWN
  -- STOP SAYING AND GET AWAY.
  HE DISTRACTS FROM THE
  MESSAGE OF THE ECONOMY.
  HE TALKS ABOUT IT BUT THEN HE
  WILL TWEET SOMETHING ALL THE
  WAY OUT THERE OR GO AFTER
  SOMEBODY, CALL SOMEONE A LOSER
  AND PEOPLE FOCUS ON THOSE
  THINGS MORE THAN THE ECONOMY.
  I AM A LOSER, I ALREADY KNOW
  I'M A LOSER, WHAT ARE YOU GOING
  TO DO?
  NEIL: WHEN I LOOK AT THE
                           DATA  THAT COMES IN, BIG STATES LIKE
  PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN AND
  INDIANA WE ARE TALKING WAGES
  GROWING FASTER THAN THE REST OF
  THE NATION YET TO YOUR POINT HE
  IS TRAILING BY DOUBLE DIGITS SO
  -- NOT IN INDIANA.
  WHOLE PICTURE.
  AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE IN
  COMMON TO GROWTH WHICH WE DON'T
  DENY IS REAL AND THE GROWTH IN
  JOBS YOU HAVE THIS EXPLOSION,
  THE ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN
  DREAM GOT MORE EXPENSIVE,
  WEIGHING DOWN MORE FAMILIES,
  NOT JUST THE KIDS WHO WERE TOLD
  THE GRANDPARENTS WHO WERE
  SADDLED WITH DEBT, THE RISING
  COST OF HEALTHCARE AND HOUSING
  THEY TALKED ABOUT, COST OF
  LIVING IN EVERY METROPOLITAN
  AREA.
  AND BENEFITS ILLEGALS.
  IS THAT ENOUGH TO TURN THE
  TIDE?
  CHALLENGES OF WORKING-CLASS
  AND MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS, AND
  BENEFITING FROM THE STOCK
  MARKET EXCEPT MAYBE A 401(K).
  AND ANOTHER 46%.
  THE POINT IS --
  NEIL: WHAT ABOUT THE NUMBERS ON
  MINORITY GAINS?
  ALL THE POLLS THAT ASK
  WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS HOW
  THEY FEEL, DO THEY FEEL THEY
  ARE BENEFITING FROM THIS
  ECONOMY THE ANSWER IS NO THEY
  DO NOT.
  NEIL: HIGH MARKS IN THE ECONOMY
  BUT NOT FOR HIM HIMSELF.
  DEMOCRATS HAVE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I HAVE A
  SOLUTION FOR THAT.
  NEIL: THE ECONOMY --
  THE REALITY, NOT EVERYONE
  INVESTING IN THE STOCK MARKET.
  IT WILL BE DIFFICULT.
  NEIL: BENEFITING FROM THE
  HIGHER MARKET OR PENSION FUNDS
  THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
  INVESTED.
  MUCH CONFIDENCE IS AN
  INDICATOR ON -- IF YOU TAKE A
  STEP BACK.
  NEIL: WE ARE THINKING OF PEOPLE
  FOR WHOM THE MARKET BOOM --
  I RECOGNIZE PEOPLE SAY I AM
  NOT INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP.
  DIFFICULT FOR DEMOCRATS TO
  STAND UP AND SAY YOUR 401(K)
  GOING UP IS YOUR IMAGINATION.
  NEIL: THE FACT THAT ON THESE ■i
  WEDGE ISSUES AND WHAT YOU'RE
  DOING ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND
  HEALTHCARE FOR ALL WILL
  REGISTER.
  IT IS A BIGGER PICTURE THAN
  THE STOCK MARKET.■■@■@■
  NEIL: THINGS THAT WILL LEAK OUT
  SUPPORT.
  DEMOCRATS HAVE A BIG STAGE
  FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS, AND
  POLICY SOLUTIONS, THEY WILL OWN
  THAT AND THE PRESIDENT --
  NEIL: OUT OF STEP WITH
  DEMOCRATIC VOTERS, HEALTH
  BENEFITS TO ILLEGALS.
  THE BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE A
  JOB YESTERDAY AND SOMEBODY WHO
  HAS A JOB TOMORROW NOT BEING
  ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM THEIR
  LIFE IS WORSE OFF.
  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
  THE VISCERAL IMPACT DONALD
  TRUMP'S WORDS HAVE ON EVERYDAY
  LIFE.
  WHEN YOU SHOW UP IN NOVEMBER,
  AND --
  SOMETHING WE HAVE NEVER
  SEEN, AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE
  TO CUT INTEREST RATES.
  IS THERE SOMETHING I AM
  MISSING?

        Hey, who are you?
 Oh, hey Jeff, I'm a car thief...
              What?!
           I'm here to     steal your car because,
       well, that's my job.
              What?
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What?!
             [crash]
              WHAT?!
        Haha, it happens.
        And if you've got     cut-rate car insurance,
      paying for this could
 feel like getting robbed twice.
        So get Allstate...
     and be better

  Coach! It's kinda hard to see  the ball.
        I've been there.
  I had a TV service with hardly  any sports in 4K.
 Couldn't see any of the quality details.
 I switched to DIRECTV, now I get the most live sports in 4K.
    So how does that help me?
       It really doesn't.
   I don't know why I told you   that. Go get 'em sport!
  <i> Live sports that aren't in 4K</i>  <i> are just kinda TV.</i>
   <i> Don't just kinda TV. DIRECTV</i>
  <i> Don't have 4K? Call</i>  <i> 1.855.WATCH.4K and ask for it</i>  <i> today.</i>
  GETTING OUR FIRST IMAGES,  AND THE SUN BEGINS TO RISE.
  THESE ARE FROM KT TV, 7.1
  MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE, MAKING IT
  HIGHER BY A FACTOR TEN TIMES
  THAN IT WAS 24 HOURS AGO, NO
  REPORTS OF SERIOUS INJURY OR
  WORSE SO FAR.
  THERE IS THAT.
  WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED ON
  AFTERSHOCKS■bc■bcbbcbbcbbcbbcb#
  AND LET'S GET THE VIEW FROM
  WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND AARON
  GIBBS.
  AND OUR VERY OWN FOXBUSINESS
  NETWORK'S DEIRDRE BOLTON.
  THAT WAS THE BATTLE BACK AND
  FORTH YESTERDAY.
  IT IS STRONG AND WE LIKE THAT.
  GOOD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS BUT THAT
  IS WHEN IT MEANS THE FEDERAL
  RESERVE --
  HARRIS: IF WE LOOK AT WHAT
  TRADERS ARE ANTICIPATING, MOST
  PEOPLE ARE LOSING THIS IN JULY.
  THE IDEA OF A 50 BASIS POINT
  CUT SEEMS TO NOT BE A REAL
  POSSIBILITY.
  AND TO YOUR POINT DO WE NEED IT
  ALL OR DO WE NEED IT NOW?
  THE MARKET CLEARLY PRICING IT
  IN.
  AND THE LAST PIECE OF DATA THE
  FED WAS GETTING LAST FRIDAY,
  THERE WERE A FEW THINGS YOU
  COULD NOT BE THRILLED WITH.
  THE WAGE GROWTH STARTED TO
  DROP.
  NEIL: 1%.
  NOT AS STRONG.
  THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT TRADE
  WAR, SLOWLY MOVING FORWARD.
  THE LAST TIME THEY TALKED THE
  BIG ISSUE WAS CONCERN, THE
  GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN.EEEEEE
  THE US IS GOOD, AT THE END OF
  JULY.
  THE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE, THE
  STRONG ECONOMY NOT AS STRONG AS
  WE HAD BUT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
  ARROWS IN YOUR QUIVER.
  DO YOU WAIT TO DO TIME IN AN
  ENVIRONMENT AS GOOD AS THIS?
  LIKE THAT MOVIE THE FAST AND
  FURIOUS WHEN YOU THE NITROUS
  TOO EARLY?
  NEIL: THE EXACT SAME THING.
  IT IS PSYCHOLOGICAL.
  ON PURE INFLATION TERMS WE
  COULD HAVE LOWER INTEREST
  RATES.
  GOOD TO HAVE THE INTEREST RATE
  CURVE BE UPWARDS.
  PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT.
  IF THEY DO THAT, 1% OR 1.5 --
  A LITTLE MORE.
  IF THEY DO THAT, WAIT A SECOND,
  WE ARE ALREADY RECYCLING THE
  MONEY, WE ARE DOWN TO 1%.
  WE ARE INCREASING SPENDING AND
  A LITTLE PANIC AND IF THE FED
  WANTS TO SHOW OFF YOU DON'T
  HAVE THAT MANY LEFT AT THIS
  POINT.
  NEIL: THE TREASURY NOTES AND
  BONDS --
  THEY COULD GET OUT OF IT AND
  TRYING TO SLOWLY WHAT THE
  INTEREST PAYMENTS -- MORE
  LONG-TERM DEBT WHICH IS THE
  REASON INTEREST RATES FELL SO
  MUCH DESPITE THE ECONOMY
  SLOWING WHICH GETS THE WHOLE
  THING, WHAT IS GOING ON IS THE
  MARKET -- IN THE SHORT RUN
  THERE WAS A BIG BET THAT THE
  ECONOMY IS WEAKENING, GETTING
  THE FED TO LOWER RATES AND IT
  IS NOT THAT WEEK SO WE GET A
  BIG BOOST AND THAT STORY
  CHANGED.
  NEIL: THEY SAY A GREAT REPORT
  WILL BE REPORTED FAVORABLY AND
  A BAD REPORT, THAT SETS YOU UP.
  GOOD NEWS IS BAD NEWS, BAD
  NEWS IS GOOD NEWS BUT WHEN YOU
  TALK ABOUT THE TOOL I THINK THE
  FED DECIDED THAT BY CUTTING
  RATES, NOT CUTTING RATES, THE
  QE WAS DIFFICULT AND THERE WAS
  A BIT OF HOCUS-POCUS.
  NEIL: THE PRESIDENT WAS A
  CRITIC AND DO THAT FOR ME AND
  REALLY AWESOME.
  IT COULD BE ADDED BACK IN
  BUT THE TIGHTENING, THEY LET IT
  GET SO OUT OF HAND FOR SO LONG.
  JUST SMALL QUARTER POINT RATE
  CUTS.
  THE IDEA OF A CUT FOR THIS WAS
  A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE.
  THE EXPECTATIONS ARE MORE
  RATIONAL.
  TALKING ABOUT DEFLATIONARY
  WORRIES, TO YOUR POINT THERE
  WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE, THERE
  WERE DEFINITE ARGUMENTS BEING
  MADE IN THE WASHINGTON POST,
  THE ECONOMY, BLOOMBERG
  BUSINESSWEEK, NO ONE IS SAYING
  THIS IS HAPPENING BUT SHOULD
  THIS BE NOW WHAT WE ARE WORRIED
  ABOUT?
  NEIL: I ALWAYS SAY WE HAVEN'T
  GOT THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS
  BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM HAVEN'T
  REACHED CONSUMERS YET.
  OBVIOUSLY EVENTUALLY THAT WILL
  HAPPEN.
  IF THEY GET A TRADE DEAL ALL
  BETS ARE OFF.
  THE FUNNY THING IS IF WE LOWER
  INTEREST RATES, THE WEAKENED
  DOLLAR HAS THE EFFECT OF THE
  TARIFF AND COUNTRY SEE 5% OR
  10% INCREASE IN THE PRESIDENT
  WAS TALKING ABOUT HAVING RATES
  TOO HIGH, THE DOLLAR IS TOO
  STRONG.
  NEIL: HE WOULD IMPROVE --
  OTHER EXPORTERS, GERMANY IS
  HAPPY WITH OUR 2% AND THEY HAVE

  GERMANY, ACTUALLY YOU ARE
  PAYING FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO
  LEND YOUR MONEY TO THE
  GOVERNMENT.
  THEY HAVE NEGATIVE RATES.
  NEIL: ARE WE GOING THERE?
  I DON'T SEE IS GOING TO
  NEGATIVE RATES.
  WE ARE IN A HEALTHIER
  ENVIRONMENT.
  NEIL: ARE WE AT THIS STAGE?
  I AM
          BULLISH BUT I AM  CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.
  WE WOULD PROBABLY BE 1%.
  THE ECONOMY, STRONGER INFLATION
  BUT WE BORROW MUCH MORE.
  THE ACTUAL BALANCED BUDGET
  DEFICITS.
  THEY ARE RUNNING A STRICT,
  AUSTERE PROGRAM.bd

  SECOND PRIVATE FACEBOOK GROUP
  AND ONE THAT WAS TAKEN DOWN
  LATER THAN THE FIRST ONE.
  THE NATIONAL BORDER PATROL,
  BRANDON JUDD, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
  DO YOU KNOW THE LATEST OF
  FACEBOOK POSTINGS THAT INVOLVE
  FORMER AGENTS THAN THE ORIGINAL
  ROUNDUP THAT WAS CRITICAL OF
  ILLEGALS BEING HELD AT THE
  DETENTION CENTERS EVEN THOUGH
  IT IS VISITING DETENTION
  CENTERS?
  A COUPLE FACEBOOK PAGES ARE
  OUT THERE.
  YOU HAVE SOME REAL CVP NATIONS
  WAS ALWAYS FACEBOOK PAGES HAVE
  BEEN CRITICAL OF ILLEGAL ALIENS
  AND CERTAIN LAWMAKERS.
  SOME THINGS ARE FINE, THERE'S
  PLENTY OF POLITICAL TALK AND
  YOU CAN DO THAT, ABSOLUTELY
  REPREHENSIBLE AND I AM AWARE
  THERE HAVE BEEN 13 LETTERS SENT
  OUT TO EMPLOYEES THAT ARE CEASE
  AND DESIST LETTERS, THEY NEED
  TO STOP THEIR FACEBOOK POSTS
  AND NOW THE INVESTIGATION HAS
  TO GO INTO THE NATURE THAT
  VIOLATES POLICY AND THEY NEED
  TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
  NEIL: DO YOU MEAN FIRED?
  IT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF
  THE POST.
  IF THEY ARE RELEASING
  INFORMATION ABOUT LAW
  ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION, THEY
  ARE VERY STRICT.
  NEIL: WHAT ABOUT RACIST
  COMMENTS?
  RACIST COMMENTS, WE CANNOT
  AS UNIFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE
  CANNOT SHOW THE WE HAVE A BIAS.
  WE CANNOT PROPERLY ENFORCE THE
  LAW.
  THERE IS NO PLACE IN LAW
  ENFORCEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS
  THAT ARE RACIST, NO PLACE IN
  LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HATE OTHER
  GROUPS OF PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU
  CANNOT ENFORCE THE LAWS
  PROPERLY IF YOU BRING THAT BIAS
  INTO THE WORKPLACE.
  NEIL: SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER
  CALLED FOR THE FIRING OF MARK
  MORGAN, OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER
  PROTECTION, ULTIMATELY PICKED
  TO LEAD THE AGENCY BECAUSE OF
  WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNDER HIM.
  ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
  COMMISSIONER MORGAN WHEN HE WAS
  THERE, HE WAS AWARE OF ONE POST
  AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK ACTION AND
  TOOK THE MOST SEVERE ACTION HE
  COULD TAKE UNDER LABOR LAWS AT
  THAT TIME.
  COMMISSIONER MORGAN DID WHAT HE
  NEEDED TO DO.
  SENATOR SCHUMER CALLED FOR
  DETERMINATION BEFORE HE WAS THE
  COMMISSIONER, AND CALL FOR HIS
  TERMINATION.
  SENATOR SCHUMER HAS A
  COMPLETELY WRONG AND LOOK AT
  THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE A
  LONG TIME, SHOULD HAVE BEEN
  AWARE OF THIS AND SHOULD HAVE
  TAKEN PROPER ACTION.
  NEIL: I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE
  TRUTH START AND EXAGGERATION
  BEGINS ON FACEBOOK POSTINGS BUT
  ONE THING POLITICO AND OTHERS
  REPORTED IS HIGH REPS WERE MORE
  AWARE OF THIS.
  DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ANY OF IT?
  THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS.
  CVP IS REQUIRED TO MONITOR WHAT
  AGENTS ARE DOING WHETHER IT IS
  ON DUTY OR OFF DUTY.
  FACEBOOK PAGES, THEY WERE AWARE
  OF THESE PAGES.
  NEIL: DID THEY TAKE IT DOWN?
  IF YOU LOOK AT THESE
  FACEBOOK PAGES THERE WERE A
  GREAT MANY HIGH-LEVEL MANAGERS
  ON THESE PAGES.
  THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY AWARE OF
  IT AND HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO
  DO SOMETHING AND DIDN'T.
  I WILL POINT BACK TO 2017,
  ALMOST TWO YEARS TO THE DATE,
  THE NATIONAL BORDER PATROL
  COUNCIL SENT AN ADVISORY TO
  AGENTS TELLING THEM TO BE
  CAREFUL WHAT YOU ARE POSTING ON
  FACEBOOK, THERE ARE CERTAIN
  THINGS YOU CAN POST, CERTAIN
  THINGS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY
  INAPPROPRIATE AND COULD
  POTENTIALLY AFFECT YOUR JOB
  STATUS AND CVP DIDN'T FOLLOW
  UP.
  IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACEBOOK
  POSTS, WE WERE THE FIRST TO
  COME OUT AND CONDEMN THOSE
  POSTS WHEN THE ARTICLE BROKE,
  THE AGENCY CAME IN LATER IN
  THIS HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS
  AND IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING.
  WE WANT THE MOST HONORABLE
  ORGANIZATIONS, AND WE ARE
  CHARGED WITH DETERMINING THE
  BORDER AND HAVE TO DO IT
  PROPERLY.
  THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE
  TIME.
  JOINING US OUT OF THE CITY.
  MEANWHILE INNIA, THIS
  IS RIDGECREST, NO REPORTS
  SIGNIFJURIES.
  AND THE SERVICE DIRECTOR, MORE
  SERIOUS DAMAGE AS DAYLIGHT
  EMERGES AND THEY Rq■■■q■q■■■q■U
  EARTHQUAKE, AFTER 6.4 UDE
  EARTHQUAKE THE DORE.
  THAT IS TECHNICALLY 10 TIMES
  MORE SERIOUS.
               ■ww■■■■  NEIL: WE JUST HEARD FROM BORDER
  PATROL BRANDON JUDD, A DEMOCRAT
  WHO ISN'T IMPRESSED WITH WHAT
  HE'S HEARING FROM BORDER
  OFFICIALS.
  CONGRESSMAN OUR GREEN, GOOD TO
  HAVE YOU.
  YOUR THE CONGRESSMAN, THE BIG
  CHEESE, LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON
  WHAT DAMAGE IT IS SAYING, IF HE
  FINDS, THAT THESE OF NOXIOUS
  COMMENTS, BORDER AGENTS HAVEN'T
  CHARGED WITH ON THESE FACEBOOK
  POSTS, HE WOULD ADVOCATE, IS
  THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?
  IT IS GOOD ENOUGH.
  I AM SURE OTHER THINGS NEED TO
  BE DONE AS WELL BUT IF A PERSON
  EXHIBITS RACIAL VIEWS THAT ARE
  ABHORRENT, RACISM AS IT IS
  CALLED BY THE AGENTS, I COMMEND
  THEM.
  IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER
  TERMINATING THE RELATIONSHIP.
  NEIL: THIS MEASURE THAT WAS
  APPROVED IN CONGRESS,
  $4.6 MILLION FUNDING TO DEAL
  WITH THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER,
  DID YOU VOTE FOR THAT?
  I DID.
  LELAND: YOU DID SOLD TO EASE
  THE CONGESTION OF THE PROBLEM
  WITH THE KIDS?
  I DID FOR A MULTIPLICITY OF
  REASONS.
  I UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE WHO
  DIDN'T DID NOT DO SO.
  I DID SO BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN
  TALKING FOR SOME TIME ABOUT
  CONDITIONS AT THE BORDER.
  I SAW THE CONDITIONS AND I
  WANTED TO DO WHAT I COULD TO BE
  HELPFUL BUT I UNDERSTAND THOSE
  WHO CHOSE NOT TO, HIGHLIGHT THE
  FACT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE
  TRANSPARENCY AND
  ACCOUNTABILITY.
  I RESPECT WHAT THEY DID.
  FOR ME, SEEING WHAT THEY DID
  WITH HER FATHER ON THE SHORES
  OF THE RIVER, TOUCHED MY HEART
  IN A WAY THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
  FOR ME TO VOTE OTHERWISE.
  LELAND: THESE CHILDREN IN
  MIGRANT CENTERS IS QUINTUPLE
  WHAT IT WAS UNDER THESE
  FACILITIES, BUT NOT PREPARED,
  AND HOMELAND SECURITY.
  THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE
  QUESTION.
  I HAVE A QUESTION THAT MIRRORS
  AN ANSWER.
  WE ARE THERE TO FACILITATE THE
  LAW OR TO DETER PEOPLE FROM
  COMING INTO THE COUNTRY?
  IN THE EARLY PART OF THE 19TH
  CENTURY WERE PROCESSING 5000
  PEOPLE-10,000 PEOPLE A DAY,
  NEVER SEPARATED CHILDREN FROM
  THEIR PARENTS.
  PERSONS WERE FLEEING
  SCANDINAVIA AND EASTERN EUROPE
  AND CAME BY THE MILLIONS AND WE
  PROCESSED THEM.
  DO WE WANT TO PROCESS PEOPLE
  FIND A MEANS BY WHICH WE CAN
  DETER THEM?
  NEIL: THESE NUMBERS ARE
  STAGGERING, MORPHING WHAT
  BARACK OBAMA WAS DEALING WITH,
  SEPARATING KIDS FROM FAMILIES
  TO MAKE SURE THOSE WITH WHOM WE
  WERE TRAVELING WERE RELATED?
  COMPARED TO THOSE COMING
  THROUGH ELLIS ISLAND THEY ARE
  NOT DWARFING THEM ESPECIALLY
  GIVEN --
  LELAND: RIGHT AT THE BORDER, IT
  IS A DIFFERENT DAY RIGHT HERE,
  RIGHT NOW.
  DO YOU THINK THE $4.6 BILLION
  IS ALLOCATED TO DEAL WITH --
  WOULD YOU BE HAPPY THE SAME
  FOLKS OR DO YOU WANT SOMEONE
  ELSE?
  I HAVE TO SAY THIS.
  THOSE COMING THROUGH ELLIS
  ISLAND, RIGHT THERE, RIGHT
  THEN, WE WELCOME THEM.
  THERE SEEMS TO BE A REMOVAL OF
  THE WELCOME MAT.
  NEIL: WE WELCOME THEM BECAUSE
  THERE WERE ASSURANCES OF FAMILY
  OR FRIENDS WHO COULD TAKE THEM
  IN AND TAKE CARE OF THEM AND
  NOT THE UNITED STATES
  GOVERNMENT.
  A GOOD MANY OF THEM DID NOT.
  THEY HAVE FAMILY, FRIENDS WHO
  COULD ASSIST THEM AS WELL BUT
  WE ARE TURNING THEM AWAY
  WITHOUT GIVING THEM ENERGY TO A
  CERTAIN EXTENT BY PUSHING THE
  INTERVIEW PROCESS TO MEXICO.
  TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER
  THE PERSONS IN CHARGE WHO
  SHOULD REMAIN IN CHARGE, IT IS
  MY OPINION THAT PERSONS IN
  CHARGE ARE VICTIMS THEMSELVES
  BECAUSE THEY ARE FORCED TO
  ENFORCE POLICIES THAT QUITE
  FRANKLY ARE ABHORRENT.
  THE POLICY OF SEPARATING
  CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS, NO
  COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE SUCH
  POLICY.
  NEIL: YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT
  HAPPENED.
  WHEN BARACK OBAMA -- HE SIMPLY
  DIDN'T KNOW WHERE KIDS WERE
  COMING FROM.
  HE DIDN'T FORMALLY SEPARATE
  THEM FROM AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF
  TIME BUT RECOGNIZED SOME OF
  THEM IS USED AS LEVERAGE TO GET
  INTO THIS COUNTRY.
  YOU AMONG ANY FOLKS HAVE
  SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
  APPROPRIATE BUT THE
  OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE
  PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE TO
  ESCAPE PERSECUTION, ESCAPE
  CRIME.
  I JUST RETURNED FROM EL
  SALVADOR TO BRING BACK A
  CONSTITUENT WHO HAD BEEN
  DEPORTED.
  WE BROUGHT HIM HOME, HE HAD A
  10 YEAR BAR, HE WAS MARRIED TO
  AN AMERICAN WOMAN, HAD TWO
  AMERICAN CHILDREN, HE REPORTED
  TO ICE AND WAS DEPORTED WITH
  MONEY IN HIS POCKET AND CLOTHES
  ON HIS BACK.
  WE BROUGHT HIM HOME.
  IT IS THE ATTITUDE WE HAVE TO
  DEAL WITH.
  LET ME THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME
  THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT
  BECAUSE WE ARE FINDING IT IS
  DIFFICULT TO GET THAT MESSAGE
  OUT.
  NEIL: I APPRECIATE YOU COMING
  ON.
  WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL COMING.
  I WANT TO THANK YOU.
  MUCH MORE AFTER THIS.

  NEIL: WE ARE GETTING UPDATED  IMAGES FROM CALIFORNIA, THE 7.1
  MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE, 10 TIMES
  MORE SEVERE THAN THE ONE THAT
  PRECEDED IT.
  JEFF PAUL HAS THE LATEST.
  IN RIDGECREST, CALIFORNIA.
  Reporter: THIS EARTHQUAKE
  WAS FELT FAR AND WIDE.
  WE ARE NEAR THE EPICENTER OF
  THE 7.1 EARTHQUAKE.
  THERE ARE REPORTS OF PEOPLE AS
  FAR NORTH AS SACRAMENTO AND AS
  FAR EAST AS PHOENIX, ARIZONA
  AND AS FAR SOUTH AS MEXICO,
  FEELING SOME SORT OF RUMBLING
  DUE TO THIS PARTICULAR
  EARTHQUAKE RUMBLING AFTER 8:00.
 UCER SHOT, THERE WAS FIRST Y
  A SMALLER AFTERSHOCK THAT WAS
  JUST MINOR BUT A FEW MINUTES
  LATER THAT 7.1 MAGNITUDE
  EARTHQUAKE RUMBLED THROUGH.
  YOU COULD HEAR THINGS CRASHING
  IN THE RESTAURANT.
  YOU COULD HEAR PEOPLE SCREAMING
  AS THEY TRY TO TAKE COVER OR
  ñ■ñ■Y AND SHORTLY AFTER
  THAT IF YOU GOT YOUR WITS ABOUT
  YOU WE STARTED HEARING THE
  SIRENS, OING EVERY
  DIRECTION, AMBULANCES TRYING TO
  RESPOND TO THE FLURRY OF CALLS
  THEY GOT AFTER THIS EARTHQUAKE
  AND FIRE IN THE DI AND AT
  LEAST ONE STRUCTURE DESTROYED
  AND A FEW OTHER FIRES, LIKELY
  DO TO GAS LINE RUPTURES AND A
  BIG PART OF THAT, BECAUSE OF
  THE UNEASINESS OF RESIDENTS
  SOME ARE CHOOSING TO SLEEP
  OUTSIDE, WE CAUGHT UP WITH ONE
  RESIDENT, HOW SHE IS LIVING HER
  LIFE MOVING FORWARD.
  TAKE A LISTEN.
  IF IT HAPPENS IT HAPPENS BUT
  I'M NOT GOING TO SIT AROUND AND
  NOT DO ANYTHING.@
  I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT, JUST
  GOING TO GET ON WITH LIFE AND
  IF IT HITS IT HITS.
  THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO
  STOP IT, NOTHING I CAN DO TO
  FOREWARN ME SO I GOT TO KEEP
  BUSY SO I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
  THERE WILL BE MORE  AFTERSHOCKS AND THERE'S A
  CHANCE THERE COULD BE AN EVEN
  BIGGER EARTHQUAKE ON THE WAY.
  HEATHER: BE SAFE YOUR SELF IN
  THE MIDDLE OF THAT.
  YOUR KEEPING AN EYE ON IRAN
  WHICH THREATENED TO RETALIATE,
  ONE OF ITS TAKERS SEIZED BY THE
  BRITISH, SEEING A BRITISH
  TANKER.

     <i> This is the couple who</i>       <i> wanted to get away</i>
    <i> who used Expedia to book</i>
       <i> the vacation rental</i>
   <i> which led to the discovery</i>
         <i> that sometimes</i>

         Let's be honest,
       you only talk about         your insurance
   when you complain about it.
  (garbled)....it's so painful.
           Good point!
  That's why Esurance is making      the whole experience
      surprisingly painless.
        So, you never have        to talk about it.
      surprisingly painless.       Unless you're their          spokesperson.
   Esurance. It's surprisingly            painless.
  ALL RIGHT. FAST MOVING DEVELOPMENTS ON IRAN
 RIGHT NOW.
 IT'S DEMANDING THE UNITED
 KINGDOM RELEASE THE OIL TANKER
 IT SEIZED I BELIEVE IN
 GIBRALTER.
 AND THEY WILL NOT TALK.
 AND COMMANDER, THE SOON TO BE
 OUT GOING PRIME MINISTER,
 THERESA MAY, TO WHATEVER IRAN IS
 PLANNING AND PUSHING FOR THE
 FULL DENUCLEARIZATION.
 AND JUDGING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
 YOU KNOW THIS REGION VERY, VERY
 WELL AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE
 IRANIANS MIGHT BE CONSIDERING.
 THEY'RE NOT AVERSE TO SEIZING
 PERSONNEL OF THE REGION AS THEY
 DID BACK IN 2007, WHEN THEY
 STORMED THE BRITISH FRIGATE AND
 I BELIEVE HELD ABOUT A DOZEN MEN
 AND WOMEN CAPTIVE FOR A WHILE
 BEFORE RELEASING THEM.
 THEY'RE UP TO THAT AND
 APPARENTLY ITCHING TO DO THAT OR
 THE SAME KIND OF THING, WHAT DO
 YOU THINK?
 I THINK, NEIL, THE
 SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN THE
 FACT THAT THE BRITISH DECIDED TO
 SEIZE THIS TANKER.
 CLEARLY, IT WAS IN VIOLATION,
 NOT JUST OF U.S. SANCTIONS, BUT
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, EU SANCTIONS
 WITH THAT OIL HEADED TOWARDS
 SYRIA.
 THAT OIL TANKER CARRIES TWO
 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL WHICH
 EQUATES TO ABOUT 84 MILLION
 GALLONS.
 THAT WAS HUGE FOR THE SYRIAN
 REGIME TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT
 ITSELF AND THE FACT THAT IT'S
 CUT OFF IS GOOD.
 WHAT ION RAH DOES NEXT, I THINK
 THEY SHOULD CHOOSE VERY WISELY
 BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO
 ACCIDENTALLY START SOMETHING
 THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP OR
 CONTROL.
 NEIL: ALL RIGHT, WE UNDERSTAND,
 I MIGHT HAVE MISSPOKE,
 COMMANDER, THAT THIS
 CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE
 PRESIDENT AND THERESA MAY WAS
 ACTUALLY YESTERDAY.
 THE DETAILS ABOUT IT ARE ONLY
 COMING TO LIGHT TODAY, BUT THEY
 DID TALK ABOUT SHARED INTEREST
 IN ENFORCING SANCTIONS ON SYRIA
 TO ENSURE THAT IRAN DOESN'T
 OBTAIN A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
 WITH THE IRANIANS READY TO
 EXCEED PRODUCTION, THAT WOULD
 MAKE SUCH A THING MORE LIKELY,
 THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION.
 WELL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT,
 IRAN IS GETTING SQUEEZED, MUCH
 QUICKER AND HARSHER THAN
 ANTICIPATED WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
 PUT THE SANCTIONS BACK INTO
 PLACE.
 IF THEY BREAK THE CAP THEY CLAIM
 THEY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE
 AMOUNT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE
 FOR ENRICHED URANIUM, THEY'RE IN
 VIOLATION OF THE AGREEMENT.
 THAT NOW MOVES THINGS INTO A
 DIFFERENT CATEGORY, AND THERE IS
 A LETTER BY SENATORS CRUZ AND
 RUBIO AND I BELIEVE ONE OTHER,
 NOW THAT THEY VIOLATE THAT
 AGREEMENT WE'RE NOW INTO THE
 U.N. CATEGORY WHERE THE
 SNAP-BACK SANCTIONS CAN NOW COME
 INTO PLACE.
 THIS IS NOW ENGAING THE WHOLE
 WORLD.
 IRAN IS NOT JUST AGAINST THE
 U.S. AT THIS POINT, THEY'RE NOW
 AGAINST THE WORLD.
 WHEN IRAN IS DOING THAT, THEY'RE
 GOING TO FIND THEMSELVES
 INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, NOT JUST
 FROM THE U.S. ABOUT YOU ALSO OUR
 EUROPEAN ALLIES ARE GOING TO
 REALIZE THEY NEED TO NOT ONLY
 SUPPORT THE U.S., BUT MORE
 IMPORTANTLY, SUPPORT THE U.N. IN
 WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ENSURE THAT
 IRAN NEVER DEVELOPS THAT WEAPONS
 CAPABILITY.
 AND EVERYONE IS WAITING TO
 SEE WHAT THEY'LL DO IN
 RESPONDENT TO THIS MOVE.
 I MENTIONED IN 2007, SEIZING OF
 THAT THE IRANIAN CLAIMS WASN'T
 IN INTERNATIONAL WATER, WHEN IT
 COMES TO THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ OR
 ANYTHING CLOSE, THEY STATE THAT
 THAT'S THEIR LAND, OR THEIR
 WATER.
 HOW DID YOU LOOK AT
 INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS 12 MILES
 FROM A SHORE IS EVERYBODY'S
 WATER.
 IT'S INTERNATIONAL WATERWAYS,
 AND RECOGNIZED UNDER NANE
 INTERNATIONAL LAW.
 WHILE THE IRANIANS MAKE THAT
 CLAIM, THERE'S NO WEIGHT WHEN IT
 COMES TO THAT INTERNATIONAL
 STANDARD.
 PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
 TRANSIT THAT WATERWAY AND IF
 IRAN DOES INTERFERE WITH IT,
 THEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
 AT THAT POINT HAVE AN OBLIGATION
 TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES,
 DIPLOMATICALLY, ECONOMICALLY AND
 IF NECESSARILY, MILITARILY TO
 ENSURE THAT THE WATERWAY IS OPEN
 FOR THE PRE TRANSIT OF OIL TO
 KEEP THE ECONOMIES GOING.
 COMMANDER, THANK YOU VERY,
 VERY MUCH, GOOD CHATTING WITH
 YOU AGAIN.
 AS ALWAYS, NEIL.
 THANK YOU.
 WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ABOUT
 THE 2020 RACE, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
 KNEE DEEP IN FUND RAISING AND A
 LOT KNEE DEEP IN CASH, WHO HAS
 THE MOST?
 IT'S A LITTLE EARLY IN THE
 PROCESS, BUT NEVER TOO EARLY TO
 START PICKING UP THE NUMBERS AND
 GILLIAN TURNER WITH THE LATEST.
 GOOD MORNING, NEIL.
 THE COMPETITION FOR FUNDS, AS
 YOU SAID, IS STUFF THIS ELECTION
 CYCLE AND IT'S TIGHTER AMONG THE
 TOP TIER DEMOCRATS DURING THE
 SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR
 ACCORDING TO THE NEW NUMBERS.
 CANDIDATES ARE ON DEADLINE TO
 REPORT BY JULY 15TH, BUT MOST
 MADE IT IN UNDER THE GUN.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
 SO FAR PETE BUTTIGIEG COMES IN
 TOPS AT 24.8 MILLION DOLLARS IN
 HAUL.
 JOE BIDEN UP NEXT WITH 21.5
 MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN BERNIE
 SANDERS WITH 18 MILLION,
 FOLLOWED BY KAMALA HARRIS WITH
 12 MILLION.
 AFTER HARRIS THOUGH THE DROP-OFF
 IS PRETTY STEEP.
 MICHAEL BENNETT NEXT WITH A 2.8
 MILLION DOLLAR HAUL.
 AND SAYS, HE'S FEELING THE HEAT.
 I HAVEN'T BEEN RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT FOR A LONG TIME.
 I JUST GOT IN THE RACE SO WHAT
 I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS MAKING
 SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO RAISE
 THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO BE ABLE
 TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE EARLY
 STATES OF IOWA AND NEW
 HAMPSHIRE.
 SO THESE NUMBERS MATTER,
 NEIL, BECAUSE THE CANDIDATES
 WILL ALL NEED EVERY DOLLAR THEY
 CAN GET IN ORDER TO MAKE IT TO
 ROUND TWO.
 THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC DEBATES ARE
 COMING UP SOON.
 THE OTHER THING THAT MATTERS
 HERE, POPULARITY.
 BIDEN STILL TEN POINTS AHEAD OF
 HIS DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES EVEN
 AFTER FALLING A LITTLE IN THE
 POLLS AFTER THE LAST DEBATE LAST
 WEEK.
 NEIL.
 THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.
 WE'RE KEEPING TRACK WHERE THE
 CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO BE.
 JOE BIDEN, WE UNDERSTAND IS
 GOING TO SPEND A GOOD CHUNK OF
 TIME IN SOUTH CAROLINA,
 CONSIDERED A MUST-WIN FOR HIM TO
 STABILIZE THE CAMPAIGN THAT'S
 BEEN BUFFETED LATELY.
 SENATOR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
 GOOD MORNING, NEIL, GOOD TO
 BE BACK WITH YOU.
 JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE IN
 YOUR BEAUTIFUL STATE TODAY.
 HE'S TALKED TO THE PRESS SINCE
 THAT DEBATE WHERE HE'S BEEN SORT
 OF UNIVERSALLY PANNED.
 HE CAN RIGHT THE SHIP.
 HE'S LOOKING FORWARD, NOT
 LOOKING BACKWARD.
 HOW DOES HE LOOK IN YOUR STATE
  DEMOCRATIC
 YOU KNOW, FOR MY FRIEN ON■■■

 ANççççççççççççççççççççççççççççç
 AGAIN, JOE  ESPECIALLY
 A RACIAL ISSUE LIKE BUSING, HAS
 PROMPTED MORE FOLKS TO START
 TAKING A SECOND LOOK AT HER AND
 SHE IS NOW GAINING WHAT'S BEEN
 THE STATE--
 SHE'S BEEN BEHIND IN THE
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHICH
 IS QUITE UNUSUAL AND
 INTERESTING, AND JOE BIDEN'S
 LEGACY AS A FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT
 OF THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 PRESIDENT HAS SERVED HIM WELL,
 BUT THOSE NUMBERS ARE STARTING
 TO SHOW A LOT OF CRACKS.
 YOU KNOW, AS YOU'VE REMINDED
 ME IN THE PAST, I THOUGHT YOU
 WERE TALKING ABOUT SOUTH
 CAROLINA IN YOUR PRIDE OF BEING
 A SENATOR THERE.
 BUT IT'S TURNED A LOT TO RACISM
 IN THE PAST, THERE THAT GEORGE


 TO THE RACE IN THE PAST, AND
 THERE THAT GEORGE BUSH, AND JOHN
 MCCAIN, PUTTING HIM ASIDE IN
 SOUTH CAROLINA, WE SAW SOMETHING
 SIMILAR WITH BARACK OBAMA, A
 CANDIDATE WHO HAD TO WIN AT THAT
 TIME.
 I'M WONDERING IF IT'S A SIMILAR
 THIS GO ROUND?
 I'M CALLING IT THE MOMENTUM,
 THE FIRST, IN THE PRIMARY STATE,
 SOUTH CAROLINA, PROVEN TO BE THE
 SPRINGBOARD FOR PRESIDENTIAL
 SUCCESS ON THE RIGHT AS WELL AS
 THE LEFT.
 AND I THINK BACK SINCE 1980,
 SOUTH CAROLINANS HAVE CHOSEN ON
 THE REPUBLICANS SIDE AND ON THE
 DEMOCRATIC SIDE, A LOT OF
 SUCCESS AS WELL.
 I THINK THAT SOUTH CAROLINA IS
 POISED TO MAKE THE DECISION FOR
 THE DEMOCRATS THIS CYCLE.
 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
 WHO THEY CHOOSE.
 I STILL THINK THEY'RE A LONG
 WAY, OF COURSE, FROM 2020, BUT
 IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO
 SEE WHO WILL STAND TOE TO TOE
 WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 I LIKE OUR ODDS RIGHT NOW, BY
 THE WAY.
 WE'RE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION,
 OUR ECONOMY IS STRONG EAR
 INTERNATIONAL AND NO DOUBT WHEN
 YOU LOOK AT THE 2020 ELECTION,
 IT'S GOING TO BE A STRONG,
 POWERFUL MATCH-UP.
 RIGHT NOW I'M EXCITED WHERE WE
 ARE.
 NEIL: SENATOR, IT'S EARLY AND
 YOU REMIND ME IT'S VERY EARLY SO
 DON'T GET FIXATED ON POLLS.
 GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE
 ECONOMY AND THE UNEXPECTED
 224,000 JOB SURGE IN THE LATEST
 MONTH AND MARKETS IN AND OUT OF
 ALL-TIME HIGHS, THAT THE
 PRESIDENT ISN'T BENEFITTING MORE
 FROM THAT.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING?
 WELL, WE'RE AT A VERY
 POLARIZED PLACE FROM A POLITICAL
 PERSPECTIVE CALLED AMERICA.
 IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING FOR A VERY
 LONG TIME, IT'S BEEN GETTING
 WORSE INCREMENTALLY.
 THERE'S NO DOUBT WE'VE HAD
 DISTRACTIONS FROM WHAT SHOULD
 BE, IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID.
 THE PROGRESS HE'S MADE, AND
 ESPECIALLY IN THE FRAGILE
 ECONOMIC AMERICANS, WE WOULD BE
 CELEBRATED 6 MILLION JOBS
 CREATED SINCE THE TAX REFORM.
 HALF HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS.
 WE HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE, BUT
 THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY
 DISTRACTIONS THAT IF YOU FOCUS
 ON■■■ATTERSVERAGE
 WHAT'S MYbs■@sbsUCbs
 IN THIS OMY?
 CAN MY KIDSXP BETTER

 BUT THE NARE HEAR RT CONSISTENTLY HAS NOT RE WITH TH
 THAT  UNFORTUNATELY,

 WE'VE SE PRO

  M
 FIRSTS THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN.
 WE SHOULD BE EXCITED TO BE
 AMERICANS AND WE SHOULD BE
 EXCITED TO BE AMERICANS RIGHT
 NOW IN 2019 AND THERE'S SO MANY
 DISTRACTIONS, TRYING TO DIVIDE
 US.
 BECAUSE, IF WE STAND UNITED WE
 WIN.
 IF WE ARE DIVIDED, WE ARE IN
 JEOPARDY.
 I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET OUR
 ACT TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT
 THE LEFT HAS BEEN SELLING A
 RHETORIC AS IF IT WERE REALITY
 AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
 DISCERN THE DIFFERENCE AND
 CREATE THE CONTRAST SO THAT THE
 AVERAGE AMERICANS, WHETHER THEY
 VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS OR NOT,
 THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION.
 IS AMERICA BETTER OFF UNDER THE
 CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES AND
 POLICIES PUT IN PLACE?
 THE ANSWER IS RESOUNDINGLY YES.
 NEIL: BUT DO YOU THINK THE
 PRESIDENT RISKS TORPEDOING THIS
 WITH THE ONGOING TRADE RIFT WITH
 CHINA.
 THE TARIFFS HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
 TO KICK IN.
 SO MANY ON STORE SHELVES.
 THEY WERE GOING TO KICK IN.
 THE IMPACT HASN'T BEEN FELT.
 AND THE PRESIDENT ARGUES HE
 LIKES TARIFFS ANYWAY, AVERAGE
 AMERICANS PAY THOSE TARIFFS AND
 I'M WONDERING IF YOU FEEL HE'S
 OUT OF STEP WITH THAT OR OUT OF
 SINK WITH THAT AND IT'S GOING TO
 COST HIM?
 WELL, I'D LIKE TO BREAK THE
 TARIFF CONVERSATION INTO
 MULTIPLE CATEGORIES.
 YOU THINK ABOUT CHINA.
 CHINA'S GOAL IS TO STEAL THE
 FUTURE WHICH WOULD  IMPERIL
 AMERICA'S PROGRESS.
 THIS IS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN
 OUR WORK FORCE AND TO CREATE THE
 BEST FUTURE GOING FORWARD FROM A

 TECHNOLOGICAL STANDPOINT.
 THEIR GOAL WITH THE INTELLECTUAL
 THEFT--
 DO YOU THINK THAT TARIFFS ARE
 A GOOD THING, PERIOD.
 IF IT DOESN'T SETTLE IT'S GOING
 TO BOOMERANG ON REPUBLICANS?
 WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE
 SIX OR SEVEN STATES, THE WAGE
 GAUGE, THAT TARIFFS COULD PUT IN
 JEOPARDY.
 THEIR WAGE GROWTH HAS
 OUTSTRIPPED THE WAGE GROWTH.
 SOME HAD 4, 5, 6% WAGE GROWTH.
 THAT'S EXCITING ESPECIALLY IN
 THOSE SECTORS.
 THE TRUTH IS THE OVERALL TARIFF
 CONVERSATION IS NOT IN THE
 OVERALL INTEREST OF MOST
 AMERICANS, NO QUESTION.
 I PUT THE AS SISTER  -- ASTERISK
 WHEN YOU PUT IT OUT THERE WE
 HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T GO
 TOO FAR, THE 232 AUTO TARIFF IS
 A CLASSIC EXAMPLE WHERE I HAVE
 PUSHED BACK BECAUSE I THINK IT
 CREATES HEADWINDS THROUGHOUT THE
 SOUTH.
 NEIL: ALWAYS A PLEASURE CATCHING
 UP WITH YOU.
 BE WELL.
 ALL RIGHT.
 NEIL: SENATOR SCOTT OUT OF SOUT
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION BAC20■■ CE
 IS THAT EVEN LEGAL AFTER THIS?

        BEING DETECTED WAS          NOT AN OPTION.
       IF I WAS RECOGNIZED
       THE WHOLE OPERATION            WAS BLOWN.
          THE ELEMENT OF     SURPRISE WAS IMPERATIVE.
        WOW. HE WON'T EVEN          RECOGNIZE YOU.
        SERIOUSLY. I DON'T      EVEN RECOGNIZE MYSELF.
         AND THANKS TO MY     CASHREWARDS CREDIT CARD
        FROM NAVY FEDERAL   WITH NEVER-EXPIRING REWARDS
          IT'S GONNA BE       A KILLER HONEYMOON.
               WOO!              MAUI!!
               BOOM
 VY FEDERAL CREDIT UNIOqOqO
          OUR MEMBERS,         ARE THE MISSION.
  AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE CENSUS?
 WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING
 THAT.
 THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS.
 THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE WAYS TO
 DO IT.
 WE CAN ADD ON AN ADDITION.
 PRINTING NOW AND ADD AN ADDENDUM
 AFTER WE GET A POSITIVE
 DECISION.
 WE'RE WORKING ON A LOT OF
 THINGS, INCLUDING AN EXECUTIVE
 ORDER.
 NEIL: THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING
 FOR WAYS HE'S ADDING THE
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION AFTER ALL
 INCLUDING AS HE SAID AN
 EXECUTIVE ORDER.
 WILL IT HOLD UP IN COURT?
 WHO BETTER TO PICK IT APART THAN
 ATTORNEY EXTRAORDINARE,
 MERCEDES.
 NEIL.
 NEIL: THE SUPREME COURT DIDN'T
 REJECT THE ARGUMENT AS MUCH AS
 SAY THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH
 THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T
 GIVE IT A COMPELLING ENOUGH
 CASE.
 AND DIDN'T GIVE THE
 EXPLANATION.
 I'M HEADED BACK TO 2013.
 THERE WAS A SIMILAR CASE HAVING
 TO DO.
 IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS,
 BUT THAT LAW.
 THE CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SAID
 WE'RE GOING TO STEP AWAY.
 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING
 TO STEP AWAY AND LET THE STATES
 DEAL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE
 PROCESS AND THEY CAN DEAL AT THE
 LOCAL LEVEL.
 BASICALLY THE GOVERNANCE OF THE
 FEDERAL PART STEPPED BACK.
 NOW, 2019.
 NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPS
 IN AND SAYS, HEY, WE WANT TO
 HELP WITH RESPECT TO THE VOTING
 RIGHTS ACT, WHICH, WHAT IT DID
 WAS MADE SURE THAT THE
 INDIVIDUALS COULD VOTE,
 REGARDLESS OF DISCRIMINATION.
 SO THEY NEED TO GO BACK DECADES
 AGO.
 IT STARTED WITH ALLOWING
 INDIVIDUALS TO VOTE REGARDLESS
 OF THEIR RACE.
 NOW, SO THE CHIEF JUSTICE
 ROBERTS SAYS, WHY ARE YOU GOING
 BACK TO THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
 LET THE STATES DEAL WITH IT.
 WHY ARE THEY STEPPING IN IN 2019
 AND WE'RE GOING TO ASSIST IN THE
 PROMULGATION OF THE VOTING
 RIGHTS ACT AP MAKE SURE THERE'S
 NO DISCRIMINATION AND MAKE SURE
 THAT THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A
 HIGH NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT
 ARE OF COLOR HAVE THE
 APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF
 REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS.
 WHEN WE'VE ALREADY RULED THAT
 THE STATES CAN DEAL WITH IT.
 SO WHAT KIND OF COMPELLING
 ARGUMENT DID THEY NEED TO MAKE
 TO WIN OVER THIS PARTICULAR
 JUDGE WHO ASKED TO BE RIGHT
 OVER.
 WE WANT THEM TO LOOK AT THE
 DISTRICTING.
 IT'S NOT DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE
 WE KNOW, CHIEF JUDGE, YOU RULED
 ON LETTING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
 RULE ON THIS.
 WE'RE LOOKING FOR APPROPRIATE
 LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION.
 AND IF WE LOOK AT THE DISTRICTS,
 A LOT OF G.O.P. MEMBERS HAVE
 WROTE ABOUT IN OP-ED.
 WHY DON'T YOU COME FORWARD AND
 SAY WE MIGHT NEED THIS, GREATER
 NUMBERS OF REPRESENTATION.
 IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE GREATER
 NUMBERS OF REPRESENTATION IN
 CONGRESS OR LESS, WE NEED TO
 KNOW HOW MANY U.S. CITIZENS ARE
 IN PARTICULAR JURISDICTIONS
 AROUND THE COUNTRY.
 NEIL: SO WHY WASN'T THERE--
 IT WAS TAKEN OUT.
 THERE USED TO BE A STAPLE IN THE
 CENSUS AND IT WAS TAKEN OUT BY
 THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND I
 DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY SAYING
 BOO THEN.
 THE CHIEF JUDGE WANTS TO SAY,
 YES, IT WAS ABOUT DISTRICTING.
 AND IT'S NOT JUST THE
 DISTRICTING ISSUE WITH YOU
 INFRASTRUCTURE.
 980 BILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE GOING
 TO GIVE AROUND THE COUNTRY.
 NEIL: AND SOMETHING SINISTER
 AFOOT HERE, THEY WANT TO PROVE
 OR DISPROVE THAT.
 ESPECIALLY WITH THE VOTING
 RIGHTS ACT.
 WE GET THE SAME JUDGE.
 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
 CAN I SAY A QUICK HI TO MY
 MOM, HI, ROSALYN.
 HI, MOM.
 SHE'S AMAZING.
 NEIL: AND A FORMER DIRECTOR, HIS
 READ ON THIS AND WHAT IT MEANS
 IF THE PRESIDENT CAN'T GET THIS
 QUESTION IN AFTER THIS.

  ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT TOM HOLMAN HERE, THE
 FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR.
 HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
 THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TO GO
 THROUGH WITH THE DEPORTATIONS.
 MORE IN A SEC.
 I WANT TOM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
 MERCEDES WAS TALKING ABOUT
 REGARDING THE QUESTION IN THE
 CENSUS THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS
 TO PUSH BY EXECUTIVE ORDER TO
 MAKE SURE YOU CAN STILL ASK, ARE
 YOU A LEGAL CITIZEN OF THE
 UNITED STATES.
 WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS IS
 GOING, TOM?
 I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION
 SUCCEEDS IN IT FOR A COUPLE OF
 REASONS.
 NUMBER ONE, DON'T WE WANT TO
 KNOW HOW MANY ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE
 IN THE UNITED STATES?
 AND IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
 IMMIGRATION REFORM, FREE MEDICAL
 CARE, YOU KNOW, PATH WAYS TO
 CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE HERE
 ILLEGALLY FOR A WHILE.
 DON'T WE WANT TO KNOW WHO THAT
 POPULATION IS?
 I WOULD THINK THAT'S A WAY TO
 MAKE EASY DECISION.
 I DON'T THINK THAT
 REPRESENTATIONS IN THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES OR ELECTORAL
 COLLEGE THAT ELECTS OUR
 PRESIDENT SHOULD BE BASED ON
 PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY.
 I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR A COUPLE
 OF REASONS.
 NEIL: SO, LET ME SWITCH GEARS A
 LITTLE BIT HERE.
 REGARDLESS HOW THAT WORKS.
 THE ADMINISTRATION STILL SAYS,
 IT'S GOING TO PURSUE THESE
 DEPORTATIONS, LEGAL
 DEPORTATIONS, THE KIND THAT WENT
 UNDER BARACK OBAMA IN CASES
 ALREADY ADJUDICATED AND ASK THAT
 YOU GO BACK TO MEXICO, HONDURAS,
 GUATEMALA, WHEREVER.
 IT'S GOING TO START SOON, AND
 THE PRESIDENT WILL INDICATE HOW
 SOON.
 HOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO
 GO?
 LOOK, IT'S GOING TO BE
 CONTROVERSIAL, BUT I THINK IT
 NEEDS TO BE DONE.
 IT'S NOT A QUESTION SHOULD IT BE
 DONE, IT HAS TO BE DONE.
 AS YOU SAID, NEIL, I DID THIS
 WHEN I WAS THE EXECUTIVE
 ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT ICE.
 I RAN A0■■■■■óstvós■v■  N■v<n<■M

 THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCE WHO CAN
 COME IN LEGALLY.
 NEIL: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH
 SANCTUARY CITIES, TOWNS OR
 STATES?
 THEY'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
 TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FEDS CAN'T
 GET IN THERE.
 WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
 STOP THE FEDS FROM DOING THEIR
 JOBS.
 THEY CANNOT ASSIST, OR THEY CAN
 DO WHAT THE OAKLAND MAYOR DID
 AND GIVE THEM A HEADS-UP, ICE IS
 IN TOWN.
 NEIL: THAT'S ILLEGAL, THE
 HEADS-UP IS AN ILLEGAL ACT,
 RIGHT?
 KNOW THE ONLY THAT, BUT YOU
 HAD A CONGRESSMAN THE OTHER DAY,
 OCASIO-CORTEZ TALKING ABOUT
 PEOPLE TAKING THEM INTO THEIR
 HOMES.
 AND ICE -- THESE PEOPLE HAD DUE
 PROCESS THROUGH TAXPAYER EXPENSE
 AND ORDERED BOO  BY A JUDGE TO
 GO HOME AND IF YOU AND I IGNORED
 AN ORDER, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
 IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN, THEY
 MIGHT AS WELL OPEN IT UP,
 BECAUSE WE HAVE NO SOVEREIGNTY.
 IF PEOPLE WANT TO STEP IN THE
 WAY OF ICE, LOOK FURTHER.
 IT'S A CRIME TO IMPEDE FEDERAL
 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
 NEIL: THE LAW IS ON YOUR SIDE,
 NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT, IMAGES CAN
 PLAY HAVOC IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
 AND THE REASON I'M THINKING, I'M
 HOLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE
 ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE WHEN HE WAS
 SEIZED FROM A HOME AND
 ULTIMATELY SENT BACK TO CUBA AND
 IT WAS THOSE IMAGES, LEGAL AS
 THEY WERE, TO RETRIEVE HIM, THAT
 STUCK IN AMERICAN'S HEADS DURING
 THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.
 THAT'S GOING TO BE INEVITABLE,
 THE IMAGE OF ICE AGENTS, RAMMING
 ON DOORS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE,
 ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ARRESTED, YOU
 HAVE TO GO BACK.
 HOW IS THAT ALL GOING TO GO
 DOWN?
 LOOK, I THINK FOR THOSE
 PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PUSH THAT
 MESSAGE, I THINK YOU NEED TO ASK
 ONE QUESTION, WHAT IS YOUR
 OPTION?
 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
 BECAUSE IF THERE'S NO INTEGRITY
 IN THE SYSTEM, IF PEOPLE CAN

 LAW, IT'S SAVING LIFE.
 31% OF WOMEN ARE RAPED, CHILDREN
 ARE DYING.
 WE'VE GOT TO SEND THE MESSAGE
 IT'S NOT OKAY.
 CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE
 SMUGGLING THE PEOPLE.
 IT'S ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND
 TAKING MONEY OUT OF CRIMINAL
 ORGANIZATIONS HANDS.
 AND AS SAD AS ENFORCING THE LAW
 IS, IT DOESN'T MEAN WE IGNORE
 IT.
 NEIL: AND I'D BE REMISS IF I
 DIDN'T MENTION THE FACEBOOK
 POSTINGS OF THE PRESIDENT, AND
 WORKERS, WHO IT DISPARAGING
 COMMENTS THEY MADE ABOUT THOSE
 WHO THEY WERE PROTECTING AT
 THESE FACILITIES OR THOSE WHO
 VISITED THEM.
 DO YOU BELIEVE IF IT'S PROVEN
 THAT MANY OF THEM SAID THE
 THINGS THEY ALLEGED TO HAVE
 SAID, THAT THEY SHOULD BE
 TERMINATED?
 I'LL WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE
 INVESTIGATION SHOWS.
 FROM MY SOURCES, ONLY SEVERAL
 PEOPLE THAT POSTED THINGS TO
 THAT EXTREME, AND OF COURSE,
 THEY NEED TO BE DEALT WITH.
 THAT'S NOT THE WAY, THAT'S NOT
 THE BORDER PATROL I KNOW AND I
 THINK IT DETRACTS FROM THE FINE
 WORK THAT BORDER PATROL ARE
 DOING.
 AT WHAT POINT WHEN YOU GO TO
 WORK EVERY DAY YOU'RE CALLED A
 NAZI, A RACIST AND MAKING WOMEN
 DRINK OUT OF TOILETS, WHICH IS
 TOTAL CRAP, AND WHEN YOU GO TO
 WORK EVERY DAY AND HEAR THESE
 THINGS EVERY DAY AND WHAT POINT
 DOES YOUR SPIRIT GET BROKEN AND
 DO THINGS YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
 HAVE DONE.
 I'M NOT MAKING EXCUSE, THE MEN
 AND WOMEN OF BORDER PATROL ARE
 DOING A GOOD JOB AND THE VAST
 MAJORITY OF THEM ARE DOING THIS
 FOR THEIR NATION--
 GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
 TO SHOW THIS IS A WORLDWIDE
 PROBLEM, THOSE WHO TRIED TO FLEE
 TO SAFER SHORES, A BOAT WITH 40
 MIGRANTS ABOARD DOCKED AGAINST
 AN EXPLICIT BAN ON REFUGEES.
 IN ISN'T JUST IN THIS COUNTRY,
 FOLKS.
 THIS IS WORLDWIDE.
 MORE AFTER THIS.
                   ■Eis no catch.
        Yeah the only catch       is I'm never leaving.

 WERE YOU PREPARED FOR THEM TO
 COME AFTER YOU?
 I WAS PREPARED FOR THEM
 COMING AFTER ME.
 BUT I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THE
 PERSON COMING AFTER ME THE WAY
 SHE DID.
 NEIL: AND JOE BIDEN TALKING
 ABOUT THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE AND
 KAMALA HARRIS GOING TOO FAR BACK
 TO A BUSING ISSUE IN THE 1970'S.
 HIS CRITICS ARE QUESTIONING, IF
 HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR THAT, IS
 HE PREPARED FOR THE PRESIDENCY
 AT ALL.
 AND SO, LAUREN, LET ME ASK YOU,
 IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF
 EXCUSE MAKING.
 LOOK, I THINK YOU KNOW, YOU
 ASKED TWO QUESTIONS, IS HE
 PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT?
 HE CERTAINLY IS INCREDIBLY
 QUALIFIED, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW
 YOU GET TO BE PRESIDENT.
 THE FACT IS THERE ARE 25
 CANDIDATES WHO ARE COMING AFTER
 HIM SITTING AT THE TOP OF THE
 POLLS, IT'S NOT A GREAT PLACE TO
 BE EARLY ON, BECAUSE IT OPENS UP
 A MILLION DOORS TO SCRUTINIZE
 EVERY PIECE OF HIS RECORDS.
 YOUNGER VOTERS ARE PAYING CLOSE
 ATTENTION, YOUNGER VOTERS AND
 WOMEN.
 NEIL: HAS HE LOST THEM?
 NO HE HASN'T LOST THEM.
 BUT HE'LL HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM
 IF HE DOESN'T TURN IT AROUND.
 AND KAMALA HARRIS AND OTHERS ARE
 OPENING UP, FOR MINORITY VOTERS,
 WOMEN VOTERS, HE'S POLLING WELL
 IN SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT I THINK
 SHE WANTS TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT
 AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY SHE WENT
 AFTER HIM ONA PARTICULAR
 ISSUE.
 NEIL: JOSEPH, IIGHT HAVE
 MISSED THIS, THE PRESIDENT
 HASN'T MADE MUCH ABOUT KAMALA
 HARRIS, NORMALLY IT COULD MEAN
 HE'S WORRIED, OR HOPING THAT JOE
 BIDEN HAS RIGHTED THE SHIP
 BECAUSE HE HAS THE MONIKERS,

 SEGREGATED THAN JIM CSOUTH.
 THIS WOMAN WHO IS A SENATOR WHO
 I HAVE RESPECT FOR CAME OUT WITH
 AN ATTACK ON AN ISSUE SHE
 BASICALLY AGREED WITH ME ON FOR
 THE PURPOSE OF SELLING T-SHIRTS.
 AND JUST NOT TO BE ARED--
 WHETHER YOU PAL AROUND WITH
 SEGREGATIONISTS, BUT THE BUS
 THING.
 WHAT WAS HE DOING?
 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,■■ ■í■í■í■
 EN THERE MORE
 LATELY, ORE DEBATE HE
 WASN'T MAKING PUBLIC
 APPEARANCES, HE WASN'T PREPAREDí
 I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS WATCHING
 CAT VIDEOS ON THE INTERNET,   ■
 CANDY CRUSH, I DON'T KNOW.
 NEIL: WOULDN'T&; BE COOL IF
 HE WAS UP THERE AND ACTUALLY
 ING CANDY CRUSH.
 MAYBE HE'S ADDICT TODAY CANDY
 CRUSH AND THAT'S WHY HE÷ú■ID
 POORLY, I DON'T KNOW.
 BUT I WOULD THINK IF YOU WERE IN
 FRONT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE,
 YOU'D DO YOUR ■■
 IN FAIRNESS, HE HAS A
 LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE.  HE
 ADMITTED HE WASN'T.
 HE CLEARLY HAD A BAD NIGHT.
 THE REALITY IT'S INCREDIBLY TO
 SIT ON TOP OF THE POLL WHEN
 YOU'VE GOT 24 PEOPLE CHASING
 YOU.
 NEIL: LOOK AT JED BUSH AT THE
 TOP OF THE POLLS.
 AND THIS EARLY.
 AND HAD THAT MOMENT.
 THAT'S NOT A GREAT PLACE TO BE
 AND I'VE SAID FROM THE
 BEGINNING, I THINK HIS NUMBERS
 ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FALL
 BEFORE THEY COME BACK UP.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE AN ENORMOUS FIELD
 OF CHOICES AND ISSUES TO
 EXPLORE.
 THERE'S A WHOLE NEW GENERATION
 OF VOTERS WHO DON'T HAVE THE
 HISTORY WITH HIM.
 NEIL: THEY DON'T KNOW IT AND
 LIKE A PASSING SHIP IN THE
 NIGHT.
 THEY DON'T.
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE KEY--
 THE KEY TO THIS ELECTION IS
 NOT JUST ABOUT THE PRIMARY VOTE.
 WHAT'S GOING TO TURN 2020 FOR
 THE DEMOCRATS IS GOING TO BE
 ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY OF NEW
 VOTERS.
 GEN Z, AND GEN Y.
 WOMEN AND PEOPLE--
 LET ME ASK WHERE THEARTY
 LIES AND JOE BIDEN WAS SAYING
 ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, I'LL
 ASK YOU ABOUT THIS, JOE, SHE'S
 BRIGHT AND BRILLIANT, BUT TOO
 FAR LEFT.
 IN OTHER WORDS, SAYING OUR GAINS
 HAVE COME FROM MORE MODERATE
 VICTORIES.
 AND HE'S RIGHT OF THE 40, I
 GUESS ELECTED TO THE HOUSE, I
 THINK 32 FIT THE MODERATE LABEL.
 THAT MIGHT BE
 OVERGENERALLYLIZING IT AND NOT
 THE OCASIO-CORTEZ LABEL.
  SO SAYING THAT DID HE KIND OF
 BURY HIMSELF?
 I THINK HE'S SPEAKING THE
 TRUTH.
 HAVING SAID THAT MIGHT GIVE HIM
 TREPIDATIONS AND DIFFICULTIES
 GETTING THROUGH THE PROCESS.
 THE ONLY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT
 THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY EXPANDING
 LEFT ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN
 DISTRICTS THAT THEY COULD LOSE
 EVEN IF THEY'RE RUNNING
 AGAINST--
 YOU'RE ARGUING THAT HE IS--
 WHEN HE SAYS HE'S WORRIED ABOUT
 THE PARTY MOVING TOO, TOO FAR
 LEFT, PROMISING MEDICARE FOR
 ALL, COLLEGE DEBT, RIGHTS FOR
 ILLEGALS AND THAT THAT ISN'T IN
 SYNC WITH HIS DEMOCRATIC--
 BASICALLY ON THE PULSE OF THE
 PARTY MORE SO THAN AOC IS
 TALKING ABOUT--
 ■I ABOUT THA
 BECAUSE LOOK AT AT THE DEBATES
 HE LOST SO SUPPORT AND ELIZABETH
 WARREN GAINED SUPPORT AND SHE'S
 VERY PROGRESSIVE.
 AND PRIMARY VOTERS TEPID TO BE
 MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN PEOPLE IN
 GENERAL ELECTIONS.
 NEIL: THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS TEND
 TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE.
 TRYING TO RUN A GENERAL
 ELECTION DURING A PRIMARY.
 NEIL: AND HE HASN'T WON IT YET.
 HE HASN'T WON IT AND HE TRIED
 TO EQUIVOCATE ON THAT DURING THE
 CNN INTERVIEW THAT HE DOESN'T
 WANT TO BE PRESUMPTUOUS.
 NEIL: YOU WANT THE DEMOCRAT TO
 WIN, AND COULD YOU BE WORRIED
 ABOUT THINGS THAT PROMISES
 PROPOSAL THAT EVEN THE
 DEMOCRATIC VOTER IN THE COUNTRY
 DOESN'T--
 I DON'T.
 WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE PRIMARY
 IN A PRIMARY LIKE THIS?
 IT'S A BATTLE OF IDEAS, FAR TO
 THE LEFT, SOMEWHERE IN THE
 MIDDLE AND LAND SOMEWHERE MORE
 IN LINE WITH THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE, BUT I THINK IT'S A
 VALUABLE PROCESS, THAT'S WHY I
 DON'T AGREE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE
 ON THE LEFT WHO SAY WE NEED TO
 KULL THE FIELD SO QUICKLY.
 THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THE DUNT
 WHEN YOU'VE GOT QUALIFIED PEOPLE
 DEBATING IDEAS ON THE COUNTRY.
 AND I THINK IT'S BACK TO THE
 CENTER AS WE'RE CLOSER TO THE
 NOMINATION, BUT HE'S WRONG TO
 HOLD THIS--
 HE'S GOING TO ALIENATE A LOT OF
 THE PEOPLE THAT HE REALLY NEEDS
 TO TURN OUT FOR HIM.
 I DISAGREE.
 I THINK YET AGAIN, JOE BIDEN IS
 PLAYING A GAME RIGHT NOW HE
 BELIEVES HE'S GOING TO DEPEND ON
 RELIABLE VOTERS.
 RELIABLE VOTERS ARE OLDER
 VOTERS.
 OLDER BLACK VOTERS, AND THOSE
 ARE THE PEOPLE HE'S TALKING
 ABOUT.
 HE FELL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO A
 GOODB, HE KIND OF SUCKS,
 BUT--
 MAYBE HE'S A LOUSY CANDIDATE.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT ELIZABETH
 WARREN RISING, RISING NOT ON THE
 STRENGTHS OF JOE BIDEN, BUT
 PEOPLE BELIEVE SHE'S THE
 ORIGINAL PERSON WITH THE
 TRILLION DOLLAR GIVEAWAYS, THE
 PLANS TO BERNIE'S RHETORIC.
 AND YOU SEE KAMALA HARRIS GOING
 AFTER JOE BIDEN HER PATH GOES
 DIRECTLY ON JOE BIDEN.
 NEIL: THAT'S AT THE TOP.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ON A
 HOT SATURDAY.
 WE APPRECIATE THAT.

  ALL RIGHT, I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT IS STILL A FAN OF THE
 FEDERAL RESERVE BLASTING IT IN
 TWEETS, IN PART STRONG JOBS
 REPORT AND LOW INFLATION AND
 OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
 DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO
 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED
 STATES KNOWING OUR FEDERAL
 RESERVE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE,
 RAISED RATES TOO SOON, TOO
 OFTEN.
 AND RUBBING MORE SALT IN THE
 WOUND, THE MOST DIFFICULT
 PROBLEM IS NOT OUR COMPETITORS,
 IT'S THE FEDERAL RESERVE.
 JOINING ME THE FORMER FED
 NOMINEE, STEVE MOORE.
 HE WILL NOT LET GO OF THIS.
 IS THAT HURTING HIM?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK.
 LET ME START BY SAYING THIS WHEN
 I WAS DRIVING IN, NEIL, I THINK
 YOU AND I ARE ABOUT THE SAME
 AGE.
 THIS MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEST
 ECONOMY WE'VE SEEN IN OUR
 LIFETIME.
 WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE LOWEST
 UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN 50 YEARS,
 NO INFLATION, RISING WAGES,
 YOU'VE GOT 7 1/2 MILLION MORE
 JOBS THAN PEOPLE TO FILL THEM.
 THE STOCK MARKET IS NOW
 OFFICIALLY UP 50% SINCE DONALD
 TRUMP WAS ELECTED.
 NEIL: HE'S BLAMING FED THAT IT
 COULD BE A LOT HIGHER.
 I HAD NO IDEA WERE YOU 39.
 [LAUGHTER].
 YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN I AM BUT,
 NO, THE REASON I SAY THAT, NE
 TO YOUR TION, ISN'TT ABOUT
 TIME■ ■ ■ ■  THIS
 I REMEMBER DURING ■@■@
 WORKING FOR TRUMP AND PEOPLE
 AVE THE SECOND GRADE■@■ E■÷■÷
 DEPRES
 AND NOW WE HA■@ THE BEST ECONOMY
 IN YEARS.
 HE'S FRUSTRATEDE FED AND
 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS HE
 NOMINATED ME.
 I THINK THE FED IS TOO TIGHT AS
 WELL.
 NEIL: NOW HE'S NAMING TWO
 PEOPLE, THE INTERPRETATION IS
 THAT THEY'LL DO HIS BIDDING,
 THAT THEY AGREE WITH HIM.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 THEY SHARE HIS VISION OF THE
 ECONOMY.
 THE PROBLEM WITH THE FED AND
 THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM NOT
 RECENTLY, BUT FOR 30 YEARS.
 THE FED BELIEVES IF YOU GET TOO
 MUCH INFLATION I MEAN, TOO MANY
 PEOPLE WORKING, TOO MUCH GROWTH,
 WAGES RISING SOMEHOW THEY HAVE
 TO SNUFF THAT OUT.
 AND DONALD TRUMP THE FIRST TIME
 I MET HIM WE ARE GOING TO GET
 THIS ECONOMY MOVING 3 TO 4% UP A
 YEAR FROM OBAMA.
 AND EVERY TIME WE GET A GOOD
 JOBS REPORT OR THE GROWTH COMES
 UP OR WAGES RISE THE FED WANTS
 TO, YOU KNOW, PULL IT BACK.
 AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG-HEADED.
 WE CAN GROW THIS ECONOMY WITHOUT
 INFLATION FASTER AND TRUMP IS
 RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
 NEIL: ARE YOU WORRIED--
 I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING AND
 THE PRESIDENT IS COMING AND HE'S
 PROVEN RIGHT BECAUSE THEY DID GO
 TO 4.
 EXACTLY RIGHT.
 NEIL: HAVING SAID THAT, DOES HE
 RECOGNIZE HOW WEIRD IT SOUNDS TO
 LOVE A ROBUST ECONOMY AND A
 STRONG JOBS AND STILL ADVOCATES
 FOR LOWER RATES?
 IT'S LIKES AN OXYMORON.
 NO, IT ISN'T.
 WE THINK THE ECONOMY CAN GROW
 FASTER.
 WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GET 2%.
 THE ECONOMY SHOULD BE GROWING 3
 TO 4.
 BY THE WAY IF HE GETS THE TRADE
 DEAL WITH CHINA AND THE FED RATE
 CUT IN JULY I THINK YOU'RE
 LOOKING AT--
 IF YOU THINK THE ECONOMY IS
 STRONG, BUT, WAIT UNTIL THAT
 HAPPENS.
 WE HAVE A DIFFERENT MODEL IN
 MIND.
 WE THINK THE CAPACITY OF THE
 U.S. ECONOMY TO GROW FASTER FOR
 MORE JOBS TO BE CREATED, MORE
 PEOPLE IN THE WORK FORCE IS A
 LOT FASTER.
 REMEMBER, LARRY SUMMERS, WHO WAS
 BILL CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA'S
 ECONOMIST, YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE
 ELECTION SAID THE TOP MOST
 GROWTH WE CAN GET IN THIS
 COUNTRY IS 2%.
 REMEMBER THAT.
 NEIL: YOU'RE RIGHT.
 NO, WE'RE THROWING THIS MODEL
