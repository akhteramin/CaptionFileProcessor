 THE PRESIDENT GIVES HIS SECOND STATE OF THE UNION
 ADDRESS WHICH IS A CALL FOR
 UNITY, BUT DEMOCRATS HIT BACK
 SAYING THE PROBLEM WITH UNITY
 IS HIS FAULT.
 WAS THE PRESIDENT RIGHT
 WHEN HE SAID ICE MADE HUNDREDS
 OF ARRESTS?
 FROM RECORD HEAT YESTERDAY
 TO NEEDING A JACKET AND AN
 UMBRELLA TODAY.
 AND ONE STATE IS GOING TO
 EXTREME MEASURES TO CRACK DOWN
 ON SMOKING, BUT DON'T WORRY,
 YOUR BOAT IS SAFE.
 GET UP DC.
 [ MUSIC ] [ APPLAUSE ] GET UP DC, IT
 IS 6:00 AND AN ENCOURAGING 46
 DEGREES RIGHT NOW.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERED HIS
 SECOND STATE OF THE UNION
 ADDRESS LAST NIGHT AND THIS IS
 THE FIRST SINCE DEMOCRATS TOOK
 CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES.
 WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT
 THROUGH THE NEXT HOUR, BUT WE
 STARTED WITH THE UNION, A
 QUESTION.
 DO YOU THINK IT WILL HELP UNITE
 BOTH PARTIES YES OR NO OR IT
 NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
 YOU CAN VOTE ON WUSA9.COM/BOAT
 OR THE  WUSA9 APP.
 I NEED TO ASK YOU, WILL I GET
 TO WEAR MY TANK TOP AGAIN
 TODAY?
 BECAUSE THE  GUN SHOW WAS
 SPARSELY ATTENDED YESTERDAY.
 YOU WILL WANT A JACKET LIKE
 THE ONE YOU ARE WEARING RIGHT
 NOW.
 OUT OF THE DOOR THIS MORNING,
 40s AND 30s, 47 IN, CALL IT A
 WEATHER FLIP-FLOP BECAUSE WE
 HAVE COLDER TEMPERATURES TODAY,
 HIGHS ONLY BETWEEN 48 AND 55
 DEGREES WITH SHOWERS OUT THERE
 AND THE BEST TIME TO SEE THE
 SHOWERS ACROSS METRO DC IS
 GOING TO BE AROUND 5:00 OR SO
 THIS AFTERNOON AND NORTH AND
 WEST OF DC, YOU COULD SEE THE
 SHOWERS AS EARLY AS 2:00.
 2:30 P.M., SHOWERS OVER
 MARTINSBURG AND FREDERICK AND
 6:00 THIS AFTERNOON HAS SHOWERS
 ACROSS METRO DC WITH LIGHT RAIN
 FALLING ACROSS THE AREA.
 THAT WILL LAST US THROUGH AT
 LEAST THE DINNERTIME HOURS.
 ONE OF THE REASONS WE ISSUED
 THE YELLOW WEATHER ALERT, BUT
 WE SEE THE TEMP IS GOING UP AND
 DOWN AND BACK TO THE 60s FOR
 THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH
 SHOWERS AND STRONG COLD FRONT,
 THAT SENDS US DOWN TO 39 FOR
 THE HIGH ON SATURDAY.
 BACK TO REALITY.
 AND WE HAD A CLOSURE ON ROUTE
 5, THAT DOWN IN ST. MARY'S, BUT
 IT'S IN SOUTHBOUND LANES AND IT
 INVOLVES A COMMUTER BUS AND
 UTILITY VEHICLES BY THREE NOTCH
 ROAD, ALL SOUTHBOUND LANES ARE
 CLOSED.
 DC 295 HAS FOUR VEHICLES
 INVOLVED IN THE CRASH BY SOUTH
 CAPITOL STREET.
 ABOUT 28 PASSING BY ROUTE 7
 SOUTHBOUND HAS AN ACCIDENT AS
 WELL.
 KEEP VOTING AND WHETHER YOU
 THINK THE STATE OF THE UNION
 ADDRESS WILL HELP OUR TWO
 POLITICAL PARTIES BRIDGE THE
 DIVIDE.
 MATT GREGORY HAS MORE ON THE
 SPEECH.
 WHAT WERE THE TAKEAWAYS?
 Reporter: ONE OF THE BIG
 TAKEAWAYS WAS THE PRESIDENT
 FIRST CALL FOR UNITY AND USE
 THE SPEECH AS A RALLYING CRY
 FOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS HE'S
 ALREADY DONE AND OTHER ISSUES
 HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN.
 DEMOCRATS HIT BACK SAYING ANY
 LACK OF UNITY IN THE COUNTRY,
 ANY DISCORD COMES FROM THE
 PRESIDENT, HIMSELF.
 HERE ARE THREE THINGS TO KNOW
 FROM THE STATE OF THE UNION AND
 RESPONSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 CALLED FOR CONGRESS TO PASS
 TIGHTER BORDER SECURITY
 MEASURES INCLUDING A CONTINUED
 CALL FOR A BORDER WALL BETWEEN
 THE U.S. AND MEXICO AND THE
 PRESIDENT REVEALED HE WILL HAVE
 ANOTHER MEETING WITH NORTH
 KOREAN PRESIDENT KIM JONG-UN.
 THAT WILL TAKE PLACE FEBRUARY
 27 AND 28 IN VIETNAM AND THE
 GOAL IS TO GET AN AGREEMENT FOR
 DENUCLEARIZATION.
 AND GEORGIA DEMOCRAT STACEY
 ABRAMS BLAMED THE PRESIDENT FOR
 THE DIVISIVENESS IN THE COUNTRY
 AND POINTED TO THE 35 DAY
 PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AS
 AN EXAMPLE OF HIS REFUSAL TO
 COMPROMISE AND HOW THAT HURT
 THE COUNTRY.
 IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT
 THE TEMPORARY FUNDING FOR THE
 PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
 RUNS OUT ON FEBRUARY 15. SO IF
 THE DEMOCRATS AND PRESIDENT
 DON'T COME TO SOME SORT OF
 AGREEMENT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN,
 WE COULD BE HEADING FOR ANOTHER
 PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 WHILE THE SPEECH WAS GOING
 ON, THE VERIFIED TEAM WAS
 CHECKING TO SEE WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT WAS SAYING AND IF IT
 WAS TRUE OR NOT.
 AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT
 OF FACT CHECKING TO DO WITH
 THESE SPEECHES, THE FIRST WE
 ARE LOOKING AT IS ABOUT JOBS.
 AND JUST OVER 2 YEARS SINCE
 THE ELECTION, WE'VE TRADED 5.3
 MILLION NEW JOBS AND IMPORT OF
 THE ADDED 600,000 NEW
 MANUFACTURING JOBS.
 TO GET THE ANSWERS, WENT TO
 THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS
 AND ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU,
 ONCE THE 2017 INAUGURATION, THE
 ECONOMY ADDED 4.9 MILLION NEW
 JOBS, NOT 5.3, SO THAT CLAIM IS
 FALSE.
 TRUMP SAID SINCE THE ELECTION,
 IF YOU ADD THE MONTH SINCE
 NOVEMBER, THAT ADDS UP TO 5.3
 MILLION, BUT BECAUSE THEY
 DIDN'T TAKE OFFICE UNTIL THE
 NEXT JANUARY, HE GETS CREDIT
 FOR THOSE JOBS, WHO GETS CREDIT
 IS UP FOR DEBATE.
 THE NEXT CLAIM IS ABOUT THE
 BORDER.
 IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, OUR
 BRAVE VICE OFFICERS MADE
 266,000 ARRESTS OF CRIMINAL
 ALIENS, INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED
 OR CONVICTED OF NEARLY 100,000
 ASSAULTS, 30,000 SEX CRIMES,
 AND 4000 KILLINGS.
 DATA KEPT BY ICE BACKS THESE
 NUMBERS UP SO WE CAN VERIFY
 THIS IS TRUE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS
 IMPORTANT CONTEXT, ABOUT HALF
 OF THEM WERE FOR ASSAULT AND
 SEX CRIMES AND MURDERING THE
 OTHER HALF FOR NONVIOLENT
 CRIMES INCLUDING ILLEGAL ENTRY
 AND THE NEXT IS ABOUT NORTH
 KOREA.
 OUR HOSTAGES HAVE COME HOME.
 NUCLEAR TESTING HAS STOPPED.
 AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A
 MISSILE LAUNCH IN MORE THAN 15
 MONTHS.
 A LITTLE BACK STORY, THREE
 AMERICANS WERE DETAINED AND
 RETURNED IN MAY 2018.
 TO ANSWER THE NUCLEAR QUESTION,
 WE TURN TO NORTH KOREAN EXPERT
 THAT SAYS EVEN THOUGH THE
 COUNTRY COULD DO SCIENTIFIC
 RESEARCH AND COMPUTER
 SIMULATION ON WEAPONS OF MASS
 DESTRUCTION, THEY STOPPED
 FIRING MISSILES OVER THE KOREAN
 PENINSULA.
 WE CAN VERIFY THAT THIS IS TRUE
 AND AS YOU MENTIONED BEFORE, WE
 HAVE A LIVE BLOG RUNNING TO
 FACT CHECK TRUMP AND STACEY
 ABRAMS AND THEY CHECKED ON WAY
 MORE.
 I KNOW YOU HAVE THE FINAL
 THOUGHT COMING UP ON THE STATE
 OF THE UNION COMING UP LATER AS
 WELL.
 MAKE A BUNCH OF NOTABLE
 OMISSIONS, BUT IT IS A CRAZY
 STATE OF AFFAIRS WHERE WE NEED
 THIS LEVEL OF FACT CHECKING.
 ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GO
 LONG, THIS WAS THE THIRD
 LONGEST EVER, THE LONGEST SINCE
 CLINTON.
 82 MINUTES, THAT'S A LOT TO
 CRAM IN.
 IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU
 WANT VERIFIED, LET OUR
 RESEARCHERS GET TO THE BOTTOM
 OF IT.
 SEND US THE EMAIL AT VERIFY AT
 WUSA9.COM.
 MOST OF YOU THINK THE SPEECH
 NEVER HAD A CHANCE AND THANK
 YOU FOR VOTING  NEVER HAD A
 CHANCE, YOU COULD HAVE EASILY
 VOTED NO, BUT NEVER HAD A
 CHANCE ACKNOWLEDGES YOU CAME IN
 WITH PRE-EXISTING FEELINGS.
 KEEP VOTING ALL MORNING LONG.
 THAT'S CHECK THE MOMENTS THAT
 CAUGHT SOCIAL MEDIA ATTENTION.
 LOTS OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT
 IT.
 THERE WAS A STRIKING VISUAL IN
 ANY PARTS OF THE CROWD DURING
 THE STATE OF THE UNION.
 DOZENS OF DEMOCRATIC WOMEN OF
 CONGRESS DRESSED IN ALL WHITE
 AS A TRIBUTE TO SUFFRAGETTES.
 MANY OF THEM ARE FIRST-TIME
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND
 CURRENTLY A RECORD-BREAKING 102
 WOMEN SERVING IN THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES.
 THIS YEAR MARKS 100 YEARS SINCE
 CONGRESS PASSED AN AMENDMENT
 GIVING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE
 AND ONE MOMENT THAT SURPRISED
 PEOPLE LAST NIGHT, IT WAS THIS,
 RIGHT HERE ASTRONAUT BUZZ
 ALDRIN MADE A SURPRISE
 APPEARANCE.
 THE 89-YEAR-OLD IS ONE OF THE
 FIRST TWO PEOPLE TO STEP ON THE
 MOON.
 HE USED HIS APPEARANCE TO
 PROMISE TO RETURN AMERICAN
 ASTRONAUTS TO THE BASE.
 [ MUSIC ] â™ª HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO
 YOU.
 CANNOT BACK
 BOTH PARTIES UNIFY TO SING
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO AN AMAZING
 MAN.
 HE IS A SURVIVOR OF THE
 HOLOCAUST AND WAS INSIDE THE
 TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE IN
 PITTSBURGH DURING A MASS
 SHOOTING LAST YEAR.
 THEY THANKED EVERYONE IN THE
 CROWD FOR THE SONG, AND
 BREAKING NEWS FROM OVERNIGHT,
 FIRE FORCES FOR PEOPLE OUT OF
 THEIR HOME IN SOUTHEAST DC.
 FIREFIGHTERS WERE CALLED TO A
 ROW HOME ON E STREET AROUND
 11:00 LAST NIGHT.
 TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, YOU CAN
 SEE HOW INTENSE THE BIG FLAMES
 WERE.
 WHEN CREWS ARRIVED, FLAMES SHOT
 OUT OF A SECOND STORY WINDOW.
 WE ARE TOLD THE FIRE WAS
 ISOLATED TO JUST ONE ROOM AND
 CREWS QUICKLY GOT THINGS UNDER
 CONTROL.
 INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE IS
 UNDERWAY.
 WE ARE TOLD THAT THE POOR
 PEOPLE DISPLACED WERE ABLE TO
 FIND OTHER PLACES TO STAY.
 AND HAVE YOU EVER SENT A
 MESSAGE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY
 REGRETTED IT.
 IT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US AT SOME
 POINT.
 FACEBOOK IS ROLLING OUT AN
 UNSEND MESSAGE FEATURE TO ITS
 MESSENGER APP FOR IOS AND
 ANDROID TO DELETE A MESSAGE
 FROM A SINGLE OR GROUP CHAT.
 YOU JUST HAVE TO TAP ON THE
 MESSAGE YOU WANT TO REMOVE AND
 PRESS DELETE AND CHOOSE THE
 OPTION LABELED DELETE FOR
 EVERYONE.
 IT GIVES YOU 10 MINUTES TO
 RETHINK WHAT YOU JUST SENT.
 BUT UNSEND DOESN'T MEAN UNSEEN,
 IF YOUR FRIEND IS AT WORK
 LOGGING INTO FACEBOOK AND YOU
 SEND THEM A PICTURE OR MESSAGE,
 IT ALREADY POPS UP IN THE
 WINDOW, SO IT IS SEEN, SO YOU
 CANNOT THEN DELETE IT.
 THAT IS MESSED UP ESPECIALLY
 VF NOTIFICATIONS ON, SO IT'S AT
 THE NOTIFICATION EMAIL EVEN IF
 YOU UNSEND IT.
 THIS IS INSPIRING TO ALL OF THE
 GUYS OUT THERE THAT WERE
 FEELING SHY ABOUT JUMPING INTO
 DM'S BECAUSE THEY COULD GET
 SCREEN SHOT IT, THAT IS A
 HORRIBLE REALITY FOR ME, BUT
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
 THAT ANYMORE.
 ALL OF THESE YOUNG PLAYERS LIKE
 JAKE AND GEO, EVERYONE WANTS TO
 HOP INTO DM'S, PLAY ON.
 ADD TO THE DM'S.
 MY APOLOGY EVERYONE OUT
 THERE, YOU ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A
 LOT OF MAIL WHEN YOU GET BACK.
 WHAT IS ONE THING WE NEED TO
 KNOW ABOUT THE FORECAST.
 THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO
 KNOW IS THAT IT IS COOLER TODAY
 WITH A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS.
 WE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS ON I-95
 IN MARYLAND HEADING SOUTHBOUND
 PASSING BY ROUTE 212, A LIVE
 TRAFFIC LANE CAMERA, A TRACTOR-
 TRAILER CAUGHT ON CAMERA, THAT
 IS OVER ON THE SHOULDER.
 IT IS 6:10, IT IS TIME FOR
 ANOTHER NEWS WE LOOK AT THE NEW
 STORIES THAT MAY NOT BE ON YOUR
 RADAR, BUT THEY SHOULD BE.
 A BILL IN HAWAII PROPOSES
 RAISING THE LEGAL SMOKING AGE
 TO 100 YEARS OLD.
 IT SUGGESTS THAT SMOKING AGE
 SHOULD GO UP TO 30 IN 2020 AND
 40 AND 2021, 50 IN 2022 AND 60
 IN 2023 AND FINALLY IN, AS THE
 70-YEAR-OLDS THINK THE TIME IS
 COME, PEOPLE NEED TO BE 100
 YEARS OLD TO BUY CIGARETTES.
 FAKE ID PRODUCTION IN HAWAII IS
 ABOUT TO GET REAL CRAZY.
 AND OTHER NEWS, HOWARD
 SCHULTZ TOOK PERSONAL OFFENSE
 TO BEING DESCRIBED AS A
 BILLIONAIRE IN A RECENT
 INTERVIEW.
 HE SAID PEOPLE SHOULD USE
 PEOPLE OF WEALTH OR PEOPLE OF
 MEANS TO DESCRIBE HIS CLASS.
 HIS CLASS ACCOUNTS FOR 1% OF
 THE WORLD'S POPULATION.
 IN RESPONSE, THE OTHER 99% OF
 US KNOWN AS THE PEOPLE WITH NO
 WEALTH WOULD ALSO LIKE A NEW
 DESCRIPTION INSTEAD OF BROKE,
 WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDRESSED
 AS BILLIONAIRES.
 A JOGGER IN COLORADO
 SUFFOCATED AN 80 POUND MOUNTAIN
 LION WITH HIS BARE HANDS AFTER
 HE WAS ATTACKED ON THE TRAIL.
 THE MAN WAS RUNNING AND HEARD
 SOMETHING BEHIND HIM AND WHEN
 HE TURNED AROUND, HE SAW A
 MOUNTAIN LION.
 I'M HERE TO MAKE A CONFESSION.
 I WAS THAT JOGGER.
 THESE ARE THE HANDS OF A MAN
 THAT CAN OPEN A PICKLE JAR AND
 PROTECT HIMSELF FROM THEM
 OUTLINE OR ANY BIG CAT.
 I DON'T KNOW MY OWN STRENGTH.
 AND IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO COME
 FORWARD, I WILL TAKE ALL OF THE
 GLORY, IF YOU CAN TAKE THEM
 OUTLINE, LET US KNOW WHAT THE
 HASHTAG, GET UP DC.
 IT IS 6:12, 46 DEGREES AND
 COMING UP, REST IN RESIDENCE,
 IF YOU THOUGHT YOU HEARD TRAINS
 THIS MORNING, YOU WERE NOT
 HALLUCINATING.
 WE GIVE YOU THE DETAILS IN JUST
 A MOMENT.
 IT'S BEEN FIVE DAYS SINCE A
 PHOTO POPPED UP OF THE YEARBOOK
 FROM RALPH NORTHAM, CLASSMATES
 SAID THAT WAS NOT HIM.
 ENDED HIS NATIONAL GIRLS
 AND WOMEN IN SPORTS DAY, WE
 HAVE ONE OF THE MOST FIT
 AUDIENCES YOU HAVE EVER SEEN
 THIS ONE WE ARE JOINED BY
 MEMBERS OF THE SWIM TEAM FOR
 CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY AND THE
 DIVE TEAM.
 NEXT, WE'LL MEET ONE SWIMMER
 WHO IS NOT ONLY SETTING RECORDS
 IN THE POOL BUT ALSO BREAKING
 GROUND ON
     JARDIANCE asked:
    When it comes to managing    your type 2 diabetes,
       what matters to you?
            Let's see.    Most of you say lower A1C.
      But only a few of you
  are thinking about your heart.
     Fact is, even though     it helps to manage A1C,
      type 2 diabetes still      increases your risk
        of a fatal heart        attack or stroke.
      JARDIANCE is the first      type 2 diabetes pill
        with a lifesaving      cardiovascular benefit
   for adults who have type 2   diabetes and heart disease,
    JARDIANCE significantly    reduces the risk of dying
   from a cardiovascular event
         and lowers A1C,     with diet and exercise.
    Let's give it another try.
      <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i>      <i> serious side effects</i>
     <i> including dehydration.</i>
      <i> This may cause you</i>      <i> to feel dizzy, faint,</i>
         <i> or lightheaded,</i>     <i> or weak upon standing.</i>
          <i> Ketoacidosis</i>    <i> is a serious side effect</i>
       <i> that may be fatal.</i>
    <i> Symptoms include nausea,</i>    <i> vomiting, stomach pain,</i>
           <i> tiredness,</i>     <i> and trouble breathing.</i>
   <i> A rare but life-threatening</i>       <i> bacterial infection</i>
   <i> in the skin of the genital</i>   <i> area could also occur.</i>
      <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> and call your doctor right away</i>
      <i> if you have symptoms</i>  <i> of this bacterial infection,</i>
          <i> ketoacidosis</i>    <i> or an allergic reaction.</i>
     <i> Symptoms of an allergic</i>     <i> reaction include rash,</i>
    <i> swelling, and difficulty</i>    <i> breathing or swallowing.</i>
     <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i>     <i> if you are on dialysis</i>
 <i> or have severe kidney problems.</i>
     <i> Other side effects are</i>     <i> sudden kidney problems,</i>
   <i> genital yeast infections,</i>   <i> increased bad cholesterol,</i>
  <i> and urinary tract infections,</i>      <i> which may be serious.</i>
    <i> Taking JARDIANCE with</i>    <i> a sulfonylurea or insulin</i>
   <i> may cause low blood sugar.</i>
   <i> Tell your doctor about</i>   <i> all the medicines you take</i>
       <i> and if you have any</i>       <i> medical conditions.</i>
  Isn't it time to rethink your  type 2 diabetes medication?
 Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE
       and get to the heart       of what matters.
 TODAY IS NATIONAL GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SPORTS DAY, SO WE
 INVITED THE SWIMMING TEAM FROM
 CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY TO JOIN US
 AND WE ASKED THEM TO NOMINATE
 ONE TEAMMATE WHO REALLY
 INSPIRED THEM.
 Reporter: SWIMMING IS ALL
 ABOUT REST.
 AND EMILY MUSSINA GETS A LOT OF
 IT.
 THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY STUDENT
 SPENDS A LOT OF TIME INSIDE
 THIS POOL AND SHE WILL ADMIT,
 SPORTS ARE KIND OF HER LIFE.
 I LIKE SPORTS, THAT'S HIGH
 UP ON MY LIST.
 Reporter: AND SHE IS REALLY
 GOOD, ONE OF THE BEST ON THE
 TEAM, EARNING HER A SPOT ON THE
 HANGING BANNER FOR THE FASTEST
 200 YARD PLY IN SCHOOL HISTORY.
 IT'S NOT JUST SWIMMING, SHE WAS
 DOING PLAY-BY-PLAY FOR THE
 BASEBALL TEAM, A DREAM OF HERS
 SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL,
 SHE CAN REMEMBER THE EXACT
 MOMENT WHEN THE DREAM WAS BORN.
 10 YEARS OLD RIDING IN THE
 BACKSEAT OF OUR CAR ON A TWO-
 HOUR DRIVE TO THE BEACH AND MY
 PARENTS ARE YOU, MY PARENTS ARE
 LISTENING TO THE YANKEES GAME.
 SHE HEARD THE BOYS.
 IT WAS AN AHA MOMENT FOR ME.
 I WAS YOUNG, HEARING SOMEONE
 ELSE DOING THAT AND KNOWING,
 OKAY, THIS COULD BE A REALITY
 FOR ME.
 SINCE THEN, SHE HAS HAD THE
 PEDAL TO THE METAL SWIMMING SIX
 DAYS A WEEK AND FINDING TIME TO
 WORK FOR THE ATHLETIC
 DEPARTMENT.
 WHEN SHE GRADUATES, SHE WILL
 START WORKING FOR THE LYNCHBURG
 HILL CAPS IN CENTRAL VIRGINIA
 AND SHE KNOWS THAT BASEBALL IS
 STILL A MALE DOMINATED
 INDUSTRY, BUT THAT WILL NOT
 STOP HER.
 WOMEN CAN DO ANYTHING THEY
 WANT, THEY CAN COMPETE ON THE
 SAME LEVEL AS MEN, AND THEY
 SHOULD AND THEY SHOULD KNOW
 THAT THEY ARE WORTH IT AND THEY
 SHOULD KNOW THEIR VALUE.
 WHY NOT US?
 I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO
 EMILY AND THE REST OF HER TEAM
 FOR SHOWING UP SO EARLY IN THE
 MORNING, YOU ARE IN COLLEGE AND
 YOU ARE PROBABLY UP FROM LAST
 NIGHT.
 AND A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO THE
 DIVE TEAM, I FORGOT ABOUT THE
 THREE OF YOU ON THE DIVE TEAM,
 OR IS IT ONLY ONE OF YOU NOW?
 YOU ARE DIVING FOR
 EVERYBODY.
 THANK YOU FOR THAT, WE CAUGHT
 UP WITH HER COACH TO TALK ABOUT
 HER AND YOU CAN FIND THE
 INTERVIEW ON OUR WEBSITE,
 WUSA9.COM.
 DO YOUR THING.
 I APPRECIATE THE WARM
 INTRODUCTION, HERE ARE THREE
 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
 THE FORECAST, WE'VE GOT SHOWERS
 TODAY AFTER 2:00 AND MORE RAIN
 ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND
 COLDER THIS WEEKEND, NEXT WEEK
 TRENT, WINTER IS ON ITS WAY
 BACK WITH RAIN AND SNOW CHANCES
 IN THE FORECAST, ESPECIALLY
 MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND
 WEDNESDAY.
 HE IS WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT
 NOW, WE HAVE A FRONT THAT IS
 LINGERING ACROSS THE AREA.
 AS LONG AS IT LINGERS, WE HAVE
 CLOUDS OUT THERE AND SHOWERS
 AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN
 REASONS WE SEE RAIN TODAY.
 HIGH TEMPERATURES 40 TO 55
 DEGREES, A SHARP DIFFERENCE
 FROM YESTERDAY WHERE WE TOPPED
 OUT AT 74 DEGREES FOR RECORD
 WARM TEMPERATURES.
 WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES.
 46 BY 10 AM AND 47 BY NOON AND
 RIGHT AROUND 48 BY 2:00 THIS
 AFTERNOON.
 FUTURECAST, YOU NOTICED THE
 TEMPERATURES GETTING INTO THE
 50s BY THE AFTERNOON AND BY
 2:30, THERE IS RAIN OVER
 OAKLAND AND CUMBERLAND AND EVEN
 TOWARDS MARTINSBURG AND
 WINCHESTER.
 I 6:00, LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN
 MAKES ITS WAY INTO METRO DC AND
 THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS SOME
 OF THE TIMING OF WHY POPPER
 MADE THE CALL TO GIVE IT A
 YELLOW WEATHER EARLIER TODAY.
 8:00 TONIGHT, THERE STILL SOME
 RAIN OUT THERE, BREAK LATE
 TONIGHT AND THEN TOMORROW
 MORNING WE LOOK AT SOME SHOWERS
 AND ONCE AGAIN WITH A BREAK IN
 THE AFTERNOON AND WARMER
 TEMPERATURES REARING UP ONCE
 AGAIN.
 A STRONG COLD FRONT IS HEADING
 AWAY ON FRIDAY.
 LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURES AHEAD
 OF THE FRONT, 60s AHEAD OF THE
 FRONT ON FRIDAY AND THE COLD
 AIR COMES SOARING IN AND WE
 FIND TEMPERATURES GETTING DOWN
 TO THE 30s AND 40s OVER THE
 WEEKEND.
 WE'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS ON
 SOCIAL MEDIA, JACKSON AND
 ROBBIE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SNOW
 HEADING OUR WAY NEXT WEEK.
 HERE IT IS, WINTER IS COMING
 BACK WITH A RAIN AND SNOW MIXED
 POSSIBLE MONDAY MORNING AT THE
 LATEST TREND IN THE MODELS HAVE
 BEEN TO KEEP THE RAIN AROUND DC
 AND KEEP THE RAIN AND SNOW LIED
 FURTHER UP TO THE NORTH.
 THERE IS STILL TIME TO SORT
 THIS OUT, BUT ON TUESDAY, WE
 HAVE A CHANCE TO GET A WINTRY
 MIX AROUND HERE WITH RAIN AND
 SNOW AT PLAY BY LATE TUESDAY
 MORNING.
 WE ARE WATCHING ALL OF THIS FOR
 YOU IN TERMS OF WINTER COMING
 BACK.
 50s TODAY, 64 ON FRIDAY WITH
 FALLING TEMPERATURES AND 39 ON
 SATURDAY AND 41 BY SUNDAY.
 WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY SERIOUS
 CRASHES OUT THERE THIS MORNING,
 ONE ON THE I-95, A TRACTOR-
 TRAILER CAUGHT ON FIRE AS HE
 TRIED HAD SOUTHBOUND IN
 MARYLAND PASSING BY REP TO 12.
 THE FIRE IS OUT AND TRAFFIC IS
 NOT REALLY JAMMED AS YOU TRY TO
 PASS BY THIS BECAUSE THE TRUCK
 IS OVER ON THE SHOULDER NOW.
 WE HAVE AN ACCIDENT WITHOUT
 MANY BACKUPS ON ROUTE 28
 SOUTHBOUND PAST ROUTE 7. FOR
 VEHICLES INVOLVED IN THE CRASH
 IN SOUTH BEND BY EAST CAPITOL
 STREET, THAT'S BEEN PUSHED OVER
 TO THE LEFT SHOULDER AND ON
 ROUTE 5, A SERIOUS CRASH IN ST.
 MARY'S HEADING SOUTH BEND BY
 THREE NOTCH ROAD, ALL OF THE
 SOUTHBOUND LANES ARE SLOW.
 SO THIS IS A PICTURE FROM THE
 SCENE FROM MECHANICSVILLE
 VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT.
 YOU CAN SEE THE COMMUTER BUS
 AND NO ONE WAS ON IT, BUT IT
 WAS INVOLVED WITH A UTILITY
 TRUCK, SOMEONE WAS MEDEVAC.
 AND WE ARE SEEING DELAYS ON
 ROUTE 5.
 A NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS, WE
 CERTAINLY HOPE EVERYONE EMERGES

 WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY TO GET UP DC, IT IS 6:24, HERE ARE
 THE THREE THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE
 HEADING OUT THIS MORNING,
 PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT NATURAL
 GAS LEAKS IN DC CAN SHARE
 EXPERIENCES WITH THE PUBLIC
 SERVICE COMMISSION.
 THE PSC IS HOLDING THE REGULAR
 MEETING AT 2:00 AND AFTER THE
 MEETING, COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE
 INVITED TO ASK WASHINGTON GAS
 OFFICIALS ABOUT SAFETY AND
 PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES AND
 MANY MORE THINGS.
 PEOPLE FROM RESTON TO JUST
 SOUTH OR WEST OF DULLES AIRPORT
 MAY HAVE HEARD METRO TRAINS
 RUNNING THIS MORNING ON PHASE 2
 OF THE SILVER LINE.
 EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT OPEN YET,
 METRO SAYS THE TRAINS RAN
 BETWEEN 1:00 BEFORE A.M.
 TO HELP REMOVE THE RUST FROM
 THE THIRD RAIL.
 IT CAN BUILD UP SINCE THE LINE
 IS NOT IN USE.
 THE REAL WORK IS NEEDED SO
 METRO CAN START BREAKING TESTS
 ON PHASE 2 WHICH IS SET TO OPEN
 NEXT YEAR.
 AND TODAY IN PRINCE GEORGE'S
 COUNTY, THE DEPARTMENT OF
 PUBLIC WORKS CREWS CAN START
 REPAIRING PESKY POTHOLES THAT
 OPENED UP SINCE THE RECENT
 SNOWSTORM AND THE COLD SNAP.
 YOU CAN REPORT POTHOLES BY
 CALLING 31 A. DRIVERS ARE ASKED
 TO SLOW DOWN AND GIVE CREWS 20
 OF WORK SPACE.
 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT MY
 CAR IS GETTING PUMMELED BY
 THESE POTHOLES.
 I HAVE TO GET ALIGNMENT AND
 SUSPENSION WORK.
 THEY NEED TO REPLACE THE
 ENTIRE MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE.
 JUST THROW THE WHOLE THING AWAY
 AND START OVER.
 WE NEED A NEW ONE.
 IT IS TIME FOR GET AT
 REESE, WE FEATURE A COMMENT
 THAT GETS IN EVERY DAY.
 TODAY COMES ON MY FINAL
 THOUGHTS ABOUT RALPH NORTHAM
 AFTER A MEDICINE, A MEDICAL
 SCHOOL YEARBOOK WAS REVEALED.
 THE BACKLASH SEEMED SPORADIC.
 TED DANSON WORE BLACK FACE IN
 PUBLIC WHILE DATING WHOOPI
 GOLDBERG, SHOULDN'T AVERAGE BE
 HELD EQUALLY?
 I AGREE THIS IS BEEN
 UNACCEPTABLE AND INSINCERE,
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT, BUT
 WHAT DOES TED DANSON HAVE TO DO
 WITH THIS?
 HE IS NOT THE GOVERNOR OF A
 STATE, AND HE WAS IN A
 POSITION, WHERE HE HAD TO TREAT
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN TREATMENTS,
 AND HE DID TAKE HEAT, IT WAS
 BAD THEN AND IT IS BAD NOW.
 IT HAS AND NEVER WILL BE
 ACCEPTABLE BUT LET'S NOT PLAY A
 BLAME GAME ESPECIALLY WITH TED
 DANSON, BLACKFACE IS AND ALWAYS
 WILL BE WRONG WHETHER TO 1943
 OR 1993 OR 2023.
 KEEP SENDING COMMENTS TO ME AT
 REESE WATERS ON FACEBOOK AND
 TWITTER OR EMAIL R WATERS AT
 WUSA9.COM.
 YOU CAN ALWAYS USE THE HASHTAG
 GET UP DC.
 IT IS 6:27, 46 DEGREES IN COMING UP, THE DEMOCRATIC
 RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE
 UNION CALLED FOR TEAMWORK WITH     <i> When was the last time</i>          <i> you felt...</i>
              <i> Free.</i>
      <i> It's time to uncover</i>      <i> that feeling again.</i>
     <i> With the compassion and</i>      <i> strength of a name...</i>
  <i> Most accepted by top doctors</i>        <i> and specialists.</i>
   <i> And the power of a card...</i>

         <i> We want them to</i>        <i> grow up stronger.</i>
 NINE FORMER CLASSMATES HAVE COME FORWARD TO DEFEND GOVERNOR
 RALPH NORTHAM SAYING HE WAS NOT
 IN THE PHOTO IN THE YEARBOOK
 THAT CAME FORWARD JUST YEARS
 AGO, JUST DAYS AGO.
 THE STATE OF THE UNION

 INCLUDING NORTH KOREA.
 WE HAVE MORE COMING UP.
 MUCH COOLER TODAY AFTER THE
 TASTE OF SPRING AND SUMMER
 YESTERDAY.
 DC IS A CITY OF BANDWAGON
 FANS?
 WE FIND OUT IN OUR MOST DC
 THING.
 GET UP DC.

 GET UP DC, IT IS 46 DEGREES
 OUTSIDE.
 I AM YOUR HOST, REESE WATERS.
 VIRGINIA GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM
 STILL HAS HIS JOB TODAY DESPITE
 RACIST PHOTOS FROM HIS MEDICAL
 SCHOOL YEARBOOK.
 ARE YOU ALL SURPRISED HE IS IN
 OFFICE?
 TWEET US AND LET US KNOW AND
 USE THE HASHTAG GET UP DC.
 I REALLY WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU
 GUYS THINK.
 I WILL HAVE THE LATEST ON WHAT
 YOU THINK IF HE DID STEP DOWN,
 WILL IT RAIN ON MORE THAN
 VIRGINIA TODAY?
 WE HAVE RAIN CHANCES
 AREAWIDE, WE DON'T SEE MUCH OF
 THAT RIGHT NOW.
 CLOUDY AND 47 AS YOU STEP
 OUTSIDE AND BIG CHANGES BETWEEN
 TODAY AND YESTERDAY.
 SHOWERS WILL PUSH IN AT 230 IN
 THE AFTERNOON AND WE COULD SEE
 THEM AROUND ROMNEY AND
 CUMBERLAND AND IN METRO DC, WE
 HAVE THE RAIN FALLING WHICH IS
 ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE
 ISSUED THE YELLOW WEATHER
 ALERT.
 LIGHT RAIN PUSHING IN DURING
 THE EVENING RUSH AND DINNER
 HOURS HAS RAIN.
 IN TERMS OF HIGH TEMPERATURES,
 TODAY IS COOLER THAN YESTERDAY
 WITH A RECORD HIGH OF 74 AND
 TODAY IS 48 TO 55 DEGREES WITH
 SHOWERS AND QUITE CLOUDY.
 SPEAKING OF RECORD TEMPERATURES,
 BY JANUARY 31, WE HAD A LOW OF
 10 DEGREES.
 GUESS TODAY WAS 74 AND A 64
 DEGREE DIFFERENCE IN A MATTER
 OF DAYS.
 I WILL TAKE THE ONE ON THE
 RIGHT.
 WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS,
 ROUTE 5 IS STILL CLOSED HEADING
 SOUTHBOUND IN ST. MARY'S BY
 THREE NOTCH ROAD AND SOUTHBOUND
 LANES ARE CLOSED.
 WE'VE HAD A MEDEVAC SITUATION,
 PRETTY SERIOUS CRASH WITH THE
 COMMUTER BUS INVOLVED.
 IN FREDERICK, NORTH AND
 SOUTHBOUND LANES HAVE BEEN
 CLOSED AND WE'VE HAD AN
 ACCIDENT BY MOUNDSVILLE ROAD
 AND IF YOU ARE IN NORTHEAST,
 NEW YORK AVENUE INBOUND HAS
 REPORTS OF A CRASH IF YOU TRIED
 TO PASS BY BLADEN'S BILL ROAD.
 IT HAS BEEN FIVE DAYS SINCE
 WE LEARNED ABOUT THE RACIST
 PHOTOS POSSIBLY CONNECTED TO
 VIRGINIA GOVERNOR RALPH
 NORTHAM.
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE THE
 WILD PRESS CONFERENCE OVER THE
 WEEKEND, BUT HE IS STILL
 GETTING WORK DONE.
 WHERE IS HE GETTING SUPPORT
 FROM NOW?
 BASICALLY NINE FORMER
 CLASSMATES OF HIS HAVE COME
 FORWARD TO DEFEND THE GOVERNOR.
 THEY WERE ALL CLASSMATES AT THE
 EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL
 FACILITY., MEDICAL SCHOOL.
 LET'S START RIGHT THERE AND
 LOOK AT WHAT THEY WROTE.
 HERE IS THE STATEMENT, WE
 FULLY BELIEVE GOVERNOR RALPH
 NORTHAM IS NEITHER OF THE
 INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE REPUGNANT
 COSTUMES.
 WE ATTENDED CLASSES WITH THE
 GOVERNOR AND SOCIALIZED WITH
 HIM AND WE KNEW HIM VERY WELL,
 BUT THINGS REMAIN PRETTY ROCKY
 FOR THE EMBATTLED GOVERNOR. HE
 HAS BEEN HELD UP IN THE
 EXECUTIVE MANSION AND HIS
 CALENDAR NOT UPDATED FOR DAYS,
 MANY PUBLIC EVENTS HAVE BEEN
 CANCELED, BUT BEHIND CLOSED
 DOORS COME HE'S TRYING TO
 GOVERN.
 HE SIGNED OFF ON THE
 LEGISLATION TO GIVE AMAZON
 MILLIONS IN INCENTIVES AND
 YESTERDAY, HE SENT OUT A
 STATEMENT SENDING CONDOLENCES
 TO THE FAMILY OF A STATE
 TROOPER KILLED IN THE LINE OF
 DUTY.
 THE NEW YORK TIMES IS REPORTING
 THAT HE PLANS TO HIRE A PRIVATE
 INVESTIGATOR TO LOOK INTO THE
 PICTURE AND FIND OUT HOW IT GOT
 IN THE YEARBOOK.
 MANY LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH
 PARTIES, EVEN MANY WHO ARE
 TRADITIONAL ALLIES ARE CALLING
 FOR HIS RESIGNATION.
 I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY HE
 DIDN'T RESIGN, BUT
 WE CALL FOR THE RESIGNATION,
 THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR DOES.
 ADDING TO THE CRISIS, SEXUAL
 ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS DATING BACK
 TO 2004 AGAINST JUSTIN FAIRFAX,
 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO
 WOULD TAKE OVER IN A NORTHAM
 RESIGNATION OFFERED A STRONG
 DENIAL.
 THE ALLEGATION THE VAPORIZER
 YEAR AND ONLY RESURFACED ON THE
 EVE OF THE ELEVATION GIVEN THE
 CURRENT SITUATION, SO IT IS ALL
 COMPLETELY POLITICAL AND A
 COMPLETE SMEAR.
 WE ARE LEARNING THAT THE
 ACCUSER OF JUSTIN FAIRFAX HAS
 HIRED A LAWYER, AND
 INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IT'S THE
 SAME LEGAL TEAM THAT
 REPRESENTED CHRISTINE BLASEY
 FORD DURING THE NOMINATION OF
 RHETT CAVANAUGH.
 AS FOR WHETHER HE WILL RESIGN,
 AT THIS POINT, THAT IS STILL
 ANYONE GAS.
 AS WE WERE DISCUSSING, IT
 WAS INTERESTING WORDING THAT WE
 DON'T BELIEVE IT IS HIM HIM AND
 NOT THAT WE KNOW THAT IT WASN'T
 HIM.
 NOT THAT WE HAVE ANY NEW
 INFORMATION, WE JUST FEEL LIKE
 HE'S NOT THE KIND OF PERSON
 THAT WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE
 THAT.
 INDICATING THAT THEY DON'T
 ACTUALLY KNOW, BUT THEY DON'T
 THINK HE WOULD BE CAPABLE OF
 DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
 WE ALL THOUGHT THAT, THAT'S
 HOW HE GOT ELECTED.
 SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
 IF HE RESIGNS AND JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX TAKES OVER, IF FAIRFAX
 STEPS DOWN, WHO TAKES OVER FOR
 HIM?
 HERE IS SOME CLARITY ABOUT WHAT
 THE VIRGINIA LAW SAYS ABOUT WHO
 STEPS UP WHEN LEADERS STEP
 DOWN.
 LET'S ABLE TO GOVERNOR AND
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR STEP DOWN,
 WHO TAKES OVER?
 WE WENT TO THE VIRGINIA
 CONSTITUTION FOR THE ANSWER,
 AND ACCORDING TO THE
 CONSTITUTION, THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL WOULD BECOME THE ACTING
 GOVERNOR.
 THAT MAN IS MARK HERRING.
 HE IS AN ELIGIBLE HOUSE OF, THE
 SPEAKER WOULD TAKE OVER.
 BOTH MEN HAVE CALLED FOR THE
 RESIGNATION.
 6:36 ON THIS WEDNESDAY
 MORNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 DELIVERED HIS SECOND STATE OF
 THE UNION ADDRESS BEFORE
 CONGRESS ON TUESDAY LAST NIGHT.
 HE URGED LAWMAKERS TO BREAK
 WHAT HE CALLED DECADES OF
 POLITICAL STALEMATES.
 I AM ASKING YOU TO CHOOSE
 GREATNESS, NO MATTER THE TRIALS
 WE FACE, NO MATTER THE
 CHALLENGES TO COME, WE MUST GO
 FORWARD TOGETHER, WE MUST KEEP
 AMERICA FIRST IN OUR HEARTS.
'S WORDS FOLLOW THE 35 DAY
 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND WITH
 THE THREAT OF ANOTHER ONE
 LOOMING, THE PRISON ALSO
 ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A TWO-DAY
 SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER
 KIM JONG-UN IN VIETNAM LATER
 THIS MONTH AND HE MADE AN
 APPARENT REFERENCE TO THE
 RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION CITING
 RIDICULOUS PARTISAN
 INVESTIGATION.
 EVEN AS I AM DISAPPOINTED BY
 THE APPROACH TO OUR PROBLEM, I
 STILL DON'T WANT HIM TO FAIL.
 BUT WE NEED HIM TO TELL THE
 TRUTH.
 AND TO RESPECT HIS DUTIES.
 AND RESPECT THE EXTRAORDINARY
 DIVERSITY THAT DEFINES AMERICA.
 THE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE AS
 YOU HEARD WAS FROM STACIE
 ABRAMS WHO LOST THE GEORGIA
 GOVERNOR'S RACE LAST YEAR.
 SHE IS THE FIRST AFRICAN-
 AMERICAN WOMAN TO HANDLE THE
 STATE OF THE UNION RESPONSE.
 SHE SAID IT WAS A STUNT
 ENGINEERED BY THE PRESIDENT.
 AND
 SAINT ALBANS SCHOOL IS
 LOOKING INTO SEXUAL ASSAULT
 ALLEGATIONS.
 IT HAS NO EVIDENCE OF RECENT
 ALLEGATIONS, BUT THERE HAVE
 BEEN ACCOUNTS OF WRONGDOING BY
 FORMER TEACHERS.
 THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED
 THAT A MAN TAUGHT IN SAINT
 ALBANS IN THE 80s AFTER BEING
 FIRED FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL OVER
 SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS.
 AND THIS IS SUCH BAD NEWS, MORE
 BAD NEWS FOR WIZARDS FANS.
 WE ALREADY KNEW JOHN WALL WOULD
 MISS A SEASON AFTER GETTING
 SURGERY ON HIS HEEL, BUT NEXT
 SEASON IS IN JEOPARDY AS WELL.
 HE WILL MISS MOST IF NOT ALL OF
 NEXT SEASON BECAUSE HE NEEDS
 SURGERY ON HIS LEFT ACHILLES
 TENDON WHICH HE TORE AFTER A
 FALL IN HIS HOME.
 DOCTORS DISCOVERED THE INJURY
 ON MONDAY.
 HE IS SET TO MAKE ALMOST $40
 MILLION NEXT SEASON.
 THAT IS GOOD WORK IF YOU CAN
 GET IT.
 THAT MUST'VE BEEN A BAD
 FALL, BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE
 TO FALL HARD FOR IT TO BE AND
 THAT BAD SHAPE.
 ANY VIEWERS THAT MAKE IT
 THROUGH THIS WIZARD SEASON, I
 THINK DESERVES A NANCY PELOSI
 CLAP.
 ON THE SAINT ALBANS STORY,
 THAT IS MY ALMA MATER AND I'M A
 LOVER OF THAT SCHOOL AND I JUST
 WANT COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY.
 I HOPE THEY DO THE
 INVESTIGATION AND THEY GET TO
 THE BOTTOM OF IT SO THEY CAN
 EITHER CLEAR THE SCHOOL NAME OR
 EXACTLY BE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO
 HANDLE SCANDALS LIKE THIS WHEN
 THEY OCCUR.
 FAR FROM BEING OVER.
 WE CONTINUE THE WEEKLONG
 SERIES ON THE AMAZON EFFECT
 ALONG WITH THE PROMISE OF HIGH-
 PAYING JOBS, WE GET MORE
 EXPENSIVE HOUSING AND POSSIBLY
 MORE PEOPLE PRICED OUT OF HOMES
 AND SOME PEOPLE ARE FALLING
 THROUGH THE CRACKS.
 IN SEATTLE, AMAZON IS BASED,
 HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH
 HOMELESSNESS, AND WILL THOSE
 PROBLEMS BECOME OURS?
 HERE IS PEGGY FOX.
 Reporter: IN ORDER TO
 UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT
 ON HOMELESSNESS IN THE DC AREA,
 WE WENT OUT WEST TO SEATTLE
 WHERE THE PROBLEM IS GETTING
 WORSE.
 LITERALLY NOTHING.
 IN SEATTLE, YOU WILL FIND A
 LANDSCAPE LITTERED WITH TENTS.
 WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE
 FALLEN INTO HOMELESSNESS OR ARE
 AT THE VERY EDGE OF BECOMING
 HOMELESS BECAUSE OF RENT
 INCREASES.
 HERE IS A QUESTION FOR THE
 DC AREA, WILL AMAZON BRING WITH
 IT A RISING HOMELESS
 POPULATION?
 IN ARLINGTON COUNTY, OFFICIALS
 SAY THEY ARE WAY AHEAD OF THE
 GAME IN CURBING HOMELESSNESS
 OVER THE LAST 8 YEARS, THEY
 HAVE REDUCED IT BY 64%.
 WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU
 HAVE TO MOVE SOMEWHERE FROM
 HOMELESSNESS INTO A HOME,
 THAT'S 45 TO 50,000 IF YOU ARE
 ON THE STREETS AND IT COSTS
 ABOUT $20,000 IF WE PUT THEM
 INTO HOUSING.
 WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT MORE
 IS ABOUT THE IMPACT ON
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE, IN
 ARLINGTON COUNTY.
 OUR IDEA, MY IDEA IS TO GROW
 THE HOUSING SUPPLY RIGHT NOW
 BEFORE THEY EVEN COME.
 TONIGHT AT 11:00, PEGGY
 VISITS A VIRGINIA GROUP WITH A
 HIGH SUCCESS RATE OF FINDING
 HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS AND
 LEARNS WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE
 ABOUT THE AMAZON EFFECT HERE IN
 OUR AREA.
 WHAT IS THE ONE THING TO
 KNOW ABOUT THE FORECAST?
 YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT IT
 WILL BE MUCH COOLER TODAY AFTER
 HIGHS YESTERDAY, WE ARE IN THE
 50s WITH SHOWERS AT THE 2:00.
 MEMBER THE HORRIBLE CRASH ON
 I-695, NOW A TWEET ABOUT IT, WE
 HAVE AN ACCIDENT IN THE EXACT
 SAME PLACE NOW.
 SOUTHEAST SOUTHWEST FREEWAY
 PASSING BY THE THIRD STREET
 TUNNEL, LOOK FOR AN ACCIDENT
 AND DELAYS ARE NOT THERE YET,
 BUT THEY WILL GO PRETTY
 QUICKLY.
 IT IS TIME FOR THE MOST EASY
 THING WE FEATURE THE PHOTOS AND
 VIDEOS AND STORIES THAT YOU
 WOULD ONLY SEE IN THIS GREAT
 CITY.
 TODAY COMES FROM CARLESS.
 CARLESS IS A PHOTO OF A JACKIE
 SLATER RAMS JERSEY AS A
 REPLACEMENT WINDOW OF A CAR.
 I AM A LITTLE OFFENDED, HOW IS
 THIS THE MOST DC THINK?
 IS THIS BECAUSE WE ARE CITY
 HOPPING ON BANDWAGONS?
 I THINK MOST PEOPLE WERE
 GRANDSTANDING ON SUNDAY, BUT
 CAN YOU BLAME US?
 EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF NEW ENGLAND
 AND ORLEANS WAS GUILTY OF THAT.
 IF YOU SEE ANY MORE BANDWAGON
 FANS, SEND IT MY WAY,
 ESPECIALLY COWBOYS FANS, THAT,
 I WANT TO KNOW, I'M AT REESE
 WATERS ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK
 AND EMAIL OUR WATERS AT
 WUSA9.COM.
 YOU CAN USE THE HASHTAG TO GET
 UP  DC.
 WE DON'T HAVE ANY COWBOYS FANS
 IN HERE, DO WE?
 THEY USED TO BEING QUIET
 BECAUSE THEY ARE USED TO BEING
 IN THE WATER.
 JUST HAD, I GIVE YOU MY
 CLOSING REMARKS ON THE STATE OF
 THE UNION.
 AND LET'S GIVE SOME MORE LOVE

 THIS MONTH, WE ARE PUTTING YOUR HEALTH FIRST, IT'S PART OF
 OUR MONTH-LONG HEALTH MATTERS
 SERIES THAT RAISES AWARENESS
 ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
 CHECKUPS AND KNOWING YOUR BODY.
 WITH FEBRUARY BEING AMERICAN
 HEART MONTH, WE SAT DOWN WITH
 ONE HEART ATTACK SURVIVOR WHO
 DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE WHEN IT
 HAPPENED AND SHE IS THANKFUL TO
 BE ALIVE.
 YOU HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE A
 MONTH BEFORE YOUR BIRTHDAY,
 THAT'S A REAL WAKE-UP CALL.
 CHRISTOPHER ROBIN WAS A FEW
 WEEKS SHY OF HIS 52nd BIRTHDAY
 WHEN HE EXPERIENCED THE MOST
 TERRIFYING MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE.
 AROUND MIDNIGHT, HAD THIS
 INCREDIBLE SENSATION IN MY ARMS
 AND CHEST.
 IT'S AS IF SOMEONE WAS TAKING
 THEIR NAILS AND JUST RAKING
 THROUGH MY ARM INSIDE AND THERE
 WAS NOTHING I COULD DO ABOUT IT.
 HE FELT A SIMILAR FEELING
 BEFORE, BUT THIS TIME IT WAS
 DIFFERENT, IT WAS SCARY.
 HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
 IT WAS WORKING ITS WAY DOWN
 BOTH BICEPS INTO MY FOREARMS.
 THAT IS WHEN I KNEW I WAS
 PRETTY MUCH IN TROUBLE.
 I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE IT AS WHAT
 I CALL THE REAPER'S EMBRACE.
 IT WAS PRETTY TERRIFYING, AND I
 SAID GOD, I'M NOT READY TO
 CHECK OUT, BUT I CAN'T AFFORD
 TO CHECK IN BECAUSE I DON'T
 HAVE HEALTHCARE.
 Reporter: BETWEEN JOBS AND
 WORRIED ABOUT EXPENSIVE, HE WAS
 TRYING TO SURVIVE.
 HE WAS RUSHED TO RESTON CENTER
 WHERE HE LEARNED ABOUT
 BLOCKAGES IN AN ARTERY AND IS
 ALL TUBE CALLED STENTS WAS
 INSERTED TO IMPROVE BLOOD FLOW.
 IF YOU HAVE CHECKUPS AND
 IT'S COVERED, GO AT LEAST EVERY
 SIX MONTHS ESPECIALLY AFTER THE
 AGE OF 40, BECAUSE THE
 LIKELIHOOD OF YOU HAVING A
 SITUATION LIKE I'VE HAD IS
 GOING TO BE GREATER AND
 GREATER.
 IS MEDICAL BILLS REACHED
 CLOSE TO A WHOPPING $90,000,
 BUT GET THIS, HE APPLIED FOR A
 CHARITY PROGRAM AT RESTON
 HOSPITAL CENTER THAT WAIVED
 SOME OF THE EXPENSES.
 GETTING TESTS TO CHECK ON YOUR
 HEALTH CAN BE EXPENSIVE, SO WE
 PARTNER WITH THE SAME HOSPITAL
 THAT HELPED SAVE HIM TO MAKE IT
 EASIER TO SAVE YOU.
 WE OFFER TWO FREE SESSIONS
 TOMORROW, ONE AT SEVEN IN THE
 MORNING UNTIL NOON AND THE
 SECOND SESSION WILL BE FROM
 2:00 UNTIL 7:00 P.M.
 BOTH AT THE YMCA FAIRFAX COUNTY
 IN RESTON ON SUNSET HILLS ROAD.
 WHILE FREE, WE WANT YOU TO
 REGISTER.
 JUST GO TO WUSA9.COM/ HEALTH
 MATTERS.
 LOTS OF GOOD STUFF HAPPENING,
 GIVE ME MORE GOOD NEWS.
 WE HAVE COOL WEATHER AND
 SHOWERS TODAY.
 WE HAD 70s YESTERDAY AND TODAY
 WILL BE IN THE 50s ACROSS THE
 AREA AND 47 AS YOU STEP OUTSIDE
 IN DC.
 THE FRONT STALLS ACROSS THE
 AREA AND THAT'S THE MAIN REASON
 FOR RAIN TODAY.
 WE HAVE SHOWERS OVER THE ROMNEY
 AND CUMBERLAND AREA AND BY 5:00
 OR 6:00, THE RAIN MAKES ITS WAY
 INTO THE METRO DC AREA AND
 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE
 ISSUED THE YELLOW WEATHER
 ALERT.
 THE EVENING DRIVE WILL BE
 SLOWER WITH THE RAIN OUT THERE.
 8:00 IN EVENING AND RAIN IS
 ACROSS THE AREA.
 LATER TONIGHT, WE GET A BREAK
 FROM THE SHOWERS AND TO KEEP
 THE RAIN CHANCE IN THE FORECAST
 FOR THURSDAY AS WELL, AND HIS
 WHAT WE THINK TODAY, 48 TO 55
 DEGREES WITH SHOWERS AND IT IS
 CLOUDY OVER THE NEXT 12 HOURS,
 YOU FIND A BETTER CHANCE FOR
 RAIN IN THE EVENING AND BY 7
 PM, RIGHT AT 50 DEGREES AND
 UPPER 40s THROUGHOUT THE REST
 OF THE EVENING AND AFTERNOON.
 MUCH COOLER TODAY VERSUS
 YESTERDAY.
 A STRONGER COLD FRONT COMES IN
 FRIDAY.
 WE TOP OUT IN THE 60s ON
 FRIDAY, BUT LOOK AT THE COLD
 AIR ON THE BACK OF IT.
 BY SATURDAY, A HIGH OF ONLY 39
 AND 41 ON SUNDAY.
 REALLY QUICK, WE HAVE A CHANCE
 FOR SOME WINTER WEATHER THAT
 WILL COME OF REARING ITS HEAD
 BACK INTO THE AREA.
 THAT WILL BE NEXT WEEK.
 THIS IS MONDAY, A CHANCE FOR
 SNOW AND RAIN AND LOOKING AT
 THE MODELS AND LATEST TRENDS
 PUTS US IN A WARMER SCENARIO
 THAT WOULD GIVE MORE RAIN
 AROUND DC AND THE RAIN AND SNOW
 LINE HAS MOVED, IT'S FURTHER
 SOUTH, NOW IT'S FURTHER TO THE
 NORTH.
 THIS WILL LOOK LIKE LESS SNOW
 AROUND THE AREA ON MONDAY AND
 ON TUESDAY, THE LATEST TREND IS
 TO GIVE US A MIX.
 BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE BULK OF
 THIS STAYS TO THE SOUTH.
 SOUTHERN SUBURBS WOULD HAVE A
 BETTER CHANCE OF PICKING UP ON
 SNOW OUT OF THIS.
 WE ARE A WEEK AWAY, BUT WE
 STILL HAVE TIME TO FINE-TUNE
 THE FORECAST AND JUST KNOW THAT
 WINTER WEATHER IS NOT GOING TO
 GO AWAY QUIETLY.
 IT WILL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.
 65 TOMORROW IN 60s ON FRIDAY
 AND 39 ON SATURDAY AND 41 ON
 SATURDAY AND WE HAVE THE MIX.
 A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 THE ACCIDENT ON SOUTHEAST
 SOUTHWEST FREEWAY, TODAY IS THE
 EAST BOUND LANE.
 THIS IS A LOOK AT THE 14th
 STREET BRIDGE WHERE WE SEE
 DELAYS IF YOU TRIED TO HEAD
 AROUND THE 14th STREET BRIDGE
 AND GO TO 395, THAT SOUTHWEST
 FREEWAY BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT
 BY THE THIRD STREET TUNNEL AND
 WE HAVE A CLOSURE ON ROUTE 15
 IN BOTH DIRECTIONS BY MOUNT
 BILL WROTE IN A CLOSURE ON
 ROUTE ONE IN VIRGINIA HEADING
 SOUTHBOUND.
 AND THIS ONE IS NEW AND ANOTHER
 CLOSURE, THREE CLOSURES ON
 ROUTE FIVE IN ST. MARY'S
 HEADING SOUTHBOUND TO THREE
 NOTCH ROAD, THIS IS ONE WHERE
 WE HAD THE PHOTO SENT OUT BY
 THE MECHANICSVILLE FIRE
 DEPARTMENT WHO SAID A COMMUTER
 BUS AND UTILITY TRUCK WERE
 INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT AND
 TWO PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN ONE
 OF THEM WAS A MEDEVAC FROM THE
 SCENE WHICH MEANS PRETTY
 SERIOUS ENTRIES.
 NO ON
      I'm a concrete mason.
  I had severe fatigue, went to            a doctor.
      Became diagnosed with       Hodgkin's lymphoma.
     I had to put my trust in            somebody.
   We recommended chemotherapy, and then a stem cell transplant.
  When his disease progressed,
   I thought that he would be a          good candidate
        for immunotherapy
   to unleash his immune system       against the cancer.
    I'm back to working hard.
  I've honestly have never felt           this great.
   The evolution of cancer care            is here.

          WITH RECURRING   CONSTIPATION AND BELLY PAIN
       TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
    AND SAY YESSS! TO LINZESS.

              YESSS!
  LINZESS TREATS ADULTS WITH IBS
        WITH CONSTIPATION
     OR CHRONIC CONSTIPATION.
     LINZESS CAN HELP RELIEVE         YOUR BELLY PAIN
 AND LETS YOU HAVE MORE FREQUENT  AND COMPLETE BOWEL MOVEMENTS.
    LINZESS IS NOT A LAXATIVE.
     IT WORKS DIFFERENTLY TO    HELP YOU GET AHEAD OF YOUR
      RECURRING CONSTIPATION         AND BELLY PAIN.
       DO NOT GIVE LINZESS     TO CHILDREN LESS THAN 6,
  AND IT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO   CHILDREN 6 TO LESS THAN 18,
        IT MAY HARM THEM.
      DO NOT TAKE LINZESS IF    YOU HAVE A BOWEL BLOCKAGE.
        GET IMMEDIATE HELP          IF YOU DEVELOP
 UNUSUAL OR SEVERE STOMACH PAIN,
         ESPECIALLY WITH     BLOODY OR BLACK STOOLS.
  THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECT IS   DIARRHEA, SOMETIMES SEVERE.
     IF IT'S SEVERE,
     STOP TAKING LINZESS AND   CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY.
 OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE GAS,
 STOMACH-AREA PAIN, AND SWELLING.
      SO SAY YESSS!
           TO HELP FOR     RECURRING CONSTIPATION.
  YESSS! TO HELP FOR BELLY PAIN.
       TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
     AND SAY YESSS! LINZESS.

         It hasn't always        been easy, has it?

       There have been days    when you doubted yourself.

        And days when you       were ready to quit.

         But you didn't.

  Because you had the courage to venture into something powerful.
            Education.
     If I leave you with just      three words of advice:
     never...stop...growing.
            [cheering]
 IT IS 6:53 AND 45 DEGREES. HERE IS A WRAPUP OF THE STORIES
 STARTING WITH MATT.
 Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP
 USED THE SECOND STATE OF THE
 UNION AS A RALLYING CRY BUT TO
 EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR BORDER
 SECURITY AND A TALK ABOUT A
 SECOND MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN
 IN NORTH KOREA.
 AND DEMOCRATS HIT BACK SAYING
 ANY UNITY THAT IS NOT THERE,
 ANY DISCORD COMES FROM THE
 PRESIDENT, HIMSELF.
 LET'S CHECK IN WITH OUR
 QUESTION ONE LAST TIME, DO YOU
 THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP'S STATE
 OF THE UNION ADDRESS WILL HELP
 UNITE BOTH PARTIES?
 RESULTS ON THE SCREEN, MOST OF
 YOU SAY IT NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
 WE WILL SEE TEMPERATURES
 THAT WILL BE MUCH COOLER,
 HIGHER AT 53 WITH SHOWERS AND
 THE BEST TIME FOR THE SHOWERS
 IS AFTER 2:00 TODAY.
 395 IS SLOW OVER THE 14th
 STREET BRIDGE BECAUSE OF THE
 CRASH ON SOUTHEAST SOUTHWEST
 FREEWAY RIGHT AT THE 19th
 STREET TUNNEL.
 THE RAMP CLOSED, AND ROUTE 5 S.
 IN ST. MARY'S BY THREE NOTCH
 ROAD, ROUTE 15 IN FREDERICK AND
 NORTH AND SOUTH FIND LANES,
 SOUTHBOUND LANES AND CONSTANT
 CODE ROAD.
 IT IS TIME FOR MY FINAL
 THOUGHT.
 AS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE
 SHOW, PRESENT AND DELIVERED THE
 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS LAST
 NIGHT.
 THE PRESIDENT STARTED THE NIGHT
 ON A CONCILIATORY TONE URGING
 FOR BIPARTISANSHIP AND
 COLLABORATION.
 A QUOTE THAT STATED OUT TO ME
 IS WHEN HE SAID VICTORY IS NOT
 WINNING FOR OUR PARTY, VICTORY
 IS WINNING FOR OUR COUNTRY.
 WHILE THE SPEECH WAS PEPPERED
 WITH RED MEAT FOR THE
 PRESIDENT'S BASE LIKE ABORTION
 AND THE IMMIGRANT CARAVAN,
 THERE WERE ALSO MOMENTS OF
 REPROACH BUT LIKE THIS CALL FOR
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND
 LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS AND
 BETTER JOBS FOR ALL AMERICANS.
 I KNOW THAT NO SPEECH CAN TOUCH
 ON EVERYTHING, BUT I WAS
 DISAPPOINTED NOT TO HEAR
 ANYTHING ABOUT MASS SHOOTINGS
 AND CHILD SEPARATIONS AT THE
 BORDER INTO DIRECT DENIAL OF
 THE CHARGES IN THE ROBERT
 MUELLER INVESTIGATION.
 THOSE ARE THREE OF THE MOST
 HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SCANDALS IF
 NOT THE THREE MOST HIGHLY
 PUBLICIZED SCANDALS IN RECENT
 MONTHS.
 NOTHING WAS IMPERATIVE FOR THE
 PRESENT TO USE THE HUGE
 PLATFORM TO EASE PEOPLE'S VERY
 REAL FEARS AND ADDRESS THE VERY
 REAL ANGER.
 BUT STILL MY VERY BIGGEST
 DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE OMISSION
 OF THOSE WORKERS AFFECTED BY
 THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 MOST GOVERNMENT WORKERS ARE
 DEALING WITH REPERCUSSIONS OF
 THE FIRST SHUTDOWN AS THE
 COUNTRY STANDS ON THE EDGE,
 BRACING ITSELF AROUND 2.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP PUNTED ON
 GIVING REASSURANCES AND LEFT
 GOVERNMENT WORKERS IN LIMBO.
 THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.
 THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO KEEP OUR
 GOVERNMENT RUNNING DESERVE
 BETTER, LIKE ANY STATE THAT THE
 UNION, GUESTS WERE FLOWN IN
 FROM THE FAR REACHES OF THIS
 COUNTRY TO REPRESENT OUR
 COLLECTIVE STRUGGLES.
 NO FLIGHT WAS NECESSARY AND NO
 HOTEL NEEDED.
 THEY ARE RIGHT HERE.
 THE PEOPLE YOU SEE EVERY DAY
 KEEPING OUR DEMOCRACY IN
 WORKING ORDER.
 JUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE NEVER
 FAR FROM OUR THOUGHTS ON GET UP
 DC AND YOUR STRUGGLES WILL
 NEVER GO IGNORED.
