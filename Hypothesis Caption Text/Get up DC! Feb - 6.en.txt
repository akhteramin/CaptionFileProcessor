Let's see. Most of you say lower A1C. But only a few of you are thinking about your heart. Fact is, even though it helps to manage A1C, type 2 diabetes still increases your risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke. JARDIANCE is the first type 2 diabetes pill with a lifesaving cardiovascular benefit for adults who have type 2 diabetes and heart disease, JARDIANCE significantly reduces the risk of dying from a cardiovascular event and lowers A1C, with diet and exercise. Let's give it another try. <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i> <i> serious side effects</i> <i> including dehydration.</i> <i> This may cause you</i> <i> to feel dizzy, faint,</i> <i> or lightheaded,</i> <i> or weak upon standing.</i> <i> Ketoacidosis</i> <i> is a serious side effect</i> <i> that may be fatal.</i> <i> Symptoms include nausea,</i> <i> vomiting, stomach pain,</i> <i> tiredness,</i> <i> and trouble breathing.</i> <i> A rare but life-threatening</i> <i> bacterial infection</i> <i> in the skin of the genital</i> <i> area could also occur.</i> <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> and call your doctor right away</i> <i> if you have symptoms</i> <i> of this bacterial infection,</i> <i> ketoacidosis</i> <i> or an allergic reaction.</i> <i> Symptoms of an allergic</i> <i> reaction include rash,</i> <i> swelling, and difficulty</i> <i> breathing or swallowing.</i> <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i> <i> if you are on dialysis</i> <i> or have severe kidney problems.</i> <i> Other side effects are</i> <i> sudden kidney problems,</i> <i> genital yeast infections,</i> <i> increased bad cholesterol,</i> <i> and urinary tract infections,</i> <i> which may be serious.</i> <i> Taking JARDIANCE with</i> <i> a sulfonylurea or insulin</i> <i> may cause low blood sugar.</i> <i> Tell your doctor about</i> <i> all the medicines you take</i> <i> and if you have any</i> <i> medical conditions.</i> Isn't it time to rethink your type 2 diabetes medication? Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE and get to the heart of what matters.
