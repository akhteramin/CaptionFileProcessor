 THIS IS "DAILY BLAST LIVE." WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT
 THIS.
 ALWAYS LIVE, ALWAYS REAL,
 ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE.
 YOU ARE TOTALLY OFF BASE
 HERE.
 LOG ON AND JOIN OUR LIVE
 CONVERSATION.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING
 THIS.
 I DO AGREE WITH YOU.
 "DBL" STARTS RIGHT NOW.
 THREE, TWO --
 WELCOME TO "DBL."
 IT'S WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 13th.
 WE ARE LIVE AND WE'RE TALKING
 ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
 ABOUT.
 I'M HERE WITH TORY, AL, JEFF
 AND I'M SAM.
 WE HAVE DR. DREW.
 YOU'RE NOT ONLY A FRIEND BUT MY
 MENTOR.
 THERE'S A REASON WE WORK
 WITH YOU.
 YOU'RE GOOD.
 THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.
 EMERGENCY FALLOUT.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,
 DR. DREW.
 WE BEGIN WITH A STORY WE'VE
 BEEN TRACKING.
 HE JUSSIE'S REPS SAID CHICAGO
 PD FIND HIS STORY CONSISTENT AND
 CREDIBLE.
 THIS COME HAS DAY AFTER A
 SPOKESPERSON SAID THE KNOWN
 RECORDS DO NOT MEET THE BURDEN
 FOR A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
 HAS THEY WERE LIMITED AND
 HEAVILY REACTED.
 JUSSIE'S REPS CLAIM INFORMATION
 WAS REMOVED TO PROVENT OTHERS
 WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
 ATTACK.
 CHECK OUT THIS TEASER.
 AT ANY POINT DURING THE
 ATTACK DID YOU FEAR FOR YOUR
 ATTACK?
 YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING IT.
 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THE
 NARRATIVE?
 IT'S NOT OUR JOB TO CREATE A
 NARRATIVE.
 IF HE HAS OVERSTATED IT, I'M
 STILL WORRIED.
 SO ALL OF US SIT BACK.
 IT'S NOT OUR BUSINESS.
 TORY, YOU HAVE A STRONG
 TAKE.
 INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN
 GUILTY.
 IF IT'S NOT TRUE, DR. DREW IS
 RIGHT, THERE MAY BE SOMETHING
 ELSE WRONG.
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING.
 I MEAN TOM BRADY DIDN'T GIVE UP
 HIS PHONE WHEN IT'S DEFLATE-
 GATE AND WE'RE JUMPING ON THIS
 GUY.
 ANYTHING WE GET FROM THE
 STORY WILL PUSH THE NARRATIVE.
 THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE FROM
 DIVISION.
 UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S THE WORLD
 WE LIVE IN.
 THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS SAY
 YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A HOAX,
 PARKLAND, SANDY HOOK, PIZZA
 GATE.
 EVERYBODY, UNFORTUNATELY HAS A
 FINANCIAL INTEREST.
 I GUARANTEE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
 NOT FANS OF HIS AND DO CARE
 ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL WELL-BEING.
 THEY JUST SEE THE KID AS A WAY
 IT FURTHER THEIR AGENDA.
 I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF
 YOU THINK THERE ARE HOLES IN
 HIS STORY, WHICH I DON'T, WAIT
 FOR THE INTERVIEW.
 WE WILL BE COVERING THE
 INTERVIEW TOMORROW.
 THE MEDIA CREATES NARRATIVE.
 THOSE HEADLINES, THAT'S FOR THE
 GOOD OF THE NARRATIVE.
 THEY WANT IT MAKE MONEY.
 BE AN INDIVIDUAL THINKER AND
 CHIME IN "DBL" NATION.
 WE FINALLY HAVE GOOD NEWS
 COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON, D.C.
 MANY.
WE ARE TWO DAYS AWAY FROM A
 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS CAME UP
 WITH A TENTATIVE DEAL.
 SOURCES SAY HE IS EXPECTED TO
 SIGN IT.
 IN THE MEANTIME TED CRUZ IS
 BACKING ANOTHER PLAN.
 CRUZ SAID WE SHOULD USE THE
 MONEY U.S. PROSECUTORS ARE
 SEEKING FROM NOW CONVICTED EL
 CHAPO.
 THEY'RE SEEKING $14 BILLION IN
 PROFLTS AND CRUZ SAID THAT
 MONEY SHOULD GO TOWARD SECURITY
 BORDER.
 WELL, WE HAVE A NEW TO DOG.
 MEET KING THE FOX TERRIER.
 I CALLED IT THE BEST IN SHOW
 LAMPS NIGHT AT THE WESTMINSTER
 DOG SHOW.
 COMPETITION WAS ROUGH.
 THE FOX TERRIER WON THE TOP
 PRIZE.
 THIS MARKS THE 15th TIME THAT
 BREED HAS COME OUT ON TOP.
 THE LONG HAIRED DACHSHUND DID
 NOT WIN.
 AND THE SKIPPER WHO WON THE
 NONSPORTING GROUP WAS
 DISQUALIFIED.
 SCANDAL.
 DUE TO A CONFLICT OF
 INTEREST.
 I THOUGHT I WAS BACK IN
 FRANCE.
 AND THIS SUSSEX SPANIEL
 NAMED BEAN WHO WON THE SPORTING
 GROUP AND MEET WILMA THE BOXER,
 BUT IT WASN'T JUST US HUMANS.
 CHECK OUT ALL THESE DOGS WHO
 REALLY GOT INTO THE ACTION.
 TORY, I KNOW, FIRST OF ALL,
 SCANDAL.
 BIG SCANDAL.
 SKIPPER KEY WAS IN IT.
 THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH THE JUDGE
 AND SAID I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.
 THAT IS SCANDAL, AM I RIGHT?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 BECAUSE THE JUDGE WAS A CO-
 OWNER OF SAID DOG.
 SHOULDN'T THAT BE ILL LOCAL?
 THIS WAS.
 HE DID A NICE LAUGH AND WALKED.
 THE BEARDED GUY THAT LOOKS
 LIKE SHERLOCKS, HE LOOKS LIKE A
 DOG.
 AT SOME POINT THAT DOG WAS ON.
 HE STOOD LIKE THIS AND HE, THE
 CROWD.
 CAN I GET A ONE IS THE ON
 TORY WHEN SHE DOES THAT.
 THIS IS THE DACHSHUND, ONE SHOT
 ON TORY.
 PLEASE DON'T PUT ME IN IT.
 IT WAS MADISON SQUARE
 GARDEN, THANK YOU.
 LOOK AT JEFF.
 WE COVERED THIS STORY MORE
 THAN THE SUPER BOWL.
 CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN WHY I
 WATCH IT EVERY YEAR AFTER THE
 MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE.
 THEY SHOULD HAVE RESCUE DOGS
 ONLY.
 THEY CALL IT THE ONE PEOPLE
 DON'T WASH EYE LIKE THE
 BEAUTIFUL DOGS.
 COME ON.
 IT DOESN'T MOON YOU HAVE TO BUY
 ONE.

 ABOUT LOVE AND RELATIONSHIP AND
 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T MESS WITH
 SINGER MIRANDA LAMBERT.
 PLUS, ACTOR ANSON WILSON TELLS
 US ABOUT HAPPY DAYS AND'S
 SQUIRE MAGAZINE IS IN THE
 CENTER OF A FIRE STORM OVER
 THIS COVER.

 WELCOME BACK TO "DBL." I WOULD HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST.
 YOU KNOW HIM FROM LOVE LINE AND
 CELEBRITY -- IT'S DR. DREW
 PINSKY.
 THIS IS IMPORTANT.
 A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS AT HOME,
 YOU LOVE HIS ADVICE ON
 ADDICTION AND RELATIONSHIPS BUT
 TODAY WE'RE FOCUSING ON
 RELATIONSHIPS AND ASKED VIEWERS
 TO SEND IN FOR A SEGMENT WE'RE
 CALLING DEAR DR. DREW DBL.
 ONE PERSON MY BEDROOM LIFE
 WITH MY GIRLFRIEND  SUCKS.
 THREE TIME AS WEEK IF I'M
 LUCKY.
 THREE TIMES A WEEK ABOVE
 AVERAGE BY THE WAY.
 THAT'S ABOVE AVERAGE?
 YES.
 AVERAGE IN A LONG TERM
 RELATIONSHIP.
 WHAT ABOUT A NEW
 RELATIONSHIP.
 SOME PEOPLE ARE AT THAT
 RATE.
 THAT'S FOR SURE.
 PEOPLE HAVE TO REACH A
 COMPROMISE.
 MORNING AND NIGHT, JEFF.
 I LOVE SLEEP.
 IT'S ABOUT COMPROMISING.
 YOU HAVE TO TELL HER THIS IS
 NOT YOUR RATE AND YOU HAVE TO
 STEP IT UP.
 ONE OF THE THINGS I SEE
 COMMONLY IN YOUNG COUPLES WHEN
 A FEMALE SEXUAL DESIRE DOES NOT
 MATCH A MAN SHE MAY BE ON A
 HIGH PROJEST TER PRONE BIRTH
 CONTROL.
 SO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIRTH
 CONTROL.
 THE PROGESTERONE.
 THIS GUY.
 HE'S LIKE A FOUNTAIN OF
 KNOWLEDGE.
 ELLIE SAYS MY HUSBAND
 GAMBLES COMPULSIVELY AND
 FREQUENTS GENTLEMEN'S CLUBS.
 WE ARE DROWNING IN DEBT.
 SHOULD I WALK OUT.
 ELLIE MAE, LIKE FROM THE
 BEVERLY HILLBILLIES?
 THIS IS A TRAGEDY AND THIS IS A
 GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW REAL
 GAMBLING ADDICTION DESTROYS
 LIFE.
 THERE COULD BE SEXUAL
 ADDICTION.
 GO TO AL-ANON.
 THERE'S SPECIFIC ONES FOR
 GAMBLING AND SEX ACTS BUT AL-
 ANONIS EASY TO FIND.
 HE GETS TREATMENT OR YOU LEAVE.
 ANOTHER WE BOTH PEOPLE
 STRONGLY.
 SHE'S NOT READY FOR A
 RELATIONSHIP.
 WE CAN'T STOP SEEING EACH
 OTHER.
 IT FEELS LIKE A REBOUND.
 I HAVE TO FINISH, DOES HE GO
 TO GA, GAMBLING'S ANONYMOUS.
 OR SEX ACTS AEN IN ANONYMOUS.
 WHEN SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH A
 DIVORCE YOU'RE MORE OF A LIFE
 PRESERVER WHEN SOMEONE'S GOING
 THROUGH A HORRIBLE CRISIS.
 I WOULD NEED A WHOLE LOT MORE
 INFORMATION.
 COULD IT WORK OUT?
 I COULD BUT I HAVE BAD
 FEELINGS ABOUT THIS.
 INTERESTING.
 I JUST READ RUTH.
 TREVOR IN TAMPA SAID MY
 GIRLFRIEND GETS MAD AT ME FOR
 NOT POSTING PICTURES OF US ON
 SOCIAL MEDIA.
 I LIKE TO POST ABOUT MY
 HOBBIES, SHE THINKS I'M HIDING
 SOMETHING.
 THAT'S A RELATABLE ONE.
 YOU, SIR NEED TO STEP UP
 BECAUSE SHE'S LETTING YOU KNOW
 SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT COULD
 MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY.
 WHY WOULDN'T YOU IF IT WOULD
 MAKE HER FEEL GOOD.
 IF SHE'S SOMEONE YOU LOVE, WHY
 WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT.
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR
 DYSFUNCTION HALL FAMILY?
 I'M MOSTLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU
 AND SAM, JEFF.
 WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOVE
 NORMAL IN CERTAIN AREAS.
 I GET THAT A LOT.
 FIVE MINUTES AGO.

 PEOPLE ARE SAYING ESQUIRE
