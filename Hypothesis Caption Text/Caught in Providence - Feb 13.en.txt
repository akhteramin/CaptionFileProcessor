the technical defense. I was at my apartment, I don't live there. 
- No. 
- You could easily have said, I co-hosted the party, and I told the police that and that's why I'm here. So, baby, you had to bring your mother to court today, huh? 
- I did. 
- Are you still spoon-feeding him or not? Did you know that you could not park there with a placard? 
- I only parked there 30 seconds. 
- You were there 30 seconds? 
- 30-45 seconds, ah... 
- You keep talking, they're gonna take your handicap placard away. 
- This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio, where people and cases are met with compassion. A different kind of judge. A courtroom like no other. This is Caught in Providence. 
- Nicholas Damon. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- Okay, Mr. Damon, you're charged with going through a red light on Roger Williams Avenue and Elmwood Avenue at 10:18 in the morning. Is this your lawyer with you? 
- This is my mother. 
- I'm his mom. 
- When are you gonna stop taking care of these kids? 
- I don't know. 
- How long does it take before you cut the cord? 
- Never. 
- Never. 
- Never. 
- That's a good answer. 
- Now... this is a classic case, Inspector Quinn, of a mother coming to court for her little boy. 
- Yup, it's her baby. She's here for her baby. 
- She's here for her baby. I have to go to court for my baby. Do you have any younger than him? 
- No, no. 
- No, only child. 
- So he's your baby. 
- He's my baby, yeah, he's my only one. 
- So, baby, you had to bring your mother to court today, huh? 
- I did, I did. Hopefully it helps. 
- Are you still spoon-feeding him or not? 
- No. 
- No? Well, he's... he's charged with going through a red light. We're gonna look at it. 
- Good. 
- What is your name? 
- Kerri. 
- Kerri. 
- Damon. 
- Damon. Well, come up here. Come up here, come up here. 
- You know, it's not gonna end well for you, so get rid of that smile. 
- Get over here. 
- Okay. 
- We're gonna-
- you've gotta give me a hand on deciding this case, okay? 
- Okay, all right. 
- You've gotta be honest. 
- I will be honest, yeah. 
- All right. 
- No special leniency. 
- No special leniency. 
- All right, so, okay, so-
- 
- He hasn't had any... 
- All right, so I'm gonna get over here, you're gonna get over here, and we're gonna look at the video right here. Okay, Lisa, let's go. The light is red. And... 
- Uh... I thought it was a right on red. 
- Hold on for a minute. The light is red. He's coming down. And he made a right-hand turn. Okay, now, what do you wanna tell me about that? 
- Well, he did have his brakes on. And it was a slow, it was a slow... 
- You... you can take a right turn on red over there. It does have a sign that says-
- 
- I'm talking to your mother. 
- All right, all right, sorry. 
- Be careful. 
- I guess it was a rolling stop. 
- It was a rolling stop. You don't think he stopped. 
- Um... No, he didn't stop completely, no. 
- You agree with that, Inspector Quinn? 
- She took the words right out of my mouth, Judge. 
- Yeah? So what do you think we should do with him? 
- Um... I don't know, I've done a lot to him already and screamed at him about it, and I-
- I don't-
- 
- Did you beat him up? 
- I didn't beat him up. No, I couldn't... 
- Wanna use this? 
- I could use this. 
- All right. Like every mother, like every mother, right, she sees the good in her son, right? You're still her little baby. You can make a right-hand turn on red. At this location you had to stop. Your mother says your brakes were on and that you came to a rolling stop, so the question is-
- she's making an impassioned plea that you made an attempt to stop and that it was a close call. Is that what you were saying? 
- That's what I was saying, yes. 
- So how do you wanna find him? Guilty or not guilty? 
- Uh, I would find him not guilty. 
- Surprise. It's a big surprise, Inspector Quinn. 
- I'm totally shocked on that ruling, Judge. 
- All right, I asked for it, so I guess you're gonna be found not guilty. Good luck to you. 
- Thank you so much. 
- All right, take care. 
- Daniel Ferreras. Good morning, sir. 
- Good morning. 
- You have a parking ticket on Salisbury Street. 
- Yeah. 
- This is parking in a prohibited area. Now, listen, hold on a second. All right, good. We have two mics. You are between both of them. Get to one or the other. Get close, get closer to the mic. 
- Like that? 
- Perfect. Okay, what do you wanna tell me? You have a handicap placard. 
- I missing the ticket. I... I'm no more here for that. But I go over to the... to have a handicap ticket. Says $90. It's too much for me. 
- Mr. Ferreras, a handicap... placard allows you to park in the handicap zone. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- It also allows you to park at a parking meter without putting money in the meter. 
- No have a meter, nothing like that. 
- I know. It also allows you to park in a timed zone. It does not allow you to park in a sign that says no parking. Did you know that you could not park there with the placard? 
- I only park there 30 seconds, sir. 
- You were there 30 seconds? 
- Yeah. 
- All right, wait, hold on for a minute. 
- 30 seconds is up. 
- Yes. 
- You parked that far. You get out of the car, what did you do? 
- I pick up my daughter for the house and outside, that's it. 
- You went to your daughter's house, all right... and then you came back out. 
- Yeah. 
- And that took 30 seconds. 
- From my car-
- my car is 30-
- 
- You took 30 seconds. Right, you got out, you ran and got right back in. Inspector Quinn, this guy's the fastest guy in the country. 
- I was gonna say, it takes me about 30 seconds to shut the car off, open the car door, shake it off a little bit and get out. 
- Inspector Quinn, he's got a handicap placard. You wanna give him some leniency? 
- Yes, Your Honor. We wouldn't, uh... We'll move to dismiss with the warning, advising him about the legal spot. I just wanna check the date on that handicap. 
- Mr. Ferreras, listen to me. 
- Yes. 
- All right, just so you know... ... you said it took me 30 seconds to go in the house... see my daughter and come back out. You're handicapped. 
- No, no, no, no, no, to see my daughter-
- 
- You've got a cane. 
- I put daughter back on fifth floor and go back. 
- Yeah, I know, you went in, you came back out in 30 seconds. 
- 30-45 seconds, ah... something. 
- You keep talking, they're gonna take your handicap placard away. They're gonna say you're pretty healthy. You better be careful. All right. Based on the recommendation of Inspector Quinn, the matter is dismissed. According to your admission, it was your party. 
- I mean, I guess. 
- You just told me, you co-hosted it. 
- Yeah, but it wasn't just mine. 
- Have you ever been in a court? 
- No, first time in my life, and I am excited about it. Thank you very much! Ordinary tissues left Dakota's nose sore and red. So Dad slayed the problem with Puffs Plus Lotion, instead. With lotion to soothe and softness to please. A nose in need deserves Puffs, indeed. 
- Muammer Tukar. Good morning, sir, you are charged with... 
- Good morning. 
- ... parking overnight. 
- Uh, yeah. First of all, I am sorry for my English. Uh... I am learn-
- I am-
- I am trying to learn English. If I say something wrong, I am sorry for this. 
- You can't say anything wrong here. 
- Okay. 
- Where are you from? 
- Turkey. 
- How long have you been here? 
- Uh, ten months here. 
- You're doing pretty good. 
- Thank you very much. 
- Yeah, what do you do? Are you a student? 
- I am-
- I am... studying in-
- I am student in Brown University, and I am working in labs. And today... first time, I park my car in 3:00 and after one and half hour... when I... when I come to near my car, I found a violation parking ticket and there is no sign about the no parking here because this is not own. I just-
- I want to just study in lab two hours but... and there is no sign about no parking or no overnight parking. 
- Okay. Have you ever been in a court in Turkey? 
- No, first time here. 
- First time in court? 
- First time in my life, and I am excited about it. 
- Well, we hope we give you a favorable impression of the United States judicial system. All right, so... let me explain to you what the situation is, okay? Everything you said is accurate. Everything you said. There are no signs that say you cannot park overnight, all right? And, plus, to complicate matters more, there's a sign saying you can park during certain hours, and you were not parked during those certain hours, so, in your mind, I can park here. Which makes sense to me. Except that the city has a... a set of ordinances. These are the city laws. And in here it says you cannot park overnight in Providence. So, before you came from Turkey, you were supposed to read this book. 
- Read all of that? I have just two-
- two months here. 
- So... it's a very confusing thing. People in Providence know they can't, but I don't think it's fair for us to charge you for parking overnight, when, number one, you didn't know, number two, the sign was very misleading. So that's the short version of saying that you won your case. So when you get back to Turkey, you can say, I was in the United States, and I received a summons to go to court, and I fought the system and I won. 
- Am I won now? 
- You win. 
- Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. 
- Good luck to you, the matter is dismissed. You did a-
- you did a wonderful job. 
- Thank you very much. Thank you again. 
- As many of you know, videos of our cases have been watched nearly two billion times on social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. Over half of these views come from foreign countries. Almost universally the viewers comment that they wished the court proceedings in their countries were as fair as the ones in our courtroom. While not always perfect, the United States judicial system is based on the premise that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. That's not the case everywhere. I'm pleased that we were able to demonstrate that concept in person to Mr. Tukar in the hope that he enjoys the rest of his stay in our great country. Juliana Roland. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- Good morning, Juliana. Juliana, you have a speeding ticket on Chalkstone Avenue, in a school zone. 
- Yes. 
- Is there anything you wanna tell me about? 
- Yes, Your Honor. I'm here from South Carolina. I reside in South Carolina. 
- In Lexington. 
- And-
- I'm sorry. 
- In Lexington, South Carolina. 
- No, actually, I'm in Blythewood. 
- Oh-
- 
- It was a rental vehicle. 
- Oh. 
- I have been out of the state of Rhode Island since 1994, and I was back visiting my dad-
- 88 years old. He was entering hospice that weekend. And so... I'm familiar with the area. I lived on Pembroke Avenue just, you know, north of Nathanael Greene Middle School. I'm familiar with the area. I was staying at a rental property in Providence and just picked up speed going down that hill. Didn't see the sign for the school zone. I know Nathanael Greene School is there. I've had one speed ticket in my driving life, 1991, on the New York State Thruway. I had that dismissed because I was a safe driver. I just taught my 16-year-old to drive. She was licensed last week. So, I'm asking forgiveness, if not leniency for this because I am a safe driver, and... I'm certainly guilty of the charge, but, um... 
- Well, you're one mile over what I would charge ordinarily. I have... I have an issue, not a problem. I have an issue with that-
- the location of that particular mechanism, because Chalkstone Avenue is a hill going down... 
- Yes, it is, yes, it is. 
- ... into Raymond Street, and that's where they've got the machine. So you actually would have to be pumping the brakes going down the hill to be going... to keep within the speed limit, and you were one over what I usually charge, so I'm gonna give you a break. 
- Thank you, thank you, Your Honor. 
- Is it your dad that's going into hospice? 
- He passed on June 12th, so... last time I saw him but it was good to be here. But nice gift. But thank you for dismissing, Your Honor. I appreciate it. 
- In memory of your dad. 
- Thank you, thank you-
- thanks, Dad. 
- Good luck. You actually had a pretty good morning. You know that. 
- Both tickets were not me, and I have to pay somebody else's mistake. Yeah, it's a pretty great morning. 
- I think you better leave before I change my mind. Around here, nobody ever does it. I Didn't do it. So when I heard they added Ultra Oxi to the cleaning power of Tide, it was just what we needed.

- Aga Delgado. This is a environmental summons. MC59159. Charges you with a noise violation where there was loud music coming from your house at 2:30 in the morning. 
- Yeah. 
- Where you having a party? 
- Yeah, but this actually-
- 
- What kind of a party was it? 
- This wasn't actually my house, so they kind of gave it to me by accident. They thought I lived there because it was my friend's house, and I was there at the party with everybody else, but they assumed I lived there, so they gave me the fine. The officer had told me that I could possibly fight it or get it dismissed since I am not a resident at the house. 
- So you were a guest. 
- Yeah. 
- According to the police report, the police spoke to you and you said that you were hosting the welcome-back party. Is that right? 
- No. Actually, I was co-hosting with him, so, yes, I was helping and I was, like, a part of it, but-
- 
- So you were the organizer? 
- No-
- well, it was-
- 
- You were hosting it, you were the organizer. 
- Yeah. But, I mean, I guess I really was the one who took a fall for it. 
- Yeah. So, according to your admission, it was your party. 
- I mean... I guess. 
- You just told me, you co-hosted it. 
- Yeah, but it wasn't just mine. 
- Was, uh... Martin-
- was Martin Severs also-
- 
- Yeah, he also got fined... 
- He got one too. 
- ... but his was dismissed. 
- Well, I'm not sure. I didn't dismiss it. 
- Yeah, I know, I'm just saying. 
- Inspector Quinn, you wanna be heard on this? 
- Your Honor, based on the, uh... the statements in the report, um... 
- Well, she was a little disingenuous when she first-
- when she first came out. If you had just been honest when you first came out and said-
- you know, you try to pull the technical defense. Well, I was at my apartment, I don't live there. 
- No. 
- You could have easily said, I co-hosted the party, and I told the police that and that's why I'm here. 
- I mean, I was just-
- 
- I know what you were trying to do. 
- Trying to say what they had told me, 'cause they said that. 
- I get it. Inspector Quinn? 
- Your Honor, based on the report, it would be $100 or she can have a trial. 
- You would've got a much better disposition if you had been honest from the beginning. Inspector Quinn made a recommendation. $100 fine or come back and have a trial. 
- I mean, I... 
- The matter's set down for trial. Good luck. If you wanna be trusted, you must be honest. If Ms. Delgado had simply told me the truth about her role in the party, I would have been inclined to dismiss the charges. Thomas Jefferson once said, Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom. It's also the best policy for every situation in life. Including how you behave in the courtroom. Tony Acevedo. Tony, you have three registrations. 
- Hmm? 
- Do you understand what I just said? 
- Three registrations? 
- Yes. Now, who's Maria-
- 
- That's my mother, sir. 
- Valenzuela. Are you here for her? 
- Yes, sir. 
- All right, she has an overnight parking ticket on Althea... 
- Yes, sir. 
- There's a $40 penalty. I waived the penalty. 
- Thank you. 
- So you just saved $40. You got the first ticket dismissed. Now comes the bad news. You have two red-light violations. One goes back to last year and one is... just two weeks ago. This is a ticket on North Main and Branch at 7:38 in the evening. What's the time on that? 
- .4, Your Honor. 
- All right. The next one is... on Pleasant Valley and Valley Street. Is that him making a right-hand turn? 
- Yes, Your Honor. That's no turn on red at all. 
- Was this during the period of construction? 
- Yes, Your Honor. 
- I'm gonna find-
- I'm gonna dismiss that ticket where the signs were confusing, and it will be $85 on the other. This is gonna cost you a total of $105. You actually had a pretty good morning. You know that. 
- Yeah. Yeah, compared to that both-
- both tickets were not me, and I have to pay somebody else's mistake. Yeah, it's a pretty great morning. 
- I think you better leave before I change my mind. 
- I would. I'M ALEX TREBEK HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE AGE 50-85 AND LOOKING TO BUY LIFE INSURANCE ON A FIXED BUDGET, REMEMBER THE THREE P'S. THE THREE WHAT?

- Daniel Capella. 
- Good morning, Judge. 
- Good morning, sir. All right, you have a parking meter violation. 
- Yeah, it's from my wife. Maria. 
- You're throwing your wife under the bus already. 
- She goes to Providence Power Yoga there and-
- 
- She goes to yoga? 
- Yeah. And she had to work today, so... 
- Oh, she's meditating. 
- Does yoga, does all those... 
- Yeah, but I mean she must be meditating now. She sent you-
- she sent you to court. 
- I'm gonna have to meditate for her. 
- All right, what do you wanna tell me on the merits of the case? 
- There's a parking lot there. She said she always parks in the parking lot, so she doesn't understand. 
- This one day she didn't park in the parking lot she got the ticket. 
- Yeah. 
- Now, the ticket was 25, you didn't pay it... so it went to 75. But we're gonna waive the penalties. 
- Thank you. 
- So you tell your wife that you took a really beating today in front of the judge. The judge beat you down. 
- I'm hobbling home. 
- I don't want you going home, telling your wife you paid $75 and try and get reimbursed now. 
- I wish. 
- All right, $25.
