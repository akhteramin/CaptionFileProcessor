 THE STREET. THEY DON'T CARE.
 SELLING DOPE, CRACK.
 WHATEVER.
 IT'S A BAD SITUATION.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION
 WILL BE.
 PEOPLE SHOOT UP IN THE MIDDLE
 OF THE STREET.
 WHILE THE KIDS ARE CROSSING.
 FAMILIES --
 EVERYTHING.
 WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU THOSE
 PICTURES TOMORROW.
 THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE
 LEFT.
 WE WILL NEVER BE PART OF THE
 HATE MEDIA.
 AND CONGRESSMAN, WELCOME BACKS,
 FILLING IN FOR LAURA.
 THANK YOU.
 HAVE A GOOD SHOW.
 I'M JASON CHAFFETZ IN FOR
 LAURA INGRAHAM.
 TONIGHT, THE BIGGEST REVELATION
 IN THE MUELLER REPORT NOBODY IS
 TALKING ABOUT.
 HOW THE OBAMA TEAM WAS ASLEEP AT
 THE WHEEL WHILE RUSSIA WAS ON
 THE ATTACK.
 AND WHY DID PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
 SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON IGNORE
 THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ATTACK ON
 CHRISTIANITY?
 VICTOR DAVID HANSON HERE IN
 MOMENTS.
 MEXICAN TROOPS PULL THEIR
 WEAPONS ON U.S. SOLDIERS ON OUR
 SIDE OF THE BORDER?
 WHAT SHOULD OUR RESPONSE BE?
 THAT REPORT AHEAD.
 A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SAYS HE
 WAS EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL FOR
 BEING A CONSERVATIVE.
 THE "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE"
 OBTAINED SECRET AUDIO RECORDINGS
 THAT BACK UP HIS
 FIRST, HOURS AGO, SPEAKER NANCY
 PELOSI AND HER LEADERSHIP TEAM
 TOLD DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS THAT
 THEY WON'T BE MOVING FORWARD
 WITH IMPEACHMENT.
 HOW MUCH LONGER CAN SHE HOLD
 OUT?
 WHAT THE BIG NAMES IN HER PARTY
 ARE DEMANDING HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.
 THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION
 THERE, NOT ONLY ON OBSTRUCTION
 OF JUSTICE BUT ALSO ON COLLUSION
 OR CONSPIRACY.
 WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, TO
 MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPEACHMENT ON
 THIS PRESIDENT.
 THE CONTUSION SAYS THE
 PRESIDENT ENGAGES IN THIS KIND
 OFspspspspspspACTIVITY,spspspspp
 YOU THINK THIS IS?p
 IMPEACHABLE?
 YEAH, I DO.
 EARLIER TODAY, THE LAST MAN
 YOU SAW THERE, JERRY NADLER, THE
 HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBPOENAED DON
 McGAHN.
 WHILE PELOSI IS NOT CALLING FOR
 AN IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDING, SHE'S LETTING THE
 CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY OFF
 THE LEAD.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP BUSHED OFF THE
 EFFORTS.
 ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT, MR. PRESIDENT?
 JOINING ME IS DAN BONGINO
 A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND OFF
 OF "EXONERATED" AND CHRIS HAHN,
 HOST OF "THE AGGRESSIVE
 PROGRESSIVE" PODCAST.
 THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
 YOU'RE ON FOX NEWS FREQUENTLY.
 CHRIS, CAN YOU ADMIT OUT LOUD
 THERE WAS NO COLLUSION?
 CAN YOU SAY THAT OUT LOUD?
 WELL, THE MUELLER REPORT SAYS
 THERE'S NO COLLUSION.
 I SAID I WOULD TRUST THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 I READ THE COLLUSION SECTION.
 IT APPEARS WHILE THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN WAS HAPPY TO GETTING
 THIS REPORT FROM RUSSIA, THEY
 DIDN'T FORM A CRIMINAL
 CONSPIRACY WITH THAT, SO THAT
 PART OF THE INVESTIGATION IS
 SETTLED THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE
 SHOULD HEAR ABOUT WHAT IS GOING
 ON IN PUBLIC THROUGH TESTIMONY.
 BUT THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
 PORTION, THAT IS VERY TROUBLING.
 I REMEMBER WHEN THERE THERE WAS
 A YOUNG FORMER PLACE KICKER FROM
 UTAH SITTING IN THE CHAIRS OF
 ONE OF THOSE COMMITTEES.
 HE WOULD HAVE INVESTIGATED THIS
 FULLY.
 SO I EXPECT THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES TODAY IS GOING
 TO HAVE HEARINGS AND GET THE
 WITNESSES THAT MUELLER
 INVESTIGATED TO TESTIFY IN
 PUBLIC SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED.
 BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE
 THE TRUTH.
 CHRIS, YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S
 LIKE TO HAVE IF GOAL POSTS MOVED
 ON YOU.
 THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE
 TRYING TO DO, MOVE THE GOAL
 POSTS.
 THEY BARKED ABOUT COLLUSION FOR
 TWO YEARS AND NOW IT DOESN'T
 HAPPEN.
 CHRIS IS WILLING TO ADMIT THAT
 IT'S NOT THERE.
 YEAH, BUT I FIND IT FUNNY HOW
 CHRIS THROWS IN THIS SNIDE
 REMARK THAT THEY WERE SO H TAKOA
 THEY DIDN'T GET ANY INFORMATION
 FROM RUSSIA.
 THEY SHOWED@  UP TO TALK ABOUT
 ADOPTION.
 SECONDLY, THE ONLY CAMPAIGN THAT
 WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW TOOK
 INFORMATIO RUS IS
 HILLARY CLINTON.
 BUT CHRIS LEAVES T@ @  PART OUT.
 AWFULLY CONVENIENT.
 IT'S LIKE DEM AMNE
 SECONDLY, THE OBSTRUCTION CASE
 IS GOING TO BE BIGGEST
 BOOMERANG SINCE EDDIE MURPHY'S
 BUILDING.
 JASON, DON'T FORGET THIS.
 YOU KNOW THIS BETTER THAN
 ANYONE.
 THE WAY YOU GUYS IN CONGRESS
 FOUND OUT ABOUT ALL OF THE FBI
 MALFEASANCE IN THE TRUMP CASE IS
 BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS COMPLAINED
 ABOUT THE HANDLING OF THE
 HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL
 INVESTIGATION.
 SO --
 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT --
 SO CHRIS, HOLD ON.
 NOBODY INTERRUPT ME.
 LET ME TALK.
 I DON'T INTERRUPT YOU EVER.
 LET THE DEMOCRATS KEEP OPENING
 UP THIS BOX.
 PLEASE.
 BECAUSE ONCE WE GET TO THE
 BOTTOM OF THIS, IT'S GOING TO BE
 UGLY.
 CHRIS, I WANT YOU TO RESPOND.
 BUT CHRIS, IN ADDITION TO WHAT
 DAN JUST SAID, I WANT YOU TO
 HEAR WHAT ADAM SCHIFF SAID.
 GO AHEAD.
 THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IN
 PARTICULAR IN THIS CASE IS FAR
 WORSE THAN ANYTHING THAT RICHARD
 NIXON DID.
 THE BREAK-IN BY THE RUSSIANS OF
 THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS,
 FOREIGN ADVERSARY, FAR MORE
 SIGNIFICANT THAN THE PLUMBERS
 BREAKING INTO THE DEMOCRATIC
 HEADQUARTERS.
 SO YES, THIS IS MORE SIGNIFICANT
 THAN WATERGATE.
 HE MAKES THAT CLAIM AS IF
 DONALD TRUMP DIRECTED THE
 RUSSIANS TO DO IT, WHICH IS
 TOTALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING,
 CHRIS.
 I WANT TO MAKE DAN A DEAL AND
 YOU, JASON.
 I'LL BE HAPPY TO FIND OUT IF
 THERE'S ANY REAL SPYGATE GOING
 ON AS LONG AS WE DON'T BLOCK
 SUBPOENAS TO GET McGAHN IN TO
 FIND OUT IF ANY REAL OBSTRUCTION
 OF JUSTICE HAPPENED HERE, WHICH
 I THINK DID.
 SO I'M HAPPY TO HEAR IT.
 I THINK ADAM SCHIFF IS OVER THE
 TOP THERE SAYING THIS IS WATERS
 THAN WATERGATE.
 THE OBSTRUCTION PORTION MAKES IT
 WORSE THAN ANYTHING BILL CLINTON
 WAS IMPEACHED FOR.
 I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED
 TO UNDERSTAND AND THE CHAOS
 INSIDE THAT WHITE HOUSE THE LAST
 TWO YEARS.
 ONCE THAT TRUTH GETS OUT, THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN JUDGE FOR
 THEMSELVES WHAT THEY SHOULD DO
 WITH THE PRESIDENT.
 THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WROTE
 HUNDREDS OF PAGES ABOUT THIS.
 I DOUBT THAT ADAM SCHIFF OR
 JERRY NADLER, ANY OF THESE OTHER
 PEOPLE CAN COME UP WITH
 ANYTHING.
 IF THEY HAD SOMETHING --
 I THINK HE DID PUT A PAGE
 TOGETHER.
 I READ THE RECORD.
 HE PUT A PAGE KEPT AND LEFT IT
 FOR CONGRESS TO BE THE JUDGE.
 THE OLC MEMO HAS NOT --
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 ADDRESSED THAT.
 IT'S NOT TRUE.
 I HAVE TO GO.
 ONE OTHER THING.
 I WANT TO GO TO ONE OTHER THING.
 YOU KNOW, THERE'S OTHER PARTS OF
 THIS.
 YOU HAVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS THAT IS
 PUT FORWARD A DOCUMENT THAT HE
 WANTS OUT THERE.
 THE TRUMP TEAM ACTUALLY SUED TO
 MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T
 HAPPEN.
 DAN,S THE RIGHT MOVE BY
 THE PRESIDENT?
 YOU MEAN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
 HIS FIN■ú NOW?
 YEAH.
 DIGGING FOR ANYTHING.
 YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT
 SHOULD DO?
 I'M SERIOUS.
 THE PRESIDENT SHOULD FLIP A
 DOUBLE BARREL MIDDLE FINGER TO
 DEMOCRATS AND SAY I'M A BUSINESS
 GUY.
 I GOT ELECTED PRESIDENT.
 I DON'T OWE YOU JACK SQUAT ON MY
 TAX RETURNS.
 WHY DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE ANY
 OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER TO SHOW A
 BUNCH OF POLITICAL HACKS WHO
 HAVE LIED ABOUT HIM FOR THREE
 YEARS NOW, FABRICATING ABSURD
 STORIES ABOUT COLLUSION,
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE,
 FELONIOUS MOPERY.
 THEY MADE THIS UP.
 NOW THEY WANT HIS TAX RETURNS
 AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO YEAH,
 NO PROBLEM, FELLOWS.
 YOU'RE SUCH BEACONS OF MORAL
 AUTHORITY.
 HE SHOULD TELL THEM TO POUND
 SAND.
 I WOULD.
 I WISH I HAD MORE TIME.
 NOT ONLY TRYING TO GET THE TAX
 RETURNS BUT HIS FINANCIAL
 RECORDS FOR HIS KIDS AND
 BUSINESSES.
 THERE'S NO FINANCIAL --
 THERE'S --
 JASON --
 GENTLEMEAVE TO MOVE ON.
 I WISH I COULD DO AN HOUR WITH
 YOU, CHRIS.
 I THINK YOU'RE SMART ON THIS
 STUFF BUT YOU'RE SO TOTALLY
 WRONG.
 I HAVE TO THANK BOTH OF YOU.
 IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS US TO
 KNOW HOW RICH HE IS, HE SHOULD
 SHOW US HIS TAX RETURNS.
 HE DOESN'T YOU THAT.
 HAVE TO GO.
 VERY DEEP IN THE MUELLER REPORT
 ARE A NUMBER OF PASSAGES THAT
 PAINT A STORY OF A OBAMA
 ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS TOTALLY
 UNPREPARED FOR THE THREAT OF
 RUSSIA.
 FOR MORE, WE GO TO CATHERINE
 HERRIDGE.
 CONGRESSMAN, THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL REPORT REVEALS A
 MULTIFCAMPAIGN.
 THE OPERATION WAS SO BOLD THE
 GROUND WORK WAS LAID IN 2014,
 TWO YEARS BEFORE A SINGLE BAT
 LOT WAS CAST.
 ACCORDING TO THE MUELLER REPORT,
 A RUSSIAN GROUP CALLED THE
 INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY USED
 SOCIAL MEDIA TO DRIVE A WEDGE
 BETWEEN AMERICANS AN AMPLIFY
 POLITICAL DIFFERENCES.
 RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
 WAS BEHIND HACKING OPERATIONS
 TARGETING THE DNC AND CLINTON
 CAMPAIGN E-MAILS.
 THE FINAL ELEMENT TARGETING THE
 TRUMP TEAM.
 THE RUSSIAN OPERATION HAD THE
 ABILITY TO REACH MILLIONS OF
 AMERICANS THROUGH TWITTER,
 FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM AND OTHER
 OUTLETS.
 ALTHOUGH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT
 PERCEIVED IT WOULD BENEFIT FROM
 A TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND WORKED TO
 SECURE THAT OUTCOME, THE
 INVESTIGATION DID NOT ESTABLISH
 THE MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP
  CONSPIRED OR
 COORDINATED WITH THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT.
 MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE
 ELECTION, A FORMER REPUBLICAN
 LAWMAKER SAID PRESIDENT OBAMA
 DROPPED THE BALL AND HE'S
 CONCERNED THERE'S NO DETAILED
 PLAN TO PREVENT A REPEAT IN

 THESE CANDIDATES, ALL
 CANDIDATES QUALIFIED FOR
 PRESIDENT, ARE GIVING CLASSIFIED
 BRIEFINGS.
 THEY'RE BROUGHT UP TO SPEED ON
 OUR RELATIONSHIP GLOBALLY.
 THEY ALSO NEED TO KNOW IF
 THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT
 THERE'S A TRAITOR OR AN ATTEMPT
 TO BETRAY THEM IN THEIR MIDSTS.
 THE FBI'S COUNTER
 INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION THAT
 LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS OPENED IN
 LATE JULY 207 BY PETER STRZOK
 WHO WAS LATER REMOVED OVER HIS
 ANTI-TRUMP TEXTS.
 IF THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE AND
 SECURE A WARRANT IN 2016 FOR
 CARTER PAGE, IT NEVER PANNED OUT
 WITH SPECIAL COUNSEL
 INVESTIGATORS FINDING NO
 CONSPIRACY WITH RUSSIA.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM
 BARR IS REVIEWING THE GENESIS OF
 THE RUSSIA PROBE TO MAKE SURE
 THERE WAS NO UNAUTHORIZED
 SURVEILLANCE.
 MR. BARR DID NOT OFFER MORE
 SPECIFICS, FOX NEWS UNDERSTANDS
 ITS CONSIDERED A VERY SERIOUS
 MATTER.
 CONGRESSMAN?
 CATHERINE, THANK YOU.
 HERE WITH US, JOHN RATCLIFFE,
 MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY■C
 COMMITTEE.
 HE IS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS.
 CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO PICK UP
 ON WHAT CATHERINE WAS TALKING ■.
 SUPPOSEDLY THE DEPARTMENT OF
 JUSTICE HAD PROBABLE ■C■C■C■C■CC
 RIGHT?
 TO GO AND GET THIS WARRANT TO
 SPY ON SOMEBODY IN THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN.
 WE GET TO COLLUSION AND THEY
 FIND NOTHING.
 WHAT IS DISCONNECT HERE?
 REMEMBER WHAT BILL BARR SAID
 LAST WEEK?
 THAT THE TRUMP -THE OBAMA
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS SPYING ON
 THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
 THE QUESTION IS, WAS THERE A
 PROPER PREDICATE?
 WAS THERE PROBABLE CAUSE TO
 BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A
 CONSPIRACY OR COLLUSION BETWEEN
 THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN?
 SO THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT HAS
 TO BE ANSWERED.
 TO BE FAIR, JUST BECAUSE BOB
 MUELLER FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO
 EVIDENCE OF A CONSPIRACY OR NO
 EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION, DOESN'T
 MEAN THAT THERE COULDN'T BE
 PROBABLE CAUSE TO LOOK FOR.
 IN OTHER WORDS, A GOOD REASON TO
 BELIEVE IT EXISTED.
 HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
 AS YOU KNOW, TREY GOWDY AND I
 ARE THE ONLY TWO REPUBLICANS
 THAT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE
 THAT PROBABLE CAUSE EVIDENCE, TO
 SEE ALL OF THOSE FISA
 APPLICATIONS IN UNREDACTED FORM.
 AND THEY CENTERED AROUND
 SOMETHING CALLED THE STEELE
 DOSSIER, WHICH WAS ENTIRELY
 FALSE AND FAKE.
 NOW BOB MUELLER SAYS IT WAS
 FALSE AND FAKE.
 REMEMBER, THE STEELE DOSSIER
 SAID THAT CARTER PAGE WAS AT THE
 CENTER OF A WELL-DEVELOPED
 CONSPIRACY BETWEEN THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT.
 CARTER PAGE WASN'T CHARGED, HE
 WAS NEVER GOING TO BE CHARGED.
 THE IDEA THAT HE WAS A RUSSIAN
 AGENT IS A JOKE SO THE FOLKS
 AT -SALLY YATES AND THOSE THAT
 VERIFIED THIS, THEY HAVE
 EXPLAINING TO DO.
 WHAT ABOUT THE FISA COURT
 ITSELF?
 IS THEISA COURT BLAME
 WERE THEY JUST SNOOKERED?
 NO.
 NOT NECESSARILY, JASON.
 REMEMBER WHAT THEY RECEIVED WHEN
 THEY WERE ASKED TO GRANT A
 WARRANT TO SPY ON CARTER PAGE.
 THE FIRST THING THEY SEE IN BIG
 BOLD LETTERS ARE VERIFIED
 APPLICATION, ALL CAPITOLS.
 SO JAMES COMEY AND SALLY YATES
 SIGNED OFF ON THOSE ARE
 VERIFYING TO THE COURT WHAT IS
 IN THERE.
 THEY'RE VERIFYING THAT
 CHRISTOPHER STEELE WAS A
 CREDIBLE SOURCE.
 THEY'RE VERIFYING THAT THE
 STEELE DOSSIER HAD BEEN

 CORROBORATED.
 NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE.
 SO THE FOLKS THAT SIGNED OFF ON,
 OURT ONLY KNOW WHAT
 THEY'RE TOLD.
 THEY WEREN'T TOLD THAT
 CHRISTOPHER STEELE WAS OUT TO
 THEY WEREN'T TOLD THAT THE
 STEELE DOSSIER WAS PAID FOR BY
 HILLARY CLINTON.
 SO THE COURT WAS AT THE MERCY OF
 THE PEOPLE THAT VERIFIED THIS
 INFORMATION.
 THAT'S WHAT BILL BARR WILL LOOK
 AT.
 THAT'S WHAT HE'S PROMISED TO
 LOOK AT■C■C■C AND WHAT NEED HIM
 LOOK AT.
  CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU.
 YOU■C■C■CCUTED TERRORISM CASES
 AND ONE OF TWO PEOPLE TO HAVE
 ACTUALLY SEEN THAT DOCUMENT.
 I NEVER HEARD THAT, THAT IT WAS
 SAID AT THE■C■C■C TOP THAT IT W
 VEN BOLD CAPITOL LETTERS
 THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO
 KNOW.
 THANK YOU.
 ALSO FROM TEXAS, THE TEXAS
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DAN PATRICK.
 SAYS SITTING HER WITH US.
 THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
 THANK YOU.
 AMAZING THINGS HAPPENING IN
 TEXAS.
 TEXAS IS A RED STATE.
 AND WE'RE GOING TO STATE RED
 AND THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO
 KICK THEIR BUTT NO MATTER WHAT
 TEAM THEY LINE UP.
 COUPLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
 THE LAST ELECTION WAS REAL.
 BETO O'ROURKE RAISED $80
 MILLION.
 CRAZY.
 DID 80 MILLION.
 AND SOME THINGS HAPPENED THAT
 WOULD NOT NORMALLY HAPPEN.
 THIS ELECTION WILL BE DIFFERENT.
 FIRST OF ALL, WHEN PRESIDENT
 TRUMP RAN, PEOPLE PUT THEIR
 HOPES ON HIM.
 THEY DIDN'T KNOW HIM WELL.
 THEY SAID WE NEED THIS GUY.
 HERE'S SANITY IN A WORLD OF
 INSANITY.
 NOW HE'S DELIVERED.
 WHEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU SAY
 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND DO
 WHAT YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO
 THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN DONE.
 WHERE HE'S STYMIED, IT'S NOT HIS
 DOING AND HE WILL GET IT DONE.
 HE'S A TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE
 FAMILY.
 PEOPLE HAVE YOUR BACK WHEN YOU
 BECOME A TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE
 FAMILY.
 SO IN TEXAS, THE LEFTIST
 DEMOCRATS, THE BILLIONAIRES AND
 MILLIONAIRES ARE GOING TO POUR
 MONEY TO TEXAS THINKING THEY
 HAVE A SHOT.
 THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO POUR
 MONEY.
 SENATOR CORNYN IS ON THE TICKET.
 I READ THERE'S SOMETHING
 LIKE -SINCE THE MID-TERM,
 WHICH WASN'T TOO LONG AGO,
 THERE'S LIKE 400,000 --
 NEWLY REGISTERED VOTERS.
 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
 WE'RE A GROWING STATE.
 YOU'RE NOT GROWING THAT FAST.
 ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE A DAY.
 IT'S FAST.
 OUR REGISTRATION GOES UP 8 TO
 10% EVERY ELECTION.
 WE'RE GOING TO REGISTER A LOT OF
 REPUBLICANS.
 NO MATTER WHO THE DEMOCRATS
 HAVE, LET'S SAY IT'S BERNIE.
 WE DO A LOT OF HUNTING IN TEXAS.
 THAT TICKET WON'T HUNT, THIS
 COULD BE A McGOVERN TYPE OF
 YEAR.
 TRIP WILL DO BETTER IN MICHIGAN.
 HE WON BY NINE.
 IT WILL TAKE MONEY AND TIME BUT
 TEXANS WILL TURN OUT.
 WE TURNED OUT DESPITE THE FACT
 THAT BETO MADE A CHARGE.
 I RECEIVED 1.5 MILLION MORE
 VOTERS.
 SO REPUBLICANS WILL BE THERE.
 THE MARGIN WERE DIFFERENT.
 BUT THIS ELECTION -THE WORLD
 IS CRAZY.
 I HAVE ABOUT 30 SECONDS LEFT.
 TELL ME ABOUT THE POLITICS AT
 THE BORDER.
 HOW IS THAT PLAYING?
 THE DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN
 BORDERS.
 THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE
 LIVES OF BABIES ON BOTCHED
 ABORTIONS.
 THEY WANT A WEAKENED MILITARY.
 TEXANS LIKE AMERICANS ARE SMART.
 THEY HAVE COMMON SENSE.
 THEY KNOW ALL OF THE POLICIES
 ARE FAILED POLICIES.
 THE BORDER IS IMPORTANT IN
 TEXAS.
 WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED A TOTAL
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE CROSSING THE
 TEXAS ILLEGALLY THAN ALL OF LAST
 YEAR.
 AND YOU HAVE A VOTER
 REGISTRATION ISSUE WE HAVE TO
 DEAL WITH AS WELL.
 TRUMP WILL WIN TEXAS.
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HIS BACK AND
 HE WILL HAVE A HUGE VICTORY AND
 PUT AN END TO SOCIALISM.
 YOU HAVE TO WIN TEXAS TO WIN
 THE PRESIDENCY.
 COUNT ON IT.
 THIS YEAR, AN ATTACK ON
 CHRISTIANS.
 SO WHY CAN'T BARACK OBAMA AND
 HILLARY CLINTON JUST SAY AS
 MUCH?
 VICTOR DAVIS HANSON HAS SOME
 THOUGHTS.
 LATER, HE CLAIMS HE WAS KICKED
 OUT OF THE CONNECTICUT HIGH
 SCHOOL FOR BEING A CONSERVATIVE
 AND HE HAS RECORDINGS TO BACK IT
 UP.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THE
 ■■■e8■■
         Some people say        "dress your age."
        That's ridiculous.
       I dress how I feel.
    Yesterday I felt bold with        boundless energy.
   This morning I woke up calm         and unbreakable.
       Tomorrow? Who knows.
     Age is just an illusion.
     How you show up for the    world, that's what's real.
        What's your idea?
     I put it out there with        a GoDaddy website.
     Make the world you want.
 EXPLOSIONS ACROSS THE WORLD ARE MAKING SUNDAY TOUGH.
 IT'S ON PEOPLE'S MIND AS THEY
 GO TO CHURCH.
 MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE WERE
 KILLED AND 800 INJURED IN
 SRI LANKA.
 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE
 TO THINK ABOUT IN A RELIGIOUS
 HOUSE.
 IT'S SOMETHING TO BE
 CONCERNED ABOUT.
 THERE'S A RISING OF THE REST
 COLLECTION.
 EVERYBODY SHOULD DO THAT SAFELY.
 IT'S A HARD STORY.
 HUNDREDS WERE KILLED AND
 HUNDREDS MORE WERE INJURED AFTER
 A WELL-COORDINATED TERROR ATTACK
 RICH THROUGH CHURCHES IN
 SRI LANKA.
 A LITTLE TERROR GROUP TARGETED
 THESE FOLKS BECAUSE OF THEIR
 FAITH.
 A TWEET SEND OUT BY BARACK OBAMA
 AND HILLARY CLINTON, THEY BOTH
 USED THE PHRASE EASTER
 WORSHIPPERS.
 MANY FOUND IT AS A WAY TO GLOSS
 OVER THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN
 MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS .
 SO WHAT DOES VICTOR DAVIS HANSON
 THINK?
 HE'S A FELLOW OF THE HOOVER
 INSTITUTION.
 SIR, I APPRECIATE YOU JOI■k■k■k
 A LOT OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS.
 REPRESENTATIVE KILDE, THE
 GOVERNOR OF COLORADO.
 THEY ALL TALK ABOUT EASTE
 WORSHIPPERS.
 WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?
 WE SAW THE SAME THING WITH
 THE NOTRE DAME TRAGEDY.
 IT WAS A TOURIST DESTINATION
 RATHER THAN A CHURCH.
 FOR THE LIBERAL MODERN
 PROGRESSIVE MIND AND THE
 CONSTITUENCIES THAT THEY
 REPRESENT, THIS IS PART OF
 WESTERN CIVILIZATION.
 IT'S IRONIC, JASON.
 THE MAJORITY NOW FOR THE FIRST
 TIME REALLY IN THE LAST TWO
 DECADES OF THE WORLD'S 2.5
 BILLION CHRISTIANS ARE NOT IN
 EUROPE OR THE UNITED STATES.
 PEOPLE MUCH POORER THAN WE ARE
 IN AFRICA OR ASIA AND LATIN
 AMERICA AND SOUTH AMERICAN, THEY
 BELIEVE THEY HAVE HOPE IN
 CONDITIONS FAR LESS FREE THAN
 OUR OWN.
 WE HAVE FREEDOM AND AFFLUENCE
 AND WE ABUSE THAT AND LOSE OUR
 FAITH.
 Jason: I APPRECIATE YOUR
 TS ON THAT. ALSO W GET YOUR THO
 ON THIS.
 I WANT TO PITH YOU --■■
 PLAYED T■■EO FOR
 IT'S AN NBC NEWS REPORTER
 CONFRONTING MR. MUELLER OUTSIDE
 OF A CHURCH ON EASTER.
 WATCH THIS.
 WE WAITED FOR HIM EASTER
 SERVICES, TRIED TO AS
 RESPECTFUL AS POSSIBLE.
 YOU TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS,
 SIR?
 NOqg■mñnMMENT.
 YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
 NO COMMENT.
 WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE A
 RECOMMENDATION TO CONGRESS?
 IT'S ACCURATE TO CHARACTERIZE
 DIRECTOR MUELLER AS BEING TIGHT
 LIPPED IN RESPONSE TO MY
 QUESTIONS.
 Jason: THEY'RE LAUGHING AT
 THE END OF THAT.
 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
 YEAH.
 AGAIN FOR THE MEDIA AND THE
 PROGRESSIVE SWATH OF THE
 POPULATION, AN EASTER SERVICE IS
 NOT A SAFE SPACE.
 THE SAFE SPACE IS A RACIALLY
 SEGREGATED PLACE ON CAMPUS.
 THE OTHER ASPECT, MUELLER WAS A
 GOD OF DEITY UNTIL HE DIDN'T
 BRING BACK A VERDICT OF
 COLLUSION.
 SO IN THIS NEWS CYCLE THAT THE
 PROGRESSIVES FOLLOW, HE'S NO
 LONGER A SAINT.
 Jason: VERY TRUE.
 I ALSO WANT YOUR -I READ THIS
 PIECE THAT YOU WROTE IN NATIONA■
 YOU TALK ABOUT THE EFFORTS T■k■
 ■O TO THE VIEWERS, WHAT
 YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THIS WAY O■
 DEMONIZING ATTORNEY GENERAL
 BARR.
 I THINK THEY'RE VERY AFRAID
 OF WILLIAM BARR.
 THEY DON'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL
 FROM.
 WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN OF HIM, HE'S
 FOLLOWED THE LAW TO THE LETTER
 NO MATTER THE PUBLIC PRESSURE ON
 THE PARTISANSHIP.
 HE GIVE A SYNOPSIS OF THE
 MUELLER REPORT ANDWERE
 FURIOUS BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT.
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE ONLY THING
 THAT WILL STOP THIS HYSTERIA
 FROM CYCLES OF LOGAN ACT CLAUSE,
 25th AMENDMENT, MUELLER IS GOING
 TO WEAR THE REAL CULPABILITY IS.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET REFERRALS
 FROM THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE
 AND THERE IS REAL LEGAL EXPOSURE
 THERE.
 A FISA COURT WAS DECEIVED.
 RUSSIAN NATIONALS GAVE
 INFORMATION TO A PAID EMPLOYEE
 OF GPS WHO WAS IN TURN PAID BY
 HILLARY CLINTON.
 WE KNOW THAT JAMES COMEY LEAKED
 A CLASSIFIED MEMO.
 WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE,
 ANDREW McCABE IN PARTICULAR,
 PROBABLY JAMES COMEY AS WELL,
 LIED TO F INVESTIGATORS OR
 LIED UNDER OATH TO CONGRESS.
 BAR IS NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON IN
 THE CASE OF CLAPPER AND■m BR
 THAT'S OKAY.
 HE'S A PROFESSIONAL.
 HE UNDERSTANDS THERE'S NOTHING
 THAT T LEFT CAN DO THAT WILL
 SWAY HIM IF THERE'S CULPABILITY.
 IT'S A VERY SCARY THOUGHT.
 IF THERE IS CULPABILITY.S■O■O■O
 Jason: IT'S A GREAT PIECE.
 I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK IT
 UP.
 THANKS, VICTOR.
 MEXICAN TROOPS PULLING THEIR
 WEAPONS ON U.S. SOLDIERS ON OUR
 SIDE OF THE BORDER.

 Jason: A SHOCKING STORY COMING FROM THE BORDER OF MEXICO
 AS MEXICAN TROOPS DISARMING AN
 AMERICAN SOLDIER WHILE ON THE
 UNITED STATES SIDE OF THE
 BORDER.
 TRACE GALLAGHER IS IN OUR WEST
 COAST NEWSROOM WITH THE LATEST.
 TRACE?
 JASON, THIS HAPPENED NINE
 DAYS AGO IN EL PASO COUNTY.
 TWO U.S. SOLDIERS WERE SWIFTLY
 APPROACH AT GUN POINT BY FIVE OR
 SIX MEMBERS OF THE MEXICAN
 MILITARY WHO WERE APPARENTLY
 CARRYING ASSAULT RIFLES.
 THE U.S. SOLDIERS SAY■a■■ENED S
 HAVE TIME TO ACTIVATE THEIR GPS
 TRACKING DEVICE, WHICH ALSO
 DOUBLES AS AN EMERGENCY BEACON
 TO NOTIFIED 911.
 THE MEXICAN■÷■÷■@■@■@Y M■EMBERS
 ORDERED THE SOLDIERS OUT O■7■■
 CAR, TOLD THEM TO MOVE TO THE
 FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND REMOVED
 ONE OF THE SOLDIER'S SERVICE
 WEAPONS PLACING IT INSIDE THE
 U.S. GOVERNMENT VEHICLE.
 THE SOLDIER SAYS HE GAVE UP HIS■
 WEAPON TO■4■÷
 SITUATIONHERE WAS CERTAIN
 BECAUSE THE U.S. SOLDIERS
 COULDN'T IDENTIFY ANY SEALS OR
 SYMBOLS ON THE MEXICAN MILITARY
 FORTUNATELY ONE OF T@p
 @p@pKE A LITTLE SPANISH
 AND WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE
 SITUATION.
 ONE SOLDIER SAYS HE ALSO HEARD
 SOMEONE SOUTH OF THE BORDER YELL
 LET'S GO AND THEIR LEFT.
 THE ENTIRE ENCOUNTER LASTED LESS
 THAN 30 MINUTES.
 TURNS OUT, THE U.S. SOLDIERS
 WERE SOUTH OF THE BORDER FENCE,
 BUT NORTH OF THE RIO GRANDE.
 MEANING THEY WERE IN THE UNITED
 STATES.
 AUTHORITIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
 BECAUSE THE AREA IS DRIED OUT
 AND FILLED WITH BRUSH, IT'S
 OFTEN DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT
 SORT OF THE BORDER YOU'RE ON.
 WHEN U.S. SOLDIERS GET IN THEIR
 VEHICLE, THEY CONTACTED CUSTOMS
 AND BORDER PROTECTION WHO
 QUICKLY RERESPONDED.
 WE'RE TOLD THE U.S. SOLDIERSçI■I
 FOLLOWED ALL PROCEDURES AND
 PROTOCOLS.
 JASON?
 THANK YOU.
 JOINING ME NOW WITH REACTION IS
 MARK MORGAN, A FORMER BORDER
 PATROL CHIEF UNDER OBAMA AND TOM
 HOLMAN.
 MARK, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.
 THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS MORE OFTEN
 THAN WE WOULD KNOW, RIGHT?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 THIS IS A ONE-TIME EVENT.
 THIS ILLUSTRATES HOW DIFFICULT
 IT IS TO PATROL THE SOUTHWEST
 BORDER.
 I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE
 SITUATION.
 SOMETIMES MEXICAN OFFICIALS ARE
 WORKING FOR THE CARTELS.
 IF YOU LISTEN TO TRACE'S
 EXPLANATION IS, I'M NOT SURE
 100% THE ACTUAL MEXICAN
 GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
 THAT IS PART OF THE POINT
 HERE, RIGHT?
 IT'S NOT AS IF THE UNITED STATES
 IS TRYING TO BREAK IN TO MEXICO.
 WHY WOULD THEY HAVE TROOPS RIGHT
 UP ON OUR BORDER.
 RIGHT.
 FROM MY EXPERIENCE, I WOULD
 SUGGEST THEY WERE THERE POSSIBLY
 SUPPORTING THE MEXICAN CARTELS.
 THAT IS A LARGE CALL ASSUMPTION.
 IT'S NOT FAR OFF PACE.
 YOU HAD THIS EXPERIENCE, TOM.
 YOU DETAINED MEXICAN OFFICIALS
 ON OUR SIDE.
 YEAH, WHEN THE STORY BROKE, I
 REMEMBER 30 YEARS AGO, AS A
 YOUNG AGENT, WE GOT A CALL
 MEXICAN MILITARY ON A RANCH.
 THE RANCHER CALLED US.
 FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
 WE SHOWED UP, SEVERAL OTHER
 AGENTS.
 WE FOUND HIM.
 WE HANDLED IT DIFFERENTLY.
 WE DISARMED HIM AND ARRESTED
 HIM.
 WE TURNED HIM OVER TO THE
 COMMANDER AND GAVE HIM THE
 AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
 MARK IS RIGHT.
 WHEN YOU GET A CALL LIKE THAT,
 YOU DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S
 MEXICANS IN FATIGUES 0, MILITARY
 LOST IN A TRAINING EXERCISE OR
 DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE WORKING IN
 A SECURITY DETAIL.
 IT'S A SCARY SITUATION AND IT
 WASN'T UNTIL AFTER THIS
 SITUATION HAPPENED, IT'S LIKE
 WOW THAT COULD HAVE WENT BAT.
 CARRYING A SIX-SHOT RUGER.
 IT HAPPENS MORE TIMES THAN YOU
 CAN GUESS.
 NOW, PART OF THE ISSUE HERE,
 MARK, THAT THERE EVIDENTLY
 WASN'T A WALL OR FENCE.
 IF YOU CAN'T DELINEATE WHERE THE
 BORDER IS, IT SOUNDS AS IF
 THERE'S CONFUSION.
 BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WALL,
 RIGHT?
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 THIS IS ANOTHER -IT'S NOT
 MANUFACTURED, THIS IS ANOTHER
 EXAMPLE THAT 60% OF THE BORDER
 IS WIDE OPEN.
 MEANING IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
 OF THE MULTILAYER APPROACH.
 IF YOU HAD THAT AT THE RIGHT
 LEVELS, I THINK THIS ISSUE
 WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
 THE NUMBER OF APPREHENSIONS,
 FOX PLAYING THIS STORY EARLIER,
 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
 164,000 APPREHENSIONS IN THE
 FIRST SEVEN MONTHS.
 THAT'S MORE THAN ALL OF LAST
 YEAR.
 NOW, IT'S DONE ON A FISCAL
 CALENDAR.
 WE'RE STILL ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS
 IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR.
 WE'RE TO THE FISCAL YEAR.
 THE TRAJECTORY HERE, THE NUMBERS
 ARE OVERWHELMING.
 THERE'S GOING TO BE OVER A
 MILLION.
 I'LL PUT IT IN THIS CONTEXT.
 I'VE DONE THIS 34 YEARS.
 THIS IS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN
 IT.
 HAVE WE ARRESTED --
 Jason: WHY?
 WE ARRESTED MORE THAN A
 MILLION A COUPLE DECADES AGO.
 95% WERE MEXICAN NATIONALS.
 THEY WERE REMOVED AND REENTERED.
 I ARRESTED THE SAME ONES THREE
 OR FOUR TIMES IN A SHIFT.
 THEY WERE QUICKLY REMOVED, THIS
 MILLION PEOPLE COMING NOW,
 THEY'RE NOT LEAVING.
 THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
 LOOP HOLES AND WILL BE HERE FOR
 YEARS.
 EVEN IF THEY DO SHOW UP IN
 COURT, 90% WILL LOSE.
 THEY'RE NOT LEAVING.
 I WENT TO THE DETENTION
 FACILITY IN ARIZONA.
 THERE WERE PEOPLE FROM 150
 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THERE.
 DON'T JUST THINK THIS IS MEXICAN
 OR HONDURANS.
 THERE'S PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE
 WORLD.
 THEY KNOW THIS IS HOW YOU GET IN
 THE UNITED STATES.
 TOM IS RIGHT.
 THAT'S PART OF THE FALSE
 NARRATIVE THAT YOU HEAR WELL,
 BACK IN THE 2000s, NUMBERS WERE
 HIGHER.
 IT'S FALSE.
 IT'S TIME TO DESCRIBE IT.
 WE REMOVED 90% BACK THEN.
 THIS YEAR WITH THE MILLION
 ANTICIPATED BECAUSE OF THE
 BROKEN LAWS, WE'LL ALLOW 650,000
 TO 700,000 INTO OUR COUNTRY.
 SO IT'S A COMPLETE FALSE
 NARRATIVE.
 THAT'S WHY OUR SYSTEM IS
 OVERWHELMED.
 Jason: WE CAN KEEP SAYING
 CONGRESS, CONGRESS, CONGRESS,
 BUT JUST TRYING TO ENFORCE THE
 CURRENT LAW, I MEAN, IS A VERY
 DIFFICULT THING.
 CAN'T THANK THE MEN AND WOMEN
 DOING THE JOB THAT YOU HAVE DONE
 IN THE PAST.
 WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE
 AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
 TODAY.
 MEXICAN TROOPS ON OUR SIDE OF
 THE BORDER DISARMING OUR ARMY?
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 2020 CANDIDATES HAVE MADE THE
 ISSUE OF REPARATIONS PART OF
 THEIR PLATFORMS.
 NOW A SERIOUS EFFORT IS -BY
 HOUSE DEMOCRATS COULD MAKE THIS
 A LEGISLATIVE REALITY.
 AND WHY IS ONE COLLEGE NEWSPAPER
 ENDORSING THE IDEA OF SEGREGATED
 HOUSING?
 SERIOUSLY?
 THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.

 HAS PROPOSED A COMMISSION TO STUDY REPARATIONS.
 IF THAT PASSES AND YOU ARE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
 WOULD YOU SIGN THAT BILL?
 YES.
  WHEN I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, I
 WILL SIGN THAT BILL.
 YES, I WOULD.
 I ALREADY SUPPORT THAT BILL.
 JHILE REPARATIONS
 DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF
 BARACK OBAMA, IT'S A LITMUS TEST
 FOR THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES.
 NOW WITH MANY SUPPORTING IT, THE
 DEBATE HAS NEW MOMENTUM IN
 CONGRESS.
 SHEILA JACKSON LEE PO
 CREATE A COMMISSION TO STUDY THE
 IMPACT OF SLAVERY AND
 REPARATIONS.
 JOINING ME, DON JOINS, ATTORNEY
 AND FORMER GEORGIA STATE
 REPRESENTATIVE.
 THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
 I WANT TO GO TO YOU FIRST.
 WHY IS THIS AN IDEA?
 HERE WE ARE IN 2019.
 WHY IS THIS AN IDEA THAT IS
 SUDDENLY CATCHING ON?
 IS IT JUST ELECTION YEAR
 POLITICS OR SOMETHING THAT IS
 REAL?
 YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN AN
 ISSUE THAT HAS COME UP IN
 AMERICAN POLITICS SINCE THE 70s.
 NOW WE HAVE CANDIDATES THAT ARE
 REALLY WILLING TO OPEN UP AND
 SPEAK ABOUT IT AND A YOUNG
 PROGRESSIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE IN
 COLLEGES THAT ARE LOOKING
 FORWARD TO THE REPARATIONS
 ISSUE.
 LISTEN, ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
 IS STUDYING AN ISSUE WHERE
 AMERICAN HAS GIVEN REPARATIONS
 AFTER WORLD WAR ONE, FOR
 INTERNMENT CAMPS, ALL KINDS OF
 SITUATIONS.
 SO WHY NOT DISCUSSING THE IDEA
 FOR ONE OF THE MOST HORRIBLE
 PORTIONS OF AMERICAN HISTORY,
 SLAVERY.
 LET'S DISCUSS IT.
 Jason: HORACE, YOUR THOUGHTS?
 THIS IS A SCHOOL, A RUSE.
 THE DEMOCRATS AND PROGRESSIVES
 HAVE NO ACTUAL AGENDA TO OFFER
 BLACK AMERICANS OR FOR THAT
 MATTER ANY WORKING AMERICANS IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 FDR, FAMOUSLY SAID, ALL WE HAVE
 TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF.
 PROGRESSIVES TODAY, ALL THEY
 HAVE TO OFFER IS FEAR.
 THEY GO WITH DIVISION, THEY GO
 WITH THE EFFORT TO SEPARATE US.
 THERE IS NO SCENARIO WHERE
 CHECKS ARE COMING OUT TO PEOPLE.
 THIS IS JUST A SUBSTITUTE FOR
 HAVING TO GO FORWARD WITH A REAL
 ALTERNATIVE TO THE BOOMING JOB
 CREATION PLAN THAT PRESIDENT
 TRUMP HAS PRESENTED.
 Jason: AND PRESIDENT OBAMA
 OBAMA DIDN'T SUPPORT IT.
 BERNIE SANDERS DOESN'T SUPPORT
 IT.
 AND WHY IS IT COMING UP NOW?
 DOES IT ALWAYS COME UP JUST
 BEFORE AN ELECTION?
 WELL, AS YOU MENTIONED,
 BARACK OBAMA DIDN'T SUPPORT IT.
 IT DID NOT COME UP BEFORE EVERY
 ELECTION.
 BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA WAS BLACK
 DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE HAS TO
 SUPPORT EVERY ISSUE THAT OTHER
 BLACK PEOPLE SUPPORT.
 I'M NOT SURE WHY MR. COOPER IS
 AFRAID OF REPARATIONS.
 IT'S A SCAM.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ONLY
 BELIEVE IT HAS TO BE CHECKSp@p@@
 IT'S Ap@p@ SCAM.
 THERE'S NO --
 Jason: HOLD ON.
 THERE'S NO LIVING FORMER
 SLAVES.
 Jason: I HAVE TO TURN TO
 SOMETHING ELSE THAT GETS UNDER
 MY SKIN.
 IT'S HAPPENING IN WILLIAMS
 COLLAGE IN MASSACHUSETTS.
 THE SCHOOL'S EDITORIAL BOARD HAS
 ENDORSED RACIAL SEGREGATED
 HOUSING ON CAMPUS, THIS IS
 HAPPENING.
 THE WILLIAMS RECORD WRITES THAT
 THE COLLEGE A PREDOMINANTLY
 WHITE INSTITUTION AND STUDENTS
 OF COLOR FEEL TOKENIZED.
 IT WILL HAVE A MORE SAFE
 COMMUNITY FOR MINORITIZED
 STUDENTS.
 AND THIS IS HAPPENING HERE IN
 D.C., TOO.
 GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY.
 IF THEY HAD DONE THIS IN IDAHO
 OR UTAH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
 NOW IT'S HAPPENING IN
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS
 ARE ON THIS.
 IS THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?
 SEGREGATED HOUSING?
 LET'S BE CLEAR.
 THE AFFINITY HOUSING THAT
 THEY'RE REQUESTING IS NOT ONLY
 RACE BASED, IT'S BASED ON
 GENDER.
 WHY IS IT THAT THESE YOUNG
 ADULTS CAN NOT HAVE A DISCUSSION
 ABOUT WHAT MAKES THEM
 COMFORTABLE IN THEIR SCHOOL?
 I'M A PROUD GRADUATE OF A
 HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND
 UNIVERSITY.
 ONE OF THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ONLY
 AFRICAN AMERICANS GO TO.
 I SEE NOTHING WRONG JUST LIKE
 REPARATIONS WITH EXPLORING THE
 IDEAS OF WHAT WORKS FOR THEM.
 LISTEN, AMERICA --
 MOVING THEp@p@p@p@p@p@p@p@ S
 SCHOOLS -I HAVE 20 SECONDS
 LEFT.
 I LOVE THIS.
 WE WANT TO WRAP DISCRIMINATION
 BIGOTRY IN THE RUBRIC OF THE
 FIRST AMENDMENT.
 BROWN V. BOARD RULED SEGREGATION
 IS INHERENTLY UNEQUAL.
 IT'S 2019.
 WE NEED TO MOVE ON PASSED ALL OF
 THESE THINGS, PUT UP A REAL
 AGENDA.
 IF YOU WANT TO COMPETE WITH WHAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP DOING, PUT UP
 A REAL AGENDA.
 Jason: SEGREGATING SCHOOLS
 AND PUTTING -I HOPE WE
 CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE
 I THINK IT'S WORTH HAVING.
 I DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO
 HAVE IT IN THE YEAR 2019.
 THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT.
 WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.
 A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SAYS HE
 WAS EXPELLED FOR BEING A
 CONSERVATIVE.
 HE HAS AUDIO CLIPS TO BACK IT
 UP.
 THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.
                       ■■■■■----Q
 Oh, sir. That was my grandma's.
 Don't worry, ma'am. All of your stuff is in OK hands.
             Just OK?
  They don't give two and a half  stars to just anybody.
           Here you go.
           What's this?
         It's your piano.
       Hold this for a sec!
      We don't have a piano.
               No.
      But the neighbors do.

 16-YEAR-OLD MICHAEL MANCINI SAID HE WAS EXPELLED FROM HIGH
 SCHOOL FOR EXPRESSING HIS
 CONSERVATIVE VIEWS.
 IT STARTED BECAUSE HE DISAGREED
 WITH WHAT IS SHAKESPEARE
 PORTRAYING GENDERISM IN A
 POSITIVE LIGHT.
 THIS IS THE SECRETLY RECORDED
 AUDIO HE TOOK WHEN SPEAKING WITH
 THE HEAD OF THE DISCIPLINARY
 COMMITTEE.
 WHEN YOU SPEAK YOUR MIND AND
 YOU ARE OFFENDING PEOPLE IN THE
 ROOM, THAT CAN BE SEEN AS PART
 OF HARASSMENT.
 I HAD THESE TWO GIRLS
 SCREAMING IN MY FACE.
 THAT MADE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.
 HARASSING ME.
 YOU MAKE COMMENTS IN CLASS
 AND MAKE THOSE PEOPLE FEEL
 UNCOMFORTABLE.
 THE INITIAL BURDEN IS ON YOU.
 Jason: WE REACHED OUT TO THE
 SCHOOL AND HAVE NOT HEARD BACK.
 JOINING ME NOW IS MICHAEL
 MANCINI AND HE'S FATHER, TED.
 THANKS FOR JOINING US HERE.
 YOU SAID, MICHAEL -I'M SORRY
 YOU'RE HAVING TO GO THROUGH
 THIS.
 BUT WHAT IS IT THAT WAS SO
 DISAGREEABLE AT THAT SCHOOL?
 WELL, I SAID THAT IT WAS
 HISTORICALLY INACCURATE FOR
 SHAKESPEARE TO PROMOTE
 TRANSGENDERISM IN A POSITIVE
 LIGHT.
 WE TALKED ABOUT THE BOCK WRITTEN
 IN 1601 TO 1602.
 THEY WOULD HAVE NOT NORMALIZED
 THAT OR PORTRAYED THAT IN A
 POSITIVE LIGHT.
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT
 MENTAL INSANITY.
 Jason: TED, YOU HEARD THERE
 WAS A PROBLEM AND THEN YOUR SON
 IS BEING EXPELLED.
 AS YOU DOVE IN, WHAT DID YOU
 FIND?
 I FOUND THAT IT'S REALLY
 HEAVY LIBERAL BIAS.
 WITH THE TAPES THAT YOU JUST
 PLAYED, IF YOU DO ON THE
 WEBSITE,
 THEREALCHESHSHIREACADEMY.
 COMP , YOU CAN SEE IT ALL.
 IF SOMEONE IS OFFENDED, YOU'RE
 ON THE HOOK FOR THAT AND IT'S
 YOU'RE FAULT IF THEY ATTACK YOU.
 Jason: MICHAEL, WAS THERE A
 FIGHT?
 PUSHING, SHOVING?
 NO PUSHING OR SHOVING.
 JUST YELLING.
 Jason: AND YOU SAID THERE
 WERE TWO GIRLS THAT YELLED AT
 YOU AND TRYING TO INTIMIDATE
 YOU.
 DID ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THEM?
 I WAS NOT TOLD.
 I WAS TOLD THEY WERE PUNISHED.
 I WAS NEVER TOLD EXACTLY WHAT.
 THEY WEREN'T GIVEN A
 DISCIPLINARY HEARING LIKE
 MICHAEL WAS.
 NOT EVEN CLOSE.
 SO WHAT ARE THE LESSONS
 YOU'RE LEARNING HERE?
 YOU WERE ASKED TO TAKE A
 POSITION IN THIS CLASS, CORRECT?
 YES, I WAS ASKED TO TAKE MY
 POSITION.
 THEY ASKED HIM HIS OPINION.
 AFTER HE STATED HIS OPINION, THE
 TEACHER SAID CAN YOU PLEASE
 ELABORATE?
 AFTER HE ELABORATED, THE GIRL
 GOT UPSET AND SCREAMING AND
 YELLING AT HIM.
 THE TEACHER WAS TEN FEET INN'T
 FRO OF HIM AND COULDN'T HEAR
 HIM.
 NOW THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE BRINGING
 HIM UP FOR.
 HE WAS ATTACKED BY THEM.
 BUT THAT WAS OKAY.
 Jason: MICHAEL, I HAVE A
 SHORT AMOUNT O TIME HERE.
 YOU WERE ALSO ASKED TO TAKE A
 QUIZ DURING A WHITE PRIVILEGE
 SEMINAR.
 WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
 I WAS NOT PART OF A WHITE
 PRIVILEGE SEMINAR.
 THAT WAS A REQUIRED WORK
 STATION.
 I DIDN'T GO TO THAT.
 THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORK
 STATIONS ON MARTIN LUTHER KING
 DAY.
 HE WAS IN WORKSHOP.
 THERE THEY HAD THE BUZZ FEED
 SURVEY AS TO HOW PRIVILEGED YOU
 ARE.
 SOME OF THEM WERE WHITE
 PRIVILEGED, TOXIC MASCULINITY.
 WHEN MICHAEL WAS OFFENDED, HE
 ASKED WHY IS THAT OKAY.
 AND THEN THEY STARTED THAT SINCE
 YOU'RE A MAJORITY A WHITE
 STRAIGHT MALE, THE BAR TO OFFEND
 YOU IS SET HIGHER THAN FOR
 OTHERS.
 STATING THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE
 SAME RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES AS
 EVERYBODY ELSE.
 Jason: MICHAEL, I WISH YOU
 THE BEST.
 FOR EVERY DARK SPOT, SOMETHING
 GOOD TO LEARN FROM IT.
 I HOPE YOU LEARNED FROM IT AND
 TAKE IT AS A POSITIVE AND
 REMEMBER IF YOU DON'T LIKE BEING
 TREATED THAT WAY, MAKE SURE
 NOBODY ELSE IS TREATED THAT WAY.
 BUT IT'S GOOD OF YOU AND YOUR
 FATHER TO JOIN US HERE TONIGHT.
 WE APPRECIATE IT.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE
    It's going to be Passover
        in just a few days.
     And these people are in     desperate need.
 These are very difficult times for Israel and the Jewish people.
     As the government spends
 more and more of it's resources for battling terrorism.
   The situation has become a   crisis.
 Every week the lines get longer and longer.
 There are more people who come than they expect
    because the numbers keep    growing.
   Its difficult to have to see
     people in this situation
 ■■■z■■
   Especialis holiday   sePassover.
  This should be a blessing to  you.
        This $25 food box
  will provide one desperately  needy family
          here in Israel
       with food, with hope
 and with a note inside each of these
  saying that's its from  Christians and Jews in America
 o seek to bless them.
  With your phone call right now
  a food box will go out to one  desperate family in Israel.
 ■■■■he food box
   is a special note that will   bless them
        and let them know
  that America stands strong in  solidarity with Israel
 in their struggle for survival.
   Many of these people are ill
   they're sick, they're alone.
  They don't have the money to  afford
 things that many of us, most of us, take for granted.
  People, who don't have enough  money to even buy some matza
   the unleavened bread as the   Bible describes it.
 Israel and it's people n help now.
  You can make a life changing  difference
 by calling and saying that you give a $25 food box
   to help a family in need in   Israel.
 Thank you and God bless you for your support.
      My experience with USAA
        has been excellent.
      They really appreciate      the military family
       and it really shows.
     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we would call
    another insurance company,
 ■÷?■can't beat USAA”       It was funny because       when we would call
     We're the Webber family.
