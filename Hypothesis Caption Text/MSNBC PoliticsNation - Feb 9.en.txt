>> THANK YOU, JAMELEAH. 
>> THANK YOU, JAMELEAH. UP NEXT, MY FINAL THOUGHTS. UP NEXT, MY FINAL THOUGHTS. STAY WITH US. Since my DVT blood clot I was thinking... could there be another around the corner? Or could it turn out differently? I wanted to help protect myself. My doctor recommended ELIQUIS. ELIQUIS is proven to treat and help prevent another DVT or PE blood clot... Almost 98 percent of patients on ELIQUIS didn't experience another. ...and ELIQUIS has significantly less major bleeding than the standard treatment. ELIQUIS is FDA approved and has both. <i> Don't stop ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to.</i> <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious</i> <i> and in rare cases</i> <i> fatal bleeding.</i> <i> Don't take ELIQUIS if you have</i> <i> an artificial heart valve</i> <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i> <i> If you had a spinal injection</i> <i> while on ELIQUIS</i> <i> call your doctor right away</i> <i>if you have tingling, numbness,</i> <i> or muscle weakness.</i> <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i> <i> you may bruise more easily...</i> <i> and it may take</i> <i> longer than usual</i> <i> for bleeding to stop.</i> <i> Seek immediate medical care</i> <i> for sudden signs of bleeding,</i> <i> like unusual bruising.</i> <i> ELIQUIS may increase</i> <i> your bleeding risk</i> <i> if you take certain medicines.</i> <i> Tell your doctor</i> <i> about all planned medical</i> <i> or dental procedures.</i> What's around the corner could be surprising. Ask your doctor about ELIQUIS. Let's be honest: dealing with your insurance can be frustrating. But with Esurance, just snap some pics and you could get back on the road fast! Well, not that fast. This editor made this commercial fit in 15 seconds. When insurance is simple, it's surprisingly painless. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS YOU CAN'T MAKE A 400 HORSEPOWER SEDAN, THAT'S ALSO ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS. WE DON'T FOLLOW CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.
