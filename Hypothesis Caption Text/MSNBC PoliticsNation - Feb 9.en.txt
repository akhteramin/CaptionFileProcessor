 THAT WRAPS IT UP FOR US THIS
 HOUR ON MSNBC% I'M RICHARD LUI.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
 SEE YOU NEXT SATURDAY AT 4:00
 P.M.
 YOU CAN FOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK
 AND TWITTER.
 NOW I TURN IT OVER TO REVEREND
 AL SHARPTON AND
 "POLITICSNATION."
 GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO
 "POLITICSNATION."
 TONIGHT'S LEDE, PAUL MANAFORT
 RECEIVES LESS JAIL TIME THAN
 THOUSANDS OF AMERICA'S
 NONVIOLENT PRISONERS FOR
 DEFRAUDING THE NATION TO THE
 TUNE OF MILLIONS.
 AND FOR THAT, JUST 47 MONTHS.
 LESS THAN FOUR YEARS.
 THAT WAS THE RULING FROM A
 FEDERAL JUDGE IN VIRGINIA WHERE
 HE WAS SENTENCED THURSDAY FOR
 FINANCIAL FRAUD, NOT FOR
 ALLEGEDLY CONSPIRING WITH
 FOREIGN AGENTS.
 A DISTINCTION THE JUDGE THE
 VIRGINIA EMPHASIZED SUNDAY.
 SO PRESIDENT TRUMP MISSED THE
 POINT TWEETING FRIDAY, QUOTE,
 BOTH THE JUDGE AND THE LAWYER IN
 THE PAUL MANAFORT CASE STATED
 LOUDLY AND FOR THE WORLD TO HEAR
 THERE WAS NO COLLUSION WITH
 RUSSIA.
 BUT WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
 DESPERATELY CONTROLLING THE
 MEDIA NARRATIVE, THE PRESIDENT
 LOST YET ANOTHER COMMUNICATIONS
 DIRECTOR THIS WEEK.
 FORMER FOX NEWS EXECUTIVE BILL
 SHINE, JUST AS HE'S GEARING UP
 FOR HIS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN,
 WHICH WILL BE EXECUTED BY HALF
 OF MY PANEL TONIGHT WHO JOINS ME
 FROM DALLAS, KATRINA PEARSON.
 AND WITH ME HERE ON SET, DAVID
 BROCK, CHAIRMAN OF AMERICAN
 BRIDGE 21st CENTURY.
 LET ME GO TO YOU FIRST, KATRINA.
 THE PRESIDENT IS CLEARLY OFF ON
 HIS FACTS WHEN HE SAYS THAT, YOU
 KNOW, THIS JUDGE AND EVERYONE IS
 SAYING HE'S CLEARED OF RUSSIAN
 COLLUSION.
 THIS WAS NOT ABOUT THAT.
 THAT WOULD BE WEDNESDAY.
 BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD A KIND
 OF ROUGH WEEK FROM MICHAEL COHEN
 TO NOW BILL SHINE, HIS
 COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR LEAVING.
 AND WE SEE OTHER THINGS ON THE
 HORIZON.
 IS BILL SHINE'S RESIGNATION A
 RESULT OF THE CONTINUING MEDIA
 ATTENTION ON THIS CONNECTION
 BETWEEN FOX NEWS AND THE
 PRESIDENT, THE HEIGHT OF WHICH
 WAS THE "NEW YORKER" MAGAZINE
 PIECE THAT REALLY OUTLINED IN
 VERY, VERY GRAPHIC DETAILS HOW
 FOX NEWS HAS COVERED AND REALLY
 BECOME JUST TOTALLY DONALD
 TRUMP'S TELEVISION.
 GOOD EVENING, REVEREND AND
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I WOULD
 LIKE TO UNPACK, FIRST YOU
 STARTED WITH THE MANAFORT
 SENTENCING AND THE PRESIDENT'S
 STATING EXACTLY WHAT THE JUDGE
 SAID.
 IT WAS A REMINDER TO EVERYONE
 THAT THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
 THE RUSSIA COLLUSION HOAX, AND I
 THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT --
 NO IT HAD NOTHING -THE
 SENTENCING ON THAT CASE HAD
 NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
 THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE
 JUDGE SAID --
 NOR THE CHARGES.
 WAIT A MINUTE, I'LL LET YOU
 TALK THEN YOU LET ME TALK.
 HE SAID THAT THE SENTENCING HAD
 NOTHING TO DO -HE DID NOT SAY
 THERE WAS NO RUSSIAN COLLUSION.
 THE JUDGE DID SPECIFICALLY
 STATE THAT THIS ENTIRE CASE HAD
 NOTHING TO DO WITH COLLUSION OR
 RUSSIA.
 THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.
 SO IT'S WORTH NOTING AND
 STATING BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN
 IN THIS MANIC REACTION TO THE
 SENTENCING REFORM.
 YOU HAD ELECTED OFFICIALS ON
 THIS NETWORK SAYING THAT PAUL
 MANAFORT IS SOMEHOW AN ENEMY OF
 THE STATE AND HOW HE PERPETUATED
 AN ATROCITY AGAINST A DEMOCRACY.
 WE WILL SEE THE SENTENCING ON
 THAT ON WEDNESDAY.
 THAT'S MY POINT, REVEREND,
 THERE NO SENTENCING ON
 COLLUSION.
 THERE ARE NO RUSSIA COLLUSION
 CHARGES TO BE SENTENCED.
 WELL, I THINK ON WEDNESDAY
 WHEN HE IS SENTENCED AND GOING
 FORWARD WE WILL SEE WHAT THAT
 JUDGE SAYS AND WE WILL SEE WHAT
 COMES OUT OF THESE RUSSIAN
 COLLUSION INVESTIGATIONS.
 THAT IS NOT -THAT'S FAR FROM
 OVER.
 BUT AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT WAS
 INCORRECT IN HIS SAYING THAT THE
 JUDGE SAID THERE IS NO RUSSIAN
 COLLUSION.
 THERE WAS NONE IN THAT CASE.
 BUT YOU ARE AVOIDING MY QUESTION
 ON BILL SHINE AND THE CONNECTION
 WITH FOX NEWS AND WHETHER IT WAS
 CONNECTED WITH "NEW YORKER."
 YOU'RE VERY TRUMPIAN, YOU ARE
 AVOIDING THE ISSUE.
 NO, I'M ACTUALLY NOT.
 I JUST WANTED TO TAKE EACH ONE
 CASE BY CASE.
 BUT I ONLY ASKED ONE
 QUESTION.
 LET'S DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF
 BILL SHINE.
 I THINK THAT IT'S FALSE TO
 SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS LOST
 BILL SHINE.
 BILL SHINE IS SIMPLY
 TRANSFERRING TO THE CAMPAIGN.
 THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON WHEN IT
 COMES TO HIGH-PROFILE
 INDIVIDUALS IN A WHITE HOUSE
 GOING TO THE CAMPAIGN.
 DAVID AXELROD DID IT IN 2012.
 JAMES BAKER STEPPED DOWN AS
 SECRETARY OF STATE TO LEAD
 GEORGE W. BUSH'S EFFORTS.
 IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FOX
 NEWS OR ANY INVESTIGATION
 SURROUNDING THE WHITE HOUSE
 BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY YOU CAN
 CHOOSE FROM.
 HE HASN'T LOST ANYTHING BECAUSE
 BILL SHINE WILL BE VERY MUCH
 ENGAGED IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 ORBIT AS WELL AS WITH THE
 RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
 DAVID, I THINK WHAT IS
 DIFFERED, THOUGH, ABOUT AXELROD
 AND OTHERS IS I DON'T THINK ANY
 PRESIDENT IN TWO AND A HALF
 YEARS HAD AS MANY COMMUNICATIONS
 DIRECTORS COME AND GO AS THIS
 PRESIDENT HAS.
 AND THAT IS PROBABLY THE
 DIFFERENCE.
 NOR DO I THINK YOU'VE HAD THIS
 WILD KIND OF ASSOCIATION OF ONE
 NETWORK WITH ONE PRESIDENT AT
 THE TIME THAT SHINE RESIGNED WAS
 THE TIME THIS "NEW YORKER" PIECE
 WAS REALLY BEING TALKED ABOUT.
 RIGHT.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE
 THAT THE "NEW YORKER" CAME OUT
 THIS WEEK AND SHOWED THAT WHAT
 WE'VE ALL KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME
 THAT FOX NEWS IS A PROPAGANDA
 OUTLET.
 IT IS NIGHT AND DAY RELENTLESS
 PRO-TRUMP, THAT THE PRESIDENT
 GETS HIS TALKING POINTS FROM FOX
 NEWS IN THE MORNING AND THERE'S
 AN INSIDIOUS FEEDBACK LOOP.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT IT
 IS, IT COULD BE THAT SHINE'S
 ROLL WITH THE FOX CONNECTION
 BECAME SUPERFLUOUS BECAUSE
 RUPERT MURDOCK IS TALKING
 REGULARLY AND SEAN HANNITY IS
 TALKING TO DONALD TRUMP.
 AND THAT'S NOT JOURNALISM, REV.
 SINCE YOU ARE NOW, KATRINA,
 DEALING WITH THE RE-ELECTION,
 THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT HOW
 HE WAS GOING TO DO ALL THESE
 THINGS IN TERMS OF THE DEFICIT,
 IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY, AND YET
 WE ARE SEEING RECORD DEFICIT.
 I'M GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT
 LATER IN THE SHOW, $891 BILLION
 TRADE DEFICIT.
 HOW DO YOU RUN FOR RE-ELECTION
 WHEN HE'S DONE THE EXACT
 OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE PROMISED THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE, INCLUDING HIS
 BASE?
 WELL, FIRST LET ME JUST SAY
 THAT THAT NO ONE AT FOX NEWS WAS
 GIVING DONALD TRUMP DEBATE
 QUESTIONS.
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
 DEFICIT NOW.
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -KATRINA,
 KATRINA.
 ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO
 DO ON THIS SHOW IS WE'RE GOING
 TO DEFICIT.
 A DEFICIT.
 HE RAN THAT HE COULD MANAGE THE
 DEFICIT, HE ATTACKED HIS
 PREDECESSORS ABOUT THE DEFICIT.
 HOW DO YOU RUN FOR RE-ELECTION
 WHEN YOU'VE DONE THE TOTAL
 OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU PROMISED,
 PEOPLE INCLUDING YOUR BASE.
 THAT'S THE QUESTION.
 LOOK, REVEREND, IT'S NOT THE
 TOTAL OPPOSITE.
 I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN IN
 OFFICE FOR TWO YEARS NOW.
 AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
 THAT TRADE DEFICITS, FOR
 EXAMPLE, HAVE BEEN AN EXTREME
 PROBLEM, AND THIS IS ONE
 PRESIDENT THAT HAS PUT AMERICA
 FIRST WHEN IT COMES TO
 RENEGOTIATING TRADE AGREEMENTS.
 WHAT WE DO SEE HAPPENING IS
 RECORD NUMBER OF JOBS COMING
 BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES.
 WE SEE UNEMPLOYMENT AS AN
 ALL-TIME LOW.
 WE SEE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 UNEMPLOYMENT HISTORICALLY AT
 LOWER LEVELS BECAUSE HE IS
 EMPOWERING THE ECONOMY BY BY
 TAKING ON --
 UNEMPLOYMENT WAS GOING DOWN
 BEFORE HE CAME IN AND IT JUST
 CONTINUED.
 IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
 FACT THAT HE PROMISED HE WAS
 GOING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE
 DEFICIT.
 THE DEFICIT, DAVID, IS HIGHER
 THAN IT HAS BEEN, AND HE IS THE
 ONE, NOT HIS OPPONENTS OR HIS
 CRITICS, THAT SAID HE WOULD
 MANAGE AND DEAL WITH IT.
 THAT HAS NOT NOT HAPPENED.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 HE CAME INTO OFFICE SAYING WITH
 HIS CREDENTIAL THAT HE WAS A
 BUSINESSMAN.
 HE SAID HE WOULD SOLVE THIS
 PROBLEM OF THE DEFICIT.
 WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A
 BALLOONING DEFICIT WE'LL HAVE TO
 PAY FOR, WE'RE GOING TO PAY THE
 PRICE AT SOME POINT.
 AND IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
 DONALD TRUMP BETRAYING
 CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES TIME AND
 AGAIN.
 THIS IS USUALLY A CONSERVATIVE
 ISSUE.
 AND HE'S LOST ON IT.
 TIME AND AGAIN FROM BETRAYING

 OUR ALLIES, THIS PRESIDENT HAS
 NO IDEOLOGICAL CORE.
 WHAT HAPPENED IN NORTH KOREA,
 KATRINA?
 NOTHING HAPPENED.
 THE PRESIDENT GAVE ONE VERSION,
 THE NORTH KOREANS GAVE ANOTHER
 VERSION.
 CAN YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT YOU
 KNOW IF YOU KNOW?
 I CAN JUST SHARE WITH YOU
 WHAT I THINK.
 WE HAVE NOT HAD THIS DISCUSSION
 AT THE CAMPAIGN.
 THAT IS A WHITE HOUSE QUESTION.
 BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THANK YOU
 AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT DEMOCRATS
 ARE NOW SUDDENLY CONCERNED WITH
 THE DEFICIT.
 BUT WITH REGARDS TO NORTH KOREA,
 IT'S VERY TELLING THAT PRESIDENT
 TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN
 PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 THAT HE WOULD DO WHATEVER IT
 TOOK TO TRY AND RESOLVE THESE
 MAJOR ISSUES AROUND THE WORLD,
 NORTH KOREA BEING ONE OF THEM.
 OF COURSE WE EXPECT NORTH KOREA
 TO GIVE THEIR OWN VERSION OF
 THINGS.
 I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS
 SURPRISED THAT THEY HAVE THEIR
 OWN PROPAGANDA THAT THEY PUSH
 OUT.
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, MANY
 AMERICANS ARE ACTUALLY PLEASED
 THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ACTUALLY
 TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN
 ENDING THE WAR IN KOREA AND
 BRINGING BACK OUR SOLDIERS.
 IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
 OVERNIGHT.
 BUT I THOUGHT THEY HAD THIS
 GREAT LOVE AFFAIR AND THEY HAD
 THIS GREAT KIND OF BONDING GOING
 ON.
 YET HE WAS NOT ABLE TO MOVE THE
 MARK AND THERE ARE EVEN REPORTS,
 INCLUDING VIDEO, THAT THEY ARE
 NOW REBUILDING THEIR NUCLEAR
 PLAN WHERE THEY HAD PROMISED
 THAT THEY WERE, IN MANY WAYS,
 BRINGING DOWN OR TRYING TO --
 PRESIDENT AND OTHERS WERE
 LEADING US TO BELIEVE THAT THERE
 WAS MOVING TOWARD THEIR
 DENUCLEARIZING AND IT SEEMS LIKE
 THE OPPOSITE IS HAPPENING NOW.
 THAT'S APPARENTLY WHAT IT
 MIGHT SEEM LIKE IF YOU BELIEVE
 THE MEDIA, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE
 OUR STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE
 PRESIDENT, AND I BELIEVE THAT IN
 GOOD FAITH THINGS ARE MOVING --
 WHEN YOU SEE VIDEO OF THEM --
 THINGS ARE MOVING FORWARD.
 BUT WHEN YOU SEE, DAVID,
 THERE ARE VIDEOS SHOWING WHERE
 THE ACTUAL NUCLEAR SITE IS BEING
 REDEVELOPED, THIS IS NOT MEDIA.
 IT'S NOT.
 AND NORTH KOREA WILL NOT
 SAY -THEY'RE NOT DENYING THAT
 THEY HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY
 KIND OF DENUCLEARIZATION, SO
 THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE MEDIA.
 IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MEDIA AT
 ALL.
 IT'S ABOUT OUR INTELLIGENCE AND
 PROOF.
 THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT RESPECT
 OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, BUT
 THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOES.
 WHAT WE SEE TIME AND AGAIN IS
 DIPLOMACY WHERE TRUMP THINKS HE
 CAN COZY UP TO THESE OWEDOUS
 DICTATORS AND HE COMES UP EMPTY
 HANDED TIME AND AGAIN.
 KATRINA AND DAVID, DON'T GO
 AWAY.
 COMING UP FIRST, 14, THAT'S
 THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS WHO ARE
 OFFICIALLY RUNNING FOR 2020
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, ONE OF
 THEM IS JOINING US NEXT.
 BE RIGHT BACK.
               T. BE RIGHT BACK.

 WELCOME BACK. WE'RE ANTICIPATING MORE
 CANDIDATES WILL ANNOUNCE THEY'RE
 THEY'RE JOINING THIS CROWDED
 FIELD OF DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT IN 2020, BUT THIS WEEK
 WILL HE WHEN WE LEARNED OF A FEW
 BIG NAMES WHO ARE NOT.
 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, THE FORMER
 MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, ERIC
 HOLDER, THE FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY
 GENERAL, SENATOR SHARED BROWN OF
 OHIO, AND SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY
 OF OREGON, OH, AND ADD HILLARY
 CLINTON WHO ALSO SAID, QUOTE,
 I'M NOT RUNNING TO A NEW YORK
 CITY TELEVISION STATION.
 BUT BY JUDGING BY THE CANDIDATES
 WHO ARE RUNNING, THIS IS A
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY DIFFERENT FROM
 EVEN THREE YEARS AGO WHEN
 CLINTON LAST RAN.
 SOME SAY MORE LIBERAL, OTHERS
 SAY TOO LIBERAL TO BEAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 JOINING ME IS ONE OF THE
 CANDIDATES, FORMER HOUSING
 SECRETARY AND FORMER MAYOR OF
 SAN ANTONIO, JULIAN CASTRO.
 LET ME START BY ASKING YOU, MR.
 CASTRO, IN A CROWDED FIELD, HOW
 ARE ANY OF THE CANDIDATES
 DISTINGUISHING YOURSELVES?
 DOES IT MAKE IT WHERE YOU HAVE
 TO DO SOMETHING PROVOCATIVE TO
 EVEN BE NOTICED, OR DO YOU JUST
 RUN YOUR RACE HOPING YOUR
 MESSAGE BREAKS THROUGH, EVEN
 THOUGH YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE
 ON THE STAGE WITH YOU?
 IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU,
 REVEREND AL.
 FOR ME I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT
 THE THE FIRST THING THAT YOU
 SHOULD DO WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING
 FOR OFFICE IS TO TELL PEOPLE
 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO FOR THEM
 AND THEIR FAMILY IF THEY VOTE
 FOR YOU.
 IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT YOU WANT TO
 DO IF YOU'RE ELECTED.
 SO I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND
 ARTICULATE A STRONG, POSITIVE
 VISION FOR THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE.
 I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS 21st
 CENTURY MAKING THE UNITED STATES
 THE SMARTEST, THE HEALTHIEST,
 THE FAIREST, AND THE MOST
 PROSPEROUS NATION ON EARTH.
 I SEE MYSELF AS THE ANTITHESIS
 OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 HE'S BEEN THE MOST DIVISIVE
 PRESIDENT WE'VE HAD IN QUITE A
 WHILE.
 I'D LIKE TO BRING THE COUNTRY
 TOGETHER.
 I'VE DEMONSTRATED INTEGRITY AND
 HONEST.
 I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL
 AMERICANS AND NOT JUST A
 PRESIDENT FOR 37% THAT HE SEES
 AS HIS BASE.
 I'M FUNDAMENTALLY FOCUSED ON THE
 FUTURE.
 I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS
 COUNTRY ANYTHING AGAIN, I WANT
 TO MAKE IT BETTER THAN EVER FOR
 ALL AMERICANS.
 YOU ARE THE ONLY ANNOUNCED
 LATINO IN THE RACE.
 CERTAINLY WHEN WE DEAL WITH THE
 IDENTITY POLITICS PEOPLE WOULD
 YOU SAY THAT DISTINGUISHES YOU,
 BUT YOU ALSO SERVED ACROSS
 RACIAL AND NATIONALITY LINES AT
 HUD, AS MAYOR, SO YOUR MESSAGE
 COMES FROM A PLACE THAT YOU
 UNDERSTAND BUT HAS GONE TO A
 PLACE YOU CLEARLY OUTLINED HERE.
 IN YOUR HOME STATE OF TEXAS,
 THERE'S A LOT OF EXPLANATION
 THAT BETO O'ROURKE MAY RUN, AND
 HE'S EVEN AS LATE AS TODAY PUT
 OUT PEOPLE SHOULD SIGN UP TO BE
 THE FIRST TO KNOW WHAT HE
 DECIDES TO DO.
 WILL BETO O'ROURKE AFFECT YOUR
 CAMPAIGN, BOTH OF YOU COMING
 FROM TEXAS, BOTH OF YOU RAISING
 MONEY IN TEXAS IF HE WERE TO
 RUN, AS MANY OF US FEEL, WILL IT
 IMPACT OR ALTER IN ANY WAY YOUR
 CAMPAIGN.
 YEAH, YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO
 HAVE A VERY CROWDED PRIMARY
 ALREADY.
 I THINK WE HAVE 14 OR 15
 CANDIDATES THAT ARE RUNNING.
 I WAS PLEASED TO SUPPORT, HAPPY
 TO SUPPORT CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE
 WHEN HE RAN FOR SENATE AGAINST
 TED CRUZ.
 I THINK HE'S AN IMPRESSIVE
 CANDIDATE.
 I'M SURE HE'LL BRING HIS VOICE
 AND EXPERIENCE TO THE TABLE JUST
 LIKE ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES.
 THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHAT
 I DO.
 INS GOING TO CHANGE THE MESSAGE
 I'M DELIVERING OR THE EXPERIENCE
 I'LL OFFER IF I'M LEAKED
 PRESIDENT.
 SO I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON
 GETTING TO THE VOTERS IN THESE
 EARLY STATES AND THROUGHOUT THE
 COUNTRY.
 I MADE A PLEDGE ABOUT TWO WEEKS
 AGO TO VISIT EVERY SINGLE STATE
 IN OUR UNION.
 I STARTED IN IDAHO AND THEN WENT
 TO UTAH, TWO PLACES WHERE
 DEMOCRATS DON'T USUALLY GO.
 AND I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING
 THAT.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE HAVE 40
 PEOPLE IN THE RACE.
 I'M GOING TO SKETCH OUT MY OWN
 VISION FOR THE FUTURE AND LET
 THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY.
 MOST PEOPLE POLLED ARE SAYING
 THAT -I'M TALKING MOST
 DEMOCRATS, THAT THEY ARE REALLY
 WANTING A CANDIDATE THAT CAN
 DEFEAT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 YOUR ARRANGEMENT TO THOSE
 VOTERS, WHAT YOU FEEL IS THE
 MOST EMIGRATION THINGS THAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE THAT
 YOU WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY OR THE
 OPPOSITE OF IF YOU WERE TO BE
 ELECTED?
 I'D SAY TO RESTORE INTEGRITY
 AND HONESTY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
 THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT HAS
 BEEN MORE UNTRUTHFUL PROBABLY IN
 THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION'S
 HISTORY.
 PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER OF
 LIES HE'S TOLD ABOUT ANY NUMBER
 OF THINGS, AND IT'S DAMAGING OUR
 DEMOCRACY.
 I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
 PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE
 A GOVERNMENT THAT THEY CAN TRUST
 IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
 ON TOP OF THAT, I REALLY BELIEVE
 IT'S TIME FOR A PRESIDENT WHO IS
 TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER
 AND NOT TO TEAR THEM APART.
 WE NEED SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT
 ONLY, YOU KNOW, FOCUSED ON THE
 FUTURE AND HAS A STRONG AGENDA
 FOR THE FUTURE, BUT ALSO TRYING
 TO WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE WHEN
 IT'S APPROPRIATE, NOT JUST
 THROWING INSULTS OUT THERE
 EITHER TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN
 ANOTHER PARTY OR TO FOREIGN
 LEADERS.
 THIS PRESIDENT HAS DAMAGED OUR
 DEMOCRACY, AND I WOULD LIKE TO
 RETURN US TO A STRONG PATH FOR
 GROWTH, FOR PROSPERITY, FOR ALL
 AMERICANS IN THE YEARS TO COME.
 AND I WOULD SAY ALSO FOR THOSE
 WHO WONDER, WELL, HOW ARE YOU
 GOING TO BEAT THIS PRESIDENT?
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE BEAT THIS
 PRESIDENT BY TRYING TO BE THIS
 PRESIDENT.
 WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THIS
 PRESIDENT BY OFFERING A STRONG,
 POSITIVE VISION FOR THE FUTURE
 AND TRYING TO UNITE PEOPLE, AND
 FOCUSING ON ALL AMERICANS, NOT
 JUST WHAT THIS PRESIDENT DOES,
 WHICH IS JUST FOCUS ON 37% THAT
 HE CONSIDERS HIS BASE AND IF HE
 JUST BRINGS THOSE PEOPLE OUT,
 HE'S GOING TO WIN NARROWLY LIKE
 HE DID LAST TIME.
 HE LOST BY 2.8 MILLION VOTES IN
 THE POPULAR VOTE BUT HE THINKS
 HE CAN RUN THE TABLE AGAIN WITH
 THIS NARROW STRATEGY.
 I BELIEVE I CAN GO BACK AND GET
 MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, AND
 PENNSYLVANIA.
 WE ONLY LOST THEM BY LESS THAN
 80,000 VOTES NEXT TIME, AND I'M
 CONFIDENT IF I'M THE NOMINEE WE
 CAN GET THE 2019 ELECTORAL VOTES
 IN FLORIDA, THE 11 ELECTORAL
 VOTES OF ARIZONA, AND EVEN THE
 38 ELECTORAL VOTES IN TEXAS.
 YOU CAME OUT THIS WEEK ON THE
 LAST SEVERAL WEEKS SUPPORTING
 THE IDEA OF LOOKING INTO

 REPARATIONS FOR
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
 HOW DO YOU FEEL WE NEED DO DEAL
 WITH THOSE SEGMENTS IN THIS
 COUNTRY THAT HAVE A
 DISPROPORTIONATE -WE KEEP
 TALKING ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY'S
 DOING WELL, BUT IT IS STILL
 UNEVEN WHEN IT COMES TO BLACKS
 AND LATINOS.
 WELL, OF COURSE THAT'S TRUE.
 WHAT I SAID A COUPLE WEEKS AGO
 IS THAT I HAVE LONG BELIEVED
 THAT ONE OF THE WAYS WE SHOULD
 CONSIDER ADDRESSING THE ORIGINAL
 SIN OF SLAVERY IS REPARATIONS.
 I ASKED FOLKS, I SAID UNDER OUR
 CONSTITUTION WE COMPENSATE
 PEOPLE IF WE TAKE THEIR
 PROPERTY.
 SHOULDN'T PEOPLE BE COMPENSATED
 IF THEY WERE PROPERTY?
 THAT WAS SANCTIONED BY THE
 STATE?
 IN THIS CASE, SHOULDN'T BE
 COMPENSATE THEIR.
 TO FULLY MOVE FORWARD AS ONE
 NATION WITH ONE DESTINY THAT
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS
 THAT.
 AND THE WAY THAT I WOULD DRESS
 IT IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT IS
 BY APPOINTING A COMMISSION OF
 PEOPLE, OF DIFFERENT WALKS OF
 LIFE WHO UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE,
 A TASK FORCE TO COME UP WITH
 ACTION THAT WE CAN TAKE ON
 REPARATIONS.
 SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED, WELL,
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A
 COMMISSION INSTEAD OF JUST
 SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS?
 AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS
 BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS A
 SUBJECT PEOPLE VIEW DIFFERENTLY
 AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS WE
 CAN ADDRESS IT.
 AT THE END OF IT, WHAT WE WOULD
 LIKE IS FOR IT TO BE HEALING FOR
 THE COUNTRY.
 IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO
 PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION NOT ONLY
 TO THE END RESULT, BUT ALSO TO
 THE PROCESS TO GET THERE SO THAT
 IT CAN BRING AMERICANS TOGETHER
 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
 ALL RIGHT AND I THINK
 THAT'S DONE THROUGH A TASK
 FORCE.
 WE ALSO MUST HEAL THE
 INJURED.
 THANK YOU, JULIAN CASTRO.

 THAT'S APRIL 3rd TO THE 6th IN
 NEW YORK CITY.
 COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 HAS COMPLETELY FAILED IN ONE OF
 HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES.
 I'LL TELL YOU WHICH ONE NEXT.
  At Midas, with every oil change   you get a free tire rotation.
    Makes you feel like a king!
          King for a day!
  Well, maybe not the whole day.
   Our 19.99 or 49.99 oil change     includes a tire rotation.
 I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF
 THOSE BIG, ONCE-INCREDIBLE,
 JOB-PRODUCING FACTORIES AND MY
 WIFE, MELANIA, SAID WHAT
 HAPPENED?
 I SAID THOSE JOBS HAVE LEFT
 OHIO.
 THEY'RE ALL COMING BACK.

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 COMING BACK.
 DON'T MOVE.
 DON'T SELL YOUR HOUSE.
 YEP, TIME FOR MY WEEKLY MEMO
 TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 YOUR AMERICA-FIRST POLICIES ARE
 A DISASTER.
 AND AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF
 PAYING THE PRICE.
 YOU KEEP INSISTING WE'RE WINNING
 THIS TRADE WAR WITH CHINA AND
 THAT TRADE DEFICIT IS DOWN.
 WELL, THAT'S A FLATOUT LIE.
 THIS WEEK THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT
 IN GOODS HIT A RECORD HIGH OF
 $891 BILLION.
 THE SAME DAY THAT AUTO MAKER
 GENERAL MOTORS ANNOUNCED PLANS
 TO CLOSE YET ANOTHER ASSEMBLY
 PLANT AND CUTTING NEARLY 1,700
 JOBS.
 AND BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO GO
 AFTER CHINA ALONE INSTEAD OF
 BANDING TOGETHER WITH OUR
 ALLIES, AMERICAN FARMERS ARE
 BEARING THE BRUNT OF YOUR BAD
 DECISIONS.
 FARMERS ACROSS THE MIDWEST ARE
 FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY AT
 ALARMING RATES, NOT SEEN IN A
 DECADE.
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN YOU PROMISED
 THAT ELIMINATING OUR NATIONAL
 DEBT WOULD BE A PIECE OF CAKE.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
 NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A HISTORIC
 TRADE DEFICIT, BUT YOU AND
 REPUBLICANS WHO RAN CONGRESS FOR
 THE PAST TWO YEARS SPENT REAL
 BIG AND PASSED TAX CUT PACKAGES
 THAT STILL HASN'T BEEN PAID FOR.
 NOW YOUR WHITE HOUSE PLANS TO
 UNVEIL AN UNBALANCED BUDGET
 CALLING FOR MORE SPENDING ON
 IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WHILE
 SLASHING DOMESTIC PROGRAMS LIKE
 FOOD STAMPS AND FARM SUBSIDIES,
 I KNOW YOU TRIED TO SEAL YOUR
 SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT, BUT IT'S
 CLEAR YOU COULDN'T HAVE PASSED
 ECONOMICS 101 IF YOU THINK THIS
 IS PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.
 BE RIGHT BACK.
        They're America's  biopharmaceutical researchers.
    Driven each day to pursue      life-changing cures...
      In a country built on      fostering innovation.
 Here, they find breakthroughs...
  Like a way to fight cancer by
      arming a patient's own            T-cells...
 And a new therapy that gives the       blind a working gene
      so they can see again.
   Because it's not just about     the next breakthrough...
  It's all the ones after that.
 I THINK THERE HAS TO BE OPERATIONS AND WE CAN DISCUSS
 WHAT THAT IS.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE CORRECT
 COURSE WITHOUT INTERVENTION SO
 WE NEED CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT
 THAT INTERVETION SHOULD LOOK
 LIKE.
 I HAVE LONG BELIEVED THIS
 COUNTRY SHOULD RESOLVE ITS
 ORIGINAL SIN OF SLAVERY AND ONE
 OF THE WAYS WE SHOULD CONSIDER
 DOING THAT IS THROUGH
 REPARATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE
 THE DISSEN DENTS OF SLAVES.
 THE TOPIC OF REPARATIONS,
 ONCE POLITICAL RETRO ACTIVE,
 EVEN FOR DEMOCRATS, HAS FOUND
 ITS WAY INTO THE DEBATE WITH
 FOUR CANDIDATES ON RECORD AS
 ENDORSING SOME RESTITUTION FOR
 THE DESCENDANTS OF SAVES.
 THE HIGHEST AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN
 CONGRESS IS UNCONVINCED.
 MAJORITY WHIP JAMES CLYBURN WHO
 SAID THIS WEEK THAT, QUOTE, PURE
 REPARATIONS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
 TO IMPLEMENT.
 BACK WITH ME, KATRINA PIERSON,
 AND DAVID BROCK, CHAIRMAN OF
 AMERICAN BRIDGE 21st CENTURY.
 KATRINA, HOW ABOUT IT IS THIS IF
 THE CONGRESS PASSED A BILL,
 HOUSE AND SENATE, TO STUDY
 REPARATIONS, WOULD THE PRESIDENT
 SIGN THE BILL?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM ABOUT
 REPARATIONS, BUT TO YOUR LAST
 POINT, IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
 EVEN TRY TO COME UP WITH THE
 CRITERIA FOR THAT.
 I SAID IF THE BILL WAS A
 COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH TO STUDY
 IT, WOULD HE SIGN IT?
 IT WOULD HAVE TO GET THROUGH
 THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.
 SO I CAN'T ANSWER YOU QUESTION.
 IT'S A HYPOTHETICAL, REVEREND.
 AND I'M ASKING YOU WOULD HE
 SIGN IT AND SUPPORT IT?
 I CAN'T ANSWER.
 THE LAST SEGMENT YOU WERE IN,
 YOU SAID THAT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT
 WAS LOWER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN
 AND IT WAS GOING DOWN, BUT IT'S
 STILL ALMOST DOUBLE THAT TO
 WHITE.
 WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO
 DIRECTLY DEAL WITH THE
 DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF
 BLACKS TO WHITES?
 ONE OF THE POLICIES A LOT OF
 PEOPLE SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT IS
 FIGHTING BACK AGAINST ILLEGAL
 IMMIGRATION.
 YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT IMPACTS
 THE COMMUNITY WITH REGARDS TO I
 DON'T SAY AND WAGES.
 YOU'RE SAYING IMMIGRATION --
 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT
 MOVING IN TO GATED COMMUNITIES
 OR IN THE POLITICIANS'
 NEIGHBORS.
 YOU'RE ARGUING THAT ILLEGAL
 IMMIGRATION IS THE REASON THAT
 BLACKS ARE ALMOST DOUBLY
 UNEMPLOYED TO WHITES IN THIS
 COUNTRY?
 NO, YOU ASKED ME WHAT WAS A
 CONTRIBUTOR.
 I ASKED YOU WHAT HIS PLAN WAS
 TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT EVEN IN
 A GOOD ECONOMY, BLACKS ARE
 DOUBLY UNEMPLOYED TO WHITES.
 THAT'S WHAT I ASKED YOU.
 THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT GOOD
 ENOUGH THAT IT'S GONE
 DRASTICALLY LOW FOR YOU.
 SO LET ME SAY ONCE AGAIN --
 DAVID, LET ME GO TO YOU.
 BECAUSE WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
 EVEN IN GOOD TIMES -I GAVE YOU
 TWO OPPORTUNITIES.
 THESE ARE GREAT TIMES.
 YOU HAVEN'T EVEN DISCUSSED THE
 INFUSION THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS
 HAD AN INFUSION OF CAPITAL.
 THE REALITY IS PART OF HIS
 BASE IS ATTRACTED TO DONALD
 TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S A RACIST.
 SO THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY
 PLAN.
 ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THE GOOD
 NEWS IS, AS JULIAN CASTRO WAS
 JUST TALKING ABOUT ON THIS SHOW,
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE A
 GROUNDBREAKING DEMOCRATIC
 PRIMARY WHERE THESE ISSUES ARE
 RAISED, STRUCTURAL RACISM, THE
 INCOME DISPARITY THAT YOU JUST
 TALKED ABOUT.
 I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A
 HEALTHY DEBATE FOR THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 I THINK CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO
 STAKE OUT DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON
 THAT, BUT I THINK EVERYBODY WILL
 COME AROUND TO THE VIEW.
 AS A CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST IN
 "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SAID JUST
 ADDRESSING THE ISSUE WILL START
 TO HEAL THE COUNTRY.
 68% OF AMERICANS OPPOSITE
 PAYING BLACK AMERICANS WHO ARE
 DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES, BUT WHEN
 WE LOOK BY RACE, MOST WHITE
 AMERICANS OPPOSITE IT AND 60% OF
 BLACK AMERICANS ARE FOR IT.
 BUT LOOK AT THE DIVISION BY
 PARTY.
 WHILE 55% OF DEMOCRATS OPPOSITE
 REPARATIONS, THE NUMBER IS MUCH
 HIGHER IF YOU ASK REPUBLICANS.
 86% AGAINST IT.
 SO THERE IS THIS REAL DIFFERENCE
 IN TERMS OF WHERE WE LOOK AT
 REPARATIONS.
 AND THE QUESTION OF RACE IS
 DEFINITELY GOING TO BE IN THIS
 CAMPAIGN.
 LET ME ASK YOU THIS, KATRINA.
 HISTORICALLY, REPUBLICANS AND
 DEMOCRATS HAVE HAD MAJOR FIGURES
 OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN THE
 WEST WING AS PART OF THEIR
 SENIOR STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION.
 WHO ARE THE BLACKS IN THE WEST
 WING UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP?
 YOU MEAN THOSE WHO ACTUALLY
 TOOK THE JOB OR THOSE WHO'VE
 BEEN OFFERED?
 BECAUSE THOSE ARE ENTIRELY
 DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.
 THAT WORK IN THE WEST WING,
 LET ME -NO, I DIDN'T ASK YOU
 OFFER.
 I ASKED YOU -WAIT A MINUTE.
 LET ME ASK THE QUESTION.
 I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE
 NERVOUS.
 I'M NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE
 IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
 PAINT THIS PRESIDENT AS RACIST.
 CONNED LEE ZA RICE WITH BUSH,
 COLIN POWELL WITH BUSH SR., IS
 IT NOT A STRIKING CONTRAST, YET
 THEY WANT TO APPEAL FOR BLACK
 VOTES.
 I ASKED YOU TO NAME THEM --
 BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO
 PARTICIPATE IN THE ATTEMPT TO
 MAKE THIS ALL ABOUT RACE.
 IT'S RIDICULOUS.
 HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE WERE IN
 ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S WEST WING?
 FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE GOT TO
 GO BACK TO ABE LINCOLN, YOU
 REALLY NEED TO -GEORGE BUSH.
 IS ABRAHAM LINCOLN A RACIST
 BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE A BLACK
 PERSON IN THE WHITE HOUSE?
 THE THIS IS INSANE.
 THIS IS AN INSANE DISCUSSION.
 YOU CAN'T NAME A BLACK IN THE
 WEST WING BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND
 ONE, KATRINA.
 I PITY YOU.
 I'D SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU, COME
 ON.
 IT'S UNTHINKABLE IN THE 21st
 CENTURY THAT EVEN A SPOKESPERSON
 FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN'T NAME A
 BLACK IN THE WEST WING.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 AND YOU CONTRAST THAT WITH THE
 RANGE OF DIVERSITY OF OUR
 CANDIDATES ON OUR SIDE OF THE
 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY THIS TIME,
 THE RECORD NUMBER OF DIVERSE
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ELECTED ON
 THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THIS LAST
 TIME.
 IT'S SUCH A STARK CONTRAST AND
 IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT THAT YOU
 CAN'T COME UP WITH ONE NAME.
 IT'S EXACTLY NOT AN
 EMBARRASSMENT.
 THIS GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW
 RIDICULOUSLY PATHOLOGICAL
 IDENTICAL POLITICS IS IN THIS
 COUNTRY WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
 LIKE WILL SMITH, WHO IS NOT EVEN
 CONSIDERED BLACK ENOUGH TO
 PORTRAY A BLACK MAN IN
 HOLLYWOOD.
 KATRINA, YOU BROUGHT UP, YOU,
 EARLIER IN THE SHOW, HOW BLACK
 UNEMPLOYMENT WAS SO LOW.
 THAT WASN'T IDENTICAL POLITICS.
 YES.
 BUT WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT A
 BLACK IN THE WEST WING, IT'S
 IDENTICAL POLITICS.
 AND YOU WONDER WHY THERE'S A
 PROBLEM WITH BLACK VOTERS?
 IF YOU WANT TO IDENTITY BLACK
 UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS BUT CAN'T
 IDENTITY A PROGRAM TO MAKE THEM
 EQUAL TO THE REGULAR
 UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS, THAT'S NOT
 IDENTITY POLITICS.
 BUT YOU WON'T LET ME SPEAK TO
 TALK ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS, LIKE
 THE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO
 MINORITY BUSINESSES AND MONEY
 THAT'S GOING TO USE.
 I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE
 POLICIES.
 I GAVE YOU EVERY OPPORTUNITY
 AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MORE.
 MAYBE YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY IN
 THE WEST WING BEFORE WE HAVE YOU
 COMMON.
 THANK YOU, KATRINA PIERSON, AND
 THANK YOU, DAVID BROCK.
 COMING UP, HIP HOP ARTISTS
 ARE GOING TO THE SUPREME COURT.
 I'LL EXPLAIN NEXT.

        Hey, who are you?
 Oh, hey Jeff, I'm a car thief...
              What?!
           I'm here to     steal your car because,
       well, that's my job.
              What?
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What?!
             [crash]
              WHAT?!
        Haha, it happens.
        And if you've got     cut-rate car insurance,
      paying for this could
 feel like getting robbed twice.
        So get Allstate...
     and be better protected
          from Mayhem...
             like me.

 NOW TIME FOR SOME HIP HOP. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, RAP MUSIC
 HAS BEEN JUDGED BOTH FAIRLY AND
 UNFAIRLY ON ITS PROVOCATIVE
 LYRICS AND OCCASIONAL BLAMED FOR
 INCITING VIOLENCE.
 THAT DEBATE WAS ELEVATED TO THE
 HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND THIS
 WEEK WHEN A COALITION OF HIP HOP
 ARTISTS FILED A LEGAL BRIEF WITH
 THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
 ON BEHALF OF PITTSBURGH RAPPER
 JAMAL KNOX, STAGE NAME MAYHEM
 MILE.
 IN
 IN PRISON FOR LYRICS THREATENING
 TWO POLICE OFFICERS IN A 2012
 SONG.
 ALLIES ARE CONTENDING THAT HIS
 LYRICS WHILE PROVOCATIVE, FALL
 WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PROTECTED
 SPEECH BUT ARE BEING SUBJECTED
 TO A DOUBLE STANDARD THAT IS
 UNIQUE TO HIP HOP.
 JOINING ME NOW, JAMILLA LAMAL,
 COLUMNIST AND STRATEGIST.
 WHICH WHOLE QUESTION OF WHY THEY
 HAVE GONE AFTER THIS PARTICULAR
 ARTIST, THIS PARTICULAR RAPPER,
 AND NOW MANY IN THE HIP HOP
 COMMUNITY HAVE COME TOGETHER AND
 HAVE FILED A BRIEF ON HIS
 BEHALF, GIVE US THE BACKGROUND
 AND THE CONTENTION HERE.
 WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
 DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR
 DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN
 THIS COUNTRY, AS WE KNOW, AND
 UNFORTUNATELY THIS YOUNG MAN HAS
 NOT BEEN ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS
 LEGAL -TO EXERCISE HIS LEGAL
 RIGHT, TO EXPRESS HIMSELF
 CREATIVELY.
 A LOT OF US TAKE ISSUE WITH THE
 VIOLENCE THIS RAP MUSIC.
 IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE SPOKEN
 OUT ABOUT IN THE PAST, IT'S
 SOMETHING I TAKE ISSUE WITH.
 LEGALLY THE ARTISTS HAVE THE
 RIGHT TO SAY THINGS WE FIND TO
 BE ABHORRENT.
 HIS RECORD THAT SPEAKS OF
 VIOLENCE AGAINST POLICE
 OFFICERS, WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK
 AT ENTERTAINMENT FROM OTHER
 GENERAS OF MUSIC, AND SAY HEY,
 THERE ARE DEPICTIONS OF RAPE
 HERE, ACTS OF VIOLENCE THAT ARE
 NOT BEING PORTRAYED BY YOUNG
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN.
 WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THOSE AND
 TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY.
 WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO IS THAT
 IF A YOUNG BLACK MAN RECORDS A
 SONG SAYING HE'S GOING TO DO
 SOMETHING VIOLENT TOWARDS A
 POLICE OFFICER, THAT THAT'S TO
 BE TAKEN AS A LEGITIMATE THREAT
 WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES
 OF POLICE OFFICERS MAKING JOKES
 ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ON FACEBOOK, IN
 PRIVATE GROUPS, ON E-MAILS
 DESCRIBING VIOLENCE AGAINST
 MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT
 THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT AND
 SERVE, AND THOSE THREATS, MANY
 OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ACTED UPON,
 AREN'T PUNISHED.
 WHAT WE'RE REALLY SAYING HERE
 IS THE ISSUE OF DOUBLE STANDARD,
 WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THE LYRICS
 OR NOT, AS YOU SAID, SOME OF US
 HAVE OPPOSED SOME LYRICS OR NOT,
 THE DOUBLE STANDARD BECAUSE IT
 SEEMS SOME ARE REACHING A LEVEL
 OF CRIMINALITY AND OTHERS ARE
 JUDGED AS FREE SPEECH AND YOU
 CAN'T HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD IF
 YOU'RE HAVING -PARTICULARLY IF
 YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL IN THE
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 NOW, THE ARTISTS THAT ARE
 SUPPORTING HIM, THE BASIS OF
 THEIR BRIEF TO THE SUPREME COURT
 IS THAT FREE SPEECH.
 IF YOU DEEMED OTHER GENERAS OF
 MUSIC THAT ALSO PROMOTES
 VIOLENCE AND OTHER THINGS IS
 FREE SPEECH, HOW IS THIS
 DIFFERENT?
 IS THAT THE BASIS?
 AM I CORRECT ON THAT?
 IS THAT THE BASIS OF THEIR
 BRIEF?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 THAT IS THE BASIS OF THIS
 ARGUMENT.
 TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
 THE HYPERBOLIC LANGUAGE, WOULD
 MEAN WE NEED TO APPLY THAT
 STANDARD TO ALL MUSIC AND THAT'S
 SIMPLY NOT WHAT WE DO.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING
 WHEN SUPREME COURT JUSTICE JOHN
 ROBERTS MADE HIS ORIGINAL
 STATEMENTS ABOUT THIS THAT HE
 CHOSE TO CITE LYRICS BY THE
 RAPPER EMINEM AND THAT'S NOT
 LIKELY SOMEBODY WHO'S LIKELY TO
 HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO
 PUNISHMENT FOR THE THINGS HE
 SAID UNDER THESE GROUNDS EVEN
 THOUGH HIS MUSIC IS CHALK FULL
 OF REFERENCE TO VIOLENCE AGAINST
 HIS MOTHER, HIS FORMER PARTNER
 BUT THIS LITTLE KNOWN ARTIST WHO
 RECORDS A SONG USING LANGUAGE
 THAT HAS BEEN USED IN HIP HOP
 SINCE, YOU KNOW, NOT QUITE AT
 ITS INCEPTION BUT SINCE ITS VERY
 EARLY DAYS IS BEING TREATED AS
 SUCH IS JUST ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR,
 AND YOU KNOW, TO SUGGEST THAT
 THIS IS ANYTHING BUT RACISM JUST
 FEELS WRONG.
 IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE
 CAN'T PROVE, RIGHT, WE KNOW IN
 OUR GUT.
 WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
 TREATING THIS YOUNG BLACK MAN,
 YOU'RE TREATING THIS GENERA OF
 ART THAT IS CREATED LARGELY BY
 YOUNG BLACK MEN DIFFERENTLY THAN
 WE TREAT OTHER ART FORMS.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US YOU'RE
 DOING THIS BECAUSE THESE ARE
 YOUNG BLACK MEN BUT WE
 UNDERSTAND IT AND RECOGNIZE IT
 KNOW IT.
 THANK YOU, JAMELEAH.
 UP NEXT, MY FINAL THOUGHTS.
 STAY WITH US.

     Since my DVT blood clot
        I was thinking...
      could there be another        around the corner?
       Or could it turn out           differently?
         I wanted to help         protect myself.
            My doctor       recommended ELIQUIS.
       ELIQUIS is proven to      treat and help prevent
           another DVT       or PE blood clot...
       Almost 98 percent of       patients on ELIQUIS
    didn't experience another.
 ...and ELIQUIS has significantly
       less major bleeding
   than the standard treatment.
     ELIQUIS is FDA approved
          and has both.
        <i> Don't stop ELIQUIS</i>
 <i>unless your doctor tells you to.</i>
    <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious</i>
        <i> and in rare cases</i>         <i> fatal bleeding.</i>
  <i> Don't take ELIQUIS if you have</i>    <i> an artificial heart valve</i>
      <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>
  <i> If you had a spinal injection</i>         <i> while on ELIQUIS</i>
   <i> call your doctor right away</i>
 <i>if you have tingling, numbness,</i>       <i> or muscle weakness.</i>
      <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>
  <i> you may bruise more easily...</i>
         <i> and it may take</i>        <i> longer than usual</i>
      <i> for bleeding to stop.</i>
   <i> Seek immediate medical care</i>
  <i> for sudden signs of bleeding,</i>
      <i> like unusual bruising.</i>
       <i> ELIQUIS may increase</i>        <i> your bleeding risk</i>
  <i> if you take certain medicines.</i>
         <i> Tell your doctor</i>    <i> about all planned medical</i>
      <i> or dental procedures.</i>
     What's around the corner       could be surprising.
     Ask your doctor
      about ELIQUIS.
         Let's be honest:
        dealing with your  insurance can be frustrating.
        But with Esurance,
       just snap some pics
        and you could get      back on the road fast!
       Well, not that fast.
      This editor made this  commercial fit in 15 seconds.
    When insurance is simple,
   it's surprisingly painless.
     CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS
      YOU CAN'T MAKE A      400 HORSEPOWER SEDAN,
    THAT'S ALSO    ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS.
       WE DON'T FOLLOW       CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.

 AND NOW FOR MY FINAL THOUGHTS.
 ON THURSDAY, A JURY FOUND PALM
 BEACH GARDENS, FLORIDA POLICE
 OFFICER NEWMAN ROGER, GUILTY FOR
 THE FATAL SHOOTING OF
 31-YEAR-OLD CORY JONES WHO WAS
 WAITING FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE
 ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 18th,

 WHEN ROGER IN PLAIN CLOTHES AND
 DRIVING AN UNMARKED CAR STOPPED
 TO INVESTIGATE AND ULTIMATELY
 SHOT JONES, CONTENDING THAT HE
 WAS ARMED WITH A GUN.
 JONES WAS INDEED ARMED, LEGALLY,
 AND ACCORDING TO PROSECUTORS
 AFRAID FOR HIS LIFE WHEN HE WAS
 SHOT THREE TIMES BY ROGER WHO
 ACCORDING TO AUDIO FROM THE
 SCENE NEVER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF
 AS A COP.
 I WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT PREACHED
 AT CORY JONES' FUNERAL IN
 NOVEMBER OF 2015.
 AND ROGER WHO LATER LEFT THE
 FORCE USED AS HIS DEFENSE, STAND
 YOUR GROUND.
 THE JURY CONVICTED HIM.
 WHICH MEANS THAT AS WE LOOKED
 LAST WEEK AT THE LACK OF
 PROSECUTION IN SACRAMENTO AROUND
 STEPHAN CLARK, AND AROUND
 TERRANCE CRUTCHER IN TULSA,
 OKLAHOMA, THERE ARE SOME
 INJURIES THAT DO GET A CASE AND
 DO SAY A POLICEMAN IS WRONG.
 ALL POLICEMEN ARE NOT WRONG BUT
 ALL OF THEM ARE NOT RIGHT.
 WE MUST CORRECT A SYSTEM THAT
 SAYS THAT WE WILL DISTINGUISH
 CRIME WHETHER THE ACCUSED HAS ON
 A BLUE UNIFORM OR BLUE JEANS,
 TH
