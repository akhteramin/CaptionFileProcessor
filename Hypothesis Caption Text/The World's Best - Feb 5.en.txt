She's also taking prescription IBRANCE with an aromatase inhibitor, which is for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive HER2
- metastatic breast cancer as the first hormonal based therapy. IBRANCE plus letrozole was significantly more effective at delaying disease progression versus letrozole. Patients taking IBRANCE can develop low white blood cell counts, which may cause serious infections that can lead to death. Before taking IBRANCE, tell your doctor if you have fever, chills, or other signs of infection, liver or kidney problems, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant. Common side effects include low red blood cell and low platelet counts, infections, tiredness, nausea, sore mouth, abnormalities in liver blood tests, diarrhea, hair thinning or loss, vomiting, rash, and loss of appetite. Carla calls it her new normal because a lot has changed, but a lot hasn't. Ask your doctor about IBRANCE. The #1 prescribed FDA-approved oral combination treatment for HR+/HER2
