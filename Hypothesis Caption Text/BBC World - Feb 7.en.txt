 STAY CURIOUS.

 [APPLAUSE]

 AND NOW, "BBC WORLD NEWS."
 JANE: THIS IS "BBC WORLD NEWS
 AMERICA."
 REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON, I AM
 JANE O'BRIEN.
 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS ANNOUNCE
 NEW INVESTIGATIONS INTO
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 HE SAYS IT IS HARASSMENT.
 REVEALING THE DARK SIDE OF
 BRAZIL'S MINING INDUSTRY.
 TOXIC WASTE IS BEING HELD BACK
 BY DAMS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL
 TO COLLAPSE.
 IF THE WHOLE LOT BRAKES, ALL
 THESE TOXINS COULD ENTER THE
 WATER SUPPLY OF MILLIONS OF
 PEOPLE.
 JANE: BEHOLD THE ROVER.
 SOON IT WILL BE HEADING TO MARS
 BEARING THE NAME OF A
 GROUNDBREAKING SCIENTIST.

 JANE: WELCOME TO OUR VIEWERS ON PUBLIC TELEVISION IN AMERICA AND
 AROUND THE GLOBE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BRACING
 HIMSELF FOR A NEW WAVE OF
 INVESTIGATIONS AFTER A WARNING
 IN HIS STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH
 THAT SUCH MOVES WOULD ONLY HARM
 THE NATION.
 DEMOCRATS ON KEY OVERSIGHT
 COMMITTEES SAY THEY WILL DEMAND
 HIS TAX RETURNS AS PART OF
 BROADER INQUIRIES INTO HIS
 BUSINESS DEALINGS.
 THEY ARE ALSO REOPENING AN
 INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
 ELECTION MEDDLING AND POSSIBLE
 COLLUSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
 NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE PRESIDENT
 IS FURIOUS.
 TODAY HE TWEETED, "PRESIDENTIAL
 HARASSMENT.
 IT SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO
 HAPPEN AGAIN."
 I SPOKE A SHORT TIME AGO TO
 SHANNON PETTYPIECE OF BLOOMBERG.
 THERE ARE SO MANY
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 WHAT ARE THESE NEW
 INVESTIGATIONS LOOKING FOR AND
 WHAT MIGHT THEY FIND?
 SHANNON: THERE ARE SO MANY, AND
 THEY ARE SO BROAD AT THIS POINT.
 THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT NARROWED
 IT DOWN THE EXACT AREAS THEY
 WILL PROBE.
 THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT
 EVERYTHING FROM THE PRESIDENT'S
 HOTEL IN WASHINGTON AND WHETHER
 IT VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION,
 THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE TAX
 RETURNS, AS YOU MENTIONED, HIS
 CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA, HIS
 INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS DEALINGS --
 HIS HOTELS IN NEW YORK, PANAMA,
 PROJECTS IN CANADA.
 TO GO DEEP INTO HIS BUSINESS,
 HIS PERSONAL FINANCES, INTO HIS
 ADMINISTRATION.
 AND THEN THERE IS ALL THE THINGS
 THAT HAPPENED WHILE HE IS
 PRESIDENT -- SECURITY
 CLEARANCES, DEALINGS BY CABINET
 SECRETARIES.
 YES, IT COULD BE VERY BROAD.
 THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT NAILED
 DOWN THE FOCUS AND THEY HAVE TO
 DO THAT IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIMITED
 RESOURCES.
 JANE: HOW IS THIS GOING TO
 AFFECT THE WORKINGS OF THE WHITE
 HOUSE?
 SHANNON: IT COULD REALLY DRAG A
 LOT OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO A
 HALT.
 WHEN YOU TALK TO PAST WHITE
 HOUSES -- THE CLINTON WHITE
 HOUSE IS THE BEST PARALLEL TO
 THIS -- THE CONSTANT DRUMBEAT OF
 INVESTIGATIONS -- YOU HAVE THE
 WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE
 DEALING WITH A RESPONSE TO THE
 SUBPOENAS.
 PEOPLE WITH THE CLINTON
 ADMINISTRATION TOLD ME THERE
 BECOMES A GENERAL ANXIETY AND
 CONCERN IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- AM
 I GOING TO GET SUBPOENAED, THE
 STAFFERS START THINKING.
 THEY WORRY WHAT THEY SAID TO
 SOMEONE AND WHAT RECORDS WERE
 KEPT.
 AS FAR AS THE NEWS CYCLE GOES
 THERE WILL BE A DAILY DRUMBEAT
 OF SUBPOENAS, TESTIMONIES, NEW
 DOCUMENTS, AND THAT WILL
 DISTRACT FROM THE AGENDA OF
 OTHER THINGS THEY WOULD LIKE TO
 GET DONE AND BE TALKING ABOUT.
 JANE: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WARNED
 IN THE PAST THAT IF THE
 INVESTIGATIONS CROSSED A RED
 LINE, HE MIGHT DO SOMETHING
 ABOUT IT.
 WHAT CAN HE DO?
 SHANNON: WHEN IT COMES TO
 CONGRESS, NOT THAT MUCH.
 THAT IS WHY THIS SORT OF MAKES
 THE ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION
 LOOK LIKE A WARMUP ROUND.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT CONGRESS,
 SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT,
 AND THE ABILITY IT HAS AND THE
 LARGE SUBPOENA POWER IT HAS,
 THERE IS NOT MUCH HE CAN DO.
 HE CAN FIGHT BACK INSIDE -- HE
 CAN FIGHT BACK AND CITE
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ON SOME
 THINGS AND PUSH BACK ON
 SUBPOENAS, SAYING THAT THEY ARE
 IRRELEVANT, YOU ARE GOING AFTER
 PRIVATE COMPANIES.
 BUT CONGRESS DOES HAVE HER BROAD
 INVESTIGATIVE POWERS.
 HE HAS SEPARATE INVESTIGATIONS
 TO WORRY ABOUT -- NEW YORK IN
 THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT, OUTSIDE
 OF HIS CONTROL, CONTINUING TO
 PURSUE THINGS WITH HIS INAUGURAL
 COMMITTEE, THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF
 SOMEPLACE THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING
 AT.
 JANE: HE HAS ALREADY TWEETED.
 HOW ELSE MIGHT HE REACT?
 SHANNON: THE TWEET IS
 INTERESTING BECAUSE HE IS
 STARTING TO PICK A FIGHT BEFORE
 THE FIGHT HAS BEGUN, SOMETHING
 HE TENDS TO DO.
 YES, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TALKED
 BROADLY ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO
 INVESTIGATE, BUT IT IS NOT LIKE
 50 SUBPOENAS HAVE LANDED IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE,
 NOT LIKE THEY HAD DEMANDED HIS
 SON COME IN FOR A PUBLIC
 HEARING.
 THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR ALL OF
 THAT TO HAPPEN, BUT HE HAS GONE
 OUT AHEAD.
 WHAT THAT DOES IS POKE THE BEAR.
 IT GOES AFTER THE COMMITTEES AND
 RLES THEM UP, AND SOME MEMBERS
 FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO
 INVESTIGATE JUST TO SHOW THEM
 -- HIM THAT THEY HAVE THAT POWER
 AND THAT ABILITY TO DO SO.
 JANE: SHANNON PETTYPIECE, THANKS
 VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING ME.
 THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN VIRGINIA
 IS DEEPENING AMID ALLEGATIONS OF
 RACIAL AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY
 THE STATE'S LEADERS.
 THE THREE TOP DEMOCRATS ARE IN
 HOT WATER, BUT SO FAR THERE ARE
 NO SIGNS THEY ARE STEPPING DOWN,
 AND THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE.
 THE IMAGES IN THE 1968 YEARBOOK
 OF THE PRESTIGIOUS VIRGINIA
 MILITARY INSTITUTE ARE SHOCKING.
 IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE
 -- THAT TOMMY NORMENT, THE STATE
 SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, WAS THE
 EDITOR AT THE TIME.
 HE HAS DISTANCED HIMSELF, SAYING
 HE DID NOT OVERSEE EVERY PAGE OF
 THE PUBLICATION.
 MEANWHILE, TWO OF HER VIRGINIA'S
 TOP THREE DEMOCRATS HAVE
 ADMITTED TO PAST RACIST
 BEHAVIOR, AND THE LIEUTENANT
 GOVERNOR IS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL
 ASSAULT.
 JUSTIN FAIRFAX DENIES THE
 ALLEGATIONS, BUT HIS ACCUSER,
 VANESSA TYSON, HAS GIVEN NEW
 DETAILS OF THE ENCOUNTER IN

 IN A STATEMENT, SHE SAID,
 "CONSENSUAL KISSING QUICKLY
 TURNED INTO A SEXUAL ASSAULT."
 FAIRFAX DESCRIBED HER ACCOUNT AS
 PAINFUL, BUT SAID, "I HAVE NEVER
 DONE ANYTHING LIKE WHAT SHE
 SUGGESTS."
 NATIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE ADOPTED
 ZERO-TOLERANCE OF MEN ACCUSED OF
 SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
 THEY HAVE CALLED FOR AN
 INVESTIGATION OF THE
 ALLEGATIONS, BUT FEW HAVE
 DEMANDED FURTHER ACTION YET.
 THIS HAS BEEN AN AWFUL WEEK
 FOR VIRGINIA.
 JANE: GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM,
 WHOSE COLLEGE YEARBOOK PHOTO
 STARTED THE CRISIS, IS REFUSING
 TO RESIGN.
 STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL MARK
 HERRING, WHO ADMITTED WEARING
 BLACKFACE AT A PARTY IN THE
 1980'S, IS ALSO STAYING PUT FOR
 NOW.
 VIRGINIA IS A KEY POLITICAL
 BATTLEGROUND, BUT THE CRISIS
 THREATENS TO WEAKEN DEMOCRATS
 AHEAD OF STATE ELECTIONS IN
 NOVEMBER AND NEXT YEAR'S
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WHEN THEY
 WILL TRY TO DRAW A BRIGHT LINE
 BETWEEN THEIR CANDIDATE AND
 DONALD TRUMP.
 FOR MORE ON THE UPHEAVAL IN THE
 STATE, MY COLLEAGUES KATTY KAY
 AND CHRISTIAN FRASER SPOKE TO
 LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR OF THE
 CENTER OF POLITICS AT THE
 UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, AND THEY
 STARTED BY ASKING HIM ABOUT THE
 CURRENT LEVEL OF CHAOS.
 LARRY: WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS
 THAT THE ENTIRE ELECTED
 SUPERSTRUCTURE OF THE STATE IS
 NOW INVOLVED IN VARIOUS
 SCANDALS, AND WE JUST ADDED ONE.
 THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER
 OF THE STATE SENATE.
 SO IT IS NOW OFFICIALLY A
 BIPARTISAN SCANDAL.
 CHRISTIAN: AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
 LARRY, IF ALL THESE THREE
 DEMOCRATS WERE TO STEP DOWN, THE
 NEXT IN LINE TO BECOME GOVERNOR
 WOULD BE THE HOUSE SPEAKER, WHO
 IS A REPUBLICAN.
 LARRY: THAT IS RIGHT, AND THAT
 IS WHY IT WON'T HAPPEN.
 THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA VOTED
 OVERWHELMINGLY, REALLY IN
 LANDSLIDE PROPORTIONS, FOR
 DEMOCRATS IN 2017, AND THAT WAS
 TRUE FOR ALL THREE OF THEM.
 THAT WON'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IT IS
 CONTRARY TO THE POPULAR WILL AND
 IT WOULD BE SEEN AS A KIND OF
 SILENT COUP.
 THE PEOPLE WHO INSTIGATED SOME
 OF THESE CHARGES ARE CLEARLY
 CONNECTED TO THE REPUBLICAN
 PARTY AND SOME VERY CONSERVATIVE
 WEBSITES.
 SO IT IS JUST NOT GOING TO
 HAPPEN.
 THEY WILL FIND SOME WAY TO
 STAGGER RESIGNATIONS, IF IT EVEN
 COMES TO RESIGNATION, SO THAT A
 DEMOCRAT WILL SUCCEED TO THE
 GOVERNORSHIP, A DEMOCRAT WHO CAN
 STAY THERE.
 KATTY: LARRY, I WANT TO ASK YOU
 ABOUT JUSTIN FAIRFAX IN A
 SECOND, BUT FIRST OF ALL, THIS
 ISSUE OF RACE AND VIRGINIA AND
 TO WHAT EXTENT THE ACCUSATIONS
 AGAINST THE TWO DEMOCRATS WHO
 HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF BLACKENING
 THEIR FACES, TO WHAT EXTENT IS
 THAT REPRESENTATIVE OF
 VIRGINIA'S FAIRLY RECENT RACIAL
 PAST?
 LARRY: I THINK IT IS ALL TOO
 REPRESENTATIVE, TO BE BLUNT
 ABOUT IT.
 I WAS BORN IN THIS STATE AND
 GREW UP ABOUT A DECADE PRIOR TO
 THE TWO DEMOCRATS WHO ARE IN
 TROUBLE RIGHT NOW FOR BLACKFACE.
 I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT EVEN AT
 MY OWN UNIVERSITY THERE HAVE
 BEEN SUBSTANTIAL INCIDENTS OF
 BLACKFACE OVER THE YEARS, AND
 IN FACT, ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS
 WHO IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF
 BLACKFACE USED IT AS AN
 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT THE
 UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.
 SO IT IS NOT JUST HERE, IT IS
 EVERYWHERE.
 WE ARE FINDING PHOTOS IN A JUST
 ABOUT ALL OF THE COLLEGE
 YEARBOOKS.
 SO THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT
 PROBABLY IS GENERIC IN THE
 SOUTH, BUT RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS
 IS ON VIRGINIA, AND IT POINTS
 UP THE VERY DIFFICULT
 RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD AMONG THE
 RACES IN VIRGINIA, AND EVEN
 THOUGH WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS, WE
 HAVE PROBABLY MADE LESS PROGRESS
 THAN WE THINK.
 KATTY: OK, SO IF THE
 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RACES WERE
 NOT TRICKY ENOUGH, THIS STORY IS
 ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THE
 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENDERS AS
 WELL, BECAUSE THE NUMBER TWO
 DEMOCRAT, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN,
 HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF HARASSMENT.
 I WANT TO READ WHAT HIS ACCUSER,
 VANESSA TYSON, SAID, "WHAT
 STARTED AS CONSENSUAL KISSING
 QUICKLY TURNED INTO SEXUAL
 ASSAULT."
 SHOULD GOES ON TO -- SHE GOES ON
 TO GIVE A GRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF
 BEING FORCED TO PERFORM ORAL SEX
 ON JUSTIN FAIRFAX.
 HE DENIES IT AND SAID, "I TAKE
 THIS SITUATION SERIOUSLY AND
 CONTINUE TO BELIEVE DR. TYSON
 SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT,
 BUT I CANNOT AGREE WITH A
 DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS THAT IS
 SIMPLY NOT TRUE."
 WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE NUMBER TWO
 DEMOCRAT JUSTIN FAIRFAX?
 IN THE ERA OF ME TOO, LARRY, IN
 THE POST-BRETT KAVANAUGH PERIOD,
 WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE HIM?
 LARRY: IT LEAVES HIM IN DEEP
 TROUBLE AND DAMAGED FOR THE
 FUTURE, EVEN IF THIS CANNOT BE
 PROVEN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, AND
 IT PROBABLY CAN'T.
 THIS WAS 2004 AND THERE WERE NO
 TEMPORARY WITNESSES -- NO
 CONTEMPORARY WITNESSES OR
 CONTEMPORANEOUS TESTIMONY.
 ALTHOUGH THE SENIOR
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN OFFICEHOLDER IN
 VIRGINIA, CONGRESSMAN BOBBY
 SCOTT, TODAY HE SAID HE KNEW
 SOME OF IT WAS TRUE.
 HE HAD DATED THIS WOMAN A COUPLE
 OF YEARS AGO AND HAD HEARD THE
 ACCOUNT THEN.
 SO LESS THAN A WEEK AGO, THIS
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN NUMBER TWO IN
 VIRGINIA WAS ON THE VERGE OF
 TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE AS
 GOVERNOR.
 NOW HE IS GOING TO BE VERY LUCKY
 TO FINISH HIS TERM AS LIEUTENANT
 GOVERNOR, AND HIS FUTURE IS
 CLOUDY.
 JANE: LARRY SABATO FROM THE
 UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.
 A LOOK AT SOME OF THE DAY'S
 OTHER NEWS.
 THE UNITED NATIONS INQUIRY INTO
 THE MURDER  OF JOURNALIST
 JAMAL KHASHOGGI SAID HE WAS THE
 VICTIM OF A BRUTAL AND
 PREMEDITATED KILLING CARRIED OUT
 BY SAUDI ARABIAN STATE
 OFFICIALS.
 IT ACCUSES SAUDI ARABIA OF
 UNDERMINING EFFORTS TO
 INVESTIGATE THE MURDER WHICH
 TOOK PLACE IN THE SAUDI
 CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL.
 THE HEAD OF THE SOCIAL-MEDIA
 PLATFORM INSTAGRAM HAS PLEDGED
 TO REMOVE ALL GRAPHIC IMAGES OF
 SELF HARM.
 THE PROMISE MADE TO THE BBC
 COMES AFTER THE FATHER OF A
 14-YEAR-OLD BRITISH GIRL WHO
 TOOK HER OWN LIFE ASSERTED THAT
 INSTAGRAM HELPED KILL HIS
 DAUGHTER.
 THE HOSPITAL TREATING BRAZILIAN
 PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO SAYS HE
 IS SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA.
 MR. BOLSONARO NEARLY DIED AFTER
 BEING STABBED IN THE ABDOMEN
 DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
 CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR.
 HE HAS BEEN IN HOSPITAL FOR THE
 PAST 12 DAYS AFTER A SECOND
 ROUND OF SURGERY.
 IT IS NOT CLEAR WHEN HE WILL BE
 WELL ENOUGH TO BE DISCHARGED.
 BRAZIL SUFFERED ONE OF THE
 COUNTRY'S WORST-EVER
 ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS LAST
 MONTH WHEN A DAM AT A MINE
 COLLAPSED, FLOODING THE AREA
 WITH SLUDGE.
 NEARLY 150 ARE KNOWN TO HAVE
 DIED, WITH MANY MORE STILL
 MISSING.
 MUCH OF THE ATTENTION HAS
 FOCUSED ON THE MINE OWNERS, VALE
 , AND THE POOR SAFETY STANDARDS.
 BUT SOME BLAME THE POWERFUL
 MINING INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND
 INADEQUATE GOVERNMENT
 REGULATION.
 FOR THIS REPORT, THE BBC'S
 SCIENCE EDITOR DAVID SHUKMAN
 WENT TO A TOWN NOT FAR FROM THE
 DISASTER SCENE.
 DAVID: WE TRAVELED TO THE HEART
 OF BRAZIL'S IRON COUNTRY TO
 INVESTIGATE THE DARK SIDE OF THE
 MINES THAT THE INDUSTRY PREFERS
 TO KEEP HIDDEN.
 WE COME ACROSS A LURIDLY COLORED
 STREAM, A FIRST CLUE ABOUT THE
 POLLUTION CREATED IN THESE
 HILLS.
 SUDDENLY WE GET THIS RARE
 GLIMPSE OF ONE OF THE LARGEST
 MINING DUMPS IN BRAZIL.
 IT IS FULL OF THE SAME KIND OF
 SLUDGE THAT FLOODED OUT AND
 KILLED SO MANY PEOPLE, A
 BYPRODUCT THAT ACCUMULATES DAY
 AFTER DAY FROM A MASSIVE
 BUSINESS.
 THE REASON THESE PLACES EXIST IS
 WHEN YOU DIG OR OUT OF THE
 GROUND, YOU ONLY WANT A TINY
 FRACTION OF THE ROCK, THE METAL
 THAT YOU ARE AFTER -- IN THIS
 CASE, IRON.
 THE REST YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO
 GET RID OF, AND THE CHEAPEST WAY
 TO DO THAT IS TO BUILD PLACES
 LIKE THIS.
 THE PROBLEM IS THEY ARE NOT
 TEMPORARY.
 THEY ARE MEANT TO LAST FOREVER.
 THIS TOWERING STRUCTURE HOLDS
 THE SLUDGE BACK, A DAM MADE OF
 LAYERS OF MINING WASTE.
 THERE ARE NEARLY 800 OF THESE IN
 BRAZIL, AND MANY SAY THEY ARE
 FAR TOO WEAK.
 PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SHADOW OF
 THE BARRIER HAVE CREATED THIS
 COMPUTER SIMULATION OF HOW THEIR
 HOMES COULD BE OVERWHELMED.
 WHEN THE DAM DISINTEGRATED LAST
 MONTH, IT LEFT OF THEM MORE
 SCARED THAN EVER.
 I DON'T SLEEP ANYMORE SINCE
 WHAT HAPPENED.
 IT WAS A WARNING.
 IF THE SAME WERE TO HAPPEN HERE,
 IN THREE YEARS, LESS THAN THREE
 YEARS, TOMORROW, LATER, I DON'T
 KNOW.
 THE FEAR IS CONSTANT.
 DAVID: NO CAMERA, NO VIDEO, NO
 MONITORING.
 NOT FAR AWAY, CAMPAIGNERS LEAD
 ME TO ANOTHER SOURCE OF FEAR, AN
 OLD GOLD LINE THAT HAS BEEN
 -- AN OLD GOLD MINE THAT HAS
 BEEN ABANDONED.
 THE MACHINERY IS RUSTING.
 THERE ARE POOLS OF LIQUID.
 YOU GET ARSENIC AND CYANIDE WITH
 GOLD-MINING.
 IT IS MUCH MORE TOXIC THAN
 MINING IRON ORE, AND THE WASTE
 IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS.
 THE LAST OWNERS OF THE MINE LEFT
 A LEGACY THAT IS POISONOUS, A
 MOUNTAIN OF CONTAMINATED DUST
 AND ROCK, AND THE IMPACT OF ALL
 OF THIS BEING RELEASED WOULD
 BE DEVASTATING.
 WHAT IS TRULY SHOCKING ABOUT
 THIS PLACE IS THAT YOU HAVE THIS
 HUGE LOAD OF HIGHLY TOXIC WASTE
 HELD BACK BY A DAM I AM STANDING
 ON THAT LITERALLY NO ONE IS
 MAINTAINING.
 RIGHT BESIDE IT, THIS LAKE OF
 HIGHLY TOXIC LIQUID, ALSO HELD
 BACK BY A DAM NO ONE IS LOOKING
 AFTER.
 IF THE WHOLE LOT BREAKS, ALL OF
 THESE TOXINS COULD ENTER THE
 WATER SUPPLY FOR MILLIONS OF
 PEOPLE.
 THE MINE IS IN AN AREA THAT IS A
 VITAL SOURCE OF WATER.
 A MAJOR CITY DEPENDS ON IT.
 IF A VERY HEAVY RAIN FALLS,
 WHO IS GOING TO GUARANTEE THAT
 THIS DAM WON'T COLLAPSE?
 IT IS REALLY SERIOUS.
 DAVID: SO, DOWNSTREAM THERE IS A
 RISK OF THE WATER BECOMING
 TOXIC.
 THIS SCIENTIST SAYS THE BROKEN
 DAM HIGHLIGHTED WHAT COULD GO
 WRONG.
 I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
 WATER IN THIS PLACE FOR ALL THE
 PEOPLE.
 ALL THE CITIES AROUND THE MINE.
 DAVID: BACK AT THE GOLD MINE, A
 PITIFUL SIGHT, EMACIATED HORSES.
 LIKE THE DAM, IT SEEMS NO ONE
 CARES FOR THEM.
 THERE ARE IDEAS FOR MAKING THESE
 PLACES SAFE, BUT THERE ARE SO
 MANY OF THEM, WHICH MEANS MORE
 DISASTERS ARE WAITING TO HAPPEN.
 DAVID SHUKMAN, BBC NEWS, IN
 BRAZIL.
 JANE: YOU ARE WATCHING "BBC
 WORLD NEWS AMERICA."
 STILL TO COME ON TONIGHT'S
 PROGRAM, THE BRITISH PUBLIC HAS
 SPOKEN.
 THE NAME OF THE NEW MARS ROVER
 WILL HONOR SCIENTIST ROSALIND
 FRANKLIN.
 20,000 DEAD OR DYING BIRDS HAVE
 BEEN WASHED UP ON BEACHES ALONG
 THE DUTCH COAST.
 THEY ALL SHOWED SIGNS OF SEVERE
 STARVATION.
 SOME FEAR THERE WAS -- THAT IS
 STILL FOR MUCH OF LAST MONTH
 CAUSED THE DEATHS.
 SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN
 TRANSPORTING HAZARDOUS
 MATERIALS.
 A WARNING, YOU MAY FIND SOME OF
 THESE IMAGES DISTRESSING.
 REPORTER: THIS IS JUST ONE OF
 THOUSANDS WASHED UP ON THE
 BEACHES.
 THE MASSIVE DEATHS HERE ON THE
 DUTCH COAST HAVE BAFFLED
 SCIENTISTS WHO ARE PURSUING
 THREE MAIN LINES OF INQUIRY --
 THE BIRDS MAY HAVE EATEN PLASTIC
 , THEY COULD HAVE BEEN POISONED
 BY CARAVAN LEAKING INTO THE SEA,
 OR THAT HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS MAY
 HAVE SOAKED INTO THEIR FEATHERS
 FROM AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO
 HUNT AND INSULATE THEMSELVES
 FROM THE WATER.
 A BIOLOGIST AND SEABIRD
 SPECIALIST IS LEADING THE
 INVESTIGATION.
 YOUNG AND IN VERY BAD SHAPE.
 EVEN ON THE OUTSIDE IT IS REALLY
 SKINNY.
 REPORTER: THE BIRDS FEED MOSTLY
 ON FISH.
 THE SEA IS RICH IN BASS AND
 HERRING.
 FOOD SHORTAGES ARE UNLIKELY.
 BAD WEATHER MAY HAVE
 CONTRIBUTED, BUT THAT DOES NOT
 EXPLAIN WHY THE DEATHS ARE
 LIMITED TO THE NETHERLANDS AND'S
 POPULATION.
 -- AND THIS PREPARATION.
 IF IT IS INGESTED, IT SHOULD
 STILL BE IN THE STOMACH BECAUSE
 IT DOESN'T DIGEST.
 REPORTER: THE SCIENTISTS HOPE
 THAT MASS POSTMORTEMS ON THE
 BIRDS WILL REVEAL WHAT IS
 CAUSING THE DEATHS BEYOND ANY
 REASONABLE DOUBT.
 JANE: INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE IS
 MOUNTING ON NICOLAS MADURO AS
 THE CRISIS IN VENEZUELA
 CONTINUES.
 LEADERS FROM EUROPE AND LATIN
 AMERICA HAVE SAID IT IS CRUCIAL
 TO RESTORE DEMOCRACY AFTER
 DISPUTED ELECTIONS RESULTED IN
 JUAN GUAIDO DECLARING HIMSELF
 INTERIM PRESIDENT.
 AS THE POWER STRUGGLE PLAYS OUT
 THERE, IT IS CLEAR MANY ORDINARY
 VENEZUELANS ARE STRUGGLING TO
 GET BY.
 OUR CORRESPONDENT JAMES REYNOLDS
 TOOK A RIDE ON A BUS THROUGH THE
 CAPITAL, CARACAS, TO FIND OUT
 HOW THEY ARE TRYING TO COPE.

 JANE: JAMES REYNOLDS TALKING TO VENEZUELANS ON A BUS ABOUT THE
 CRISIS IN CARACAS.
 SHE WAS A PIONEER IN SCIENCE,
 AND THE NEW MARS ROVER WILL BEAR
 THE NAME OF ROSALIND FRANKLIN.
 OVER 30,000 PEOPLE ACROSS EUROPE
 TOOK PART IN THE NAMING
 COMPETITION, AND THE CHOSEN NAME
 WAS UNVEILED EARLIER TODAY.
 REBECCA MORELLE WAS THERE AND
 SHE SENT THIS REPORT.
 REBECCA: I AM HERE WHERE THIS
 PROTOTYPE ROVER HEADS BEEN PUT
 THROUGH ITS PACES.
 IT IS DESIGNED TO ROAM ACROSS
 THE ROCKET MARTIAN TERRAIN.
 THE MISSION IS NEARLY COMPLETE
 BUT ONE ELEMENT IS MISSING, AND
 ITS NAME HAS BEEN REVEALED.
 IT HAS BEEN NAMED TO DAVID --
 NAMED TO THE ROSALIND FRANKLIN
 ROVER.
 ROSALIND FRANKLIN, A GREAT
 BRITISH SCIENTIST WHO DID SO
 MUCH TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS TO
 HUMAN LIFE WITH THE DOUBLE
 HELIX, IT IS ONLY FITTING THAT
 THE MARS ROVER IS NAMED AFTER
 ROSALIND BECAUSE IT WILL BE
 SEARCHING FOR SIGNS OF PAST LIFE
 ON MARS.
 REBECCA: YOU GOT THE PUBLIC
 INVOLVED IN THE NAMING PROCESS.
 THE COMPETITION WAS OPEN UP
 TO THE PUBLIC, 36,000 ENTRIES
 HUGE RESPONSE.
 IT SHOWS THERE IS SO MUCH PUBLIC
 APPETITE FOR THESE EXPLORATION
 MISSIONS.
 REBECCA: IT REALLY IS A BIG
 MISSION FOR THE EUROPEAN SPACE
 AGENCY.
 WHY IS IT SO VITAL?
 IT IS A REALLY EXCITING
 MISSION.
 THIS ROVER IS GOING TO DRILL TWO
 METERS UNDER THE SURFACE OF
 MARS, AND THAT IS WHERE WE STAND
 THE BEST CHANCE OF DISCOVERING
 ORGANIC MOLECULES THAT COULD
 HAVE RESIDED ON MARS.
 IT GOES TO A SPECIAL LANDING
 SITE, WHERE THERE WAS ONCE A
 LIQUID OCEAN.
 WE KNOW THAT 3.7 BILLION YEARS
 AGO, EARTH AND MARS WERE
 SIMILAR.
 LIFE COULD HAVE EVOLVED ON MARS
 AS WELL.
 REBECCA: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A ROBOTIC
 MISSION HEADING TO MARS.
 THE REAL THING HAS BEEN
 ASSEMBLED AND SCIENTISTS ARE
 WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK.
 IT REALLY WILL BE A FITTING
 HONOR FOR THE WOMAN WHO TRULY
 WAS AN UNSUNG HERO OF SCIENCE TO
 HAVE THIS LEGACY THAT WILL NOW
 LIVE ON MARS.
