 WELCOME TOLIVE."
 ADAM SCHEFTER HERE, RYAN CLARK,
 LOUIS RIDDICK AND JOINING US IN
 A BIT HERE IN STUDIO, THE TOP
 WIDE RECEIVER IN THE DRAFT, OLE
 MISS' D.K. METCALF.
 A BIG SHOW BECAUSE THE NFL DRAFT
 EIGHT DAYS AWAY ALREADY.
 WE ARE GETTING CLOSER.
 WE HAVE TO HAVE THE KINGS ON,
 MEL KIPER JR., TODD McSHAY,
 THESE TWO EATING BREAKFAST
 TOGETHER.
 SEEM LIKE TO LIKE ONE ANOTHER.
 GOT A BETTER OMELET THAN I
 YOU HAVE TO BE SICK OF EACH
 OTHER.
 LET'S GET READY FOR NASHVILLE,
 RIGHT.
 THE CARDINALS HEAD THEIR PRESS
 CONFERENCE ON TUESDAY.
 HERE'S GENERAL MANAGER STEVE
 KEIM ON WHERE THE CARDS STAND
 WITH THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL
 PICK.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 WE ARE NOT DONE WITH THIS
 PROCESS.
 WE HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION ON
 THE FIRST OVERALL PICK, ALL
 RIGHT.
 SECONDLY, THERE ARE A NUMBER
 PLAYERS IN MY OPINION AND OUR
 SCOUTS OPINION AND COACHING
 STAFFS' OPINION THAT WARRANT
 BEING THE FIRST OVERALL
 SELECTION.
 HAVE WE RECEIVED CALLS ABOUT
 TRADING FOR THE FIRST PICK OR
 ANY OF OUR PLAYERS, THOSE ARE
 THE SORT OF THINGS I'M GOING TO
 KEEP PRIVATE AND IN-HOUSE.
 RECEIVED THE FIRST PICK AND
 HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU EXPECT TO
 RECEIVE?
 I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE
 DETAILS BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY
 BEEN SOME ATTENTION.
 YOU SAID --
 CONVERSATIONS ANY OF THEM
 CONVERSATIONS THAT GAVE YOU
 PAUSE?
 YEAH.
 ERE'S ALW"F
 I GET EXCITED.
 I LIKE TO DO DEALS, BUT AT THE
 SAME TIME I LIKE GOOD PLAYERS.
 I THINK AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO
 I MEANd■■NS■ YOU CAN'TN.
 PASS UP AND IT'S THE NEXT THREE
 DRAFTS OF SOME OF THESE TEAMS
 YOU WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER IT.
 WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PRESS
 CONFERENCE AND YOU GUYS THINK
 THAT THIS IS MISINFORMATION, I
 MEAN WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
 SPITTING IT OUT.
 THERE'S A LOT GOING AROUND.
 THE FACT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
 WE'RE DOING BUT EVERYBODY ELSE
 DOES IS CONCERNING.
 IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU
 HAVEN'T MADE UP YOUR MIND ON THE
 NUMBER ONE PICK SH.
 BECAUSE WE HAVE TIME.
 A YEAR AFTER DRAFTING JOSH■1
 WHY YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT
 DRAFTING A QUARTERBACK WAS?
 I NEVER SAID I WAS.
 ARE YOU NOT OPEN TO DRAFTING?
 I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
 LIKE HE'S UP ON THE STAND
 THERE.
 I THINK HE DID A FAIRLY GOOD JOB
 OF TAKING ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.
 I DON'T THINK HE ANSWERED ANY
 QUESTIONS.
 HE DIDN'T.
 THAT'S WHY HE DID A GOOD JOB.
 LOOK, THEY DON'T WANT TO GET
 THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE.
 THAT SAID, ADAM SCHEFTER, WHAT
 ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT WHAT DO
 YOU THINK THE CARDS WILL DO
 HERE?
 I THINK THEY LOVE QUINNEN
 WILLIAMS AND I THINK THEY LOVE
 NICK BOSA AND THEY WOULD BE
 HAPPY TAKING EITHER OF THOSE
 PLAYERS.
 BUT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO
 STICK BY WHAT KLIFF KINGSBURY
 SAID LAST FALL WHICH IS THAT IF
 HE HAD THE NUMBER ONE PICK IN
 THE DRAFT, WHICH HE DOES, THAT
 HE WOULD TAKE KYLOE■] MURRAY.
 WHICH I THINK WILL WIND UP BEING
 THE CASE IN THEGg END.
 NOWu7AGAIN, KRAY IS
 SOMEBODY THAT CAN RUN KLIFF
 KI OFFENSE AND KYLER
 MURRAY WOULD CREATE EXCITEMENT
 IN THE DESERT.
 SO■URRAY, E■$ú TEAMS CONSIDER H1
 GAMBLE, EVEN THOUGH SOME TEAMS
 DON'T HAVE A HIGH FIRST-ROUN■
 GRADE ON HI WOULD BE THE MOST
 LOGICAL PICKERE,xFá■ARDI HAVE D
 THIS OFFSEASON.
 DO I THINK THAT THEY WOULD LOVE
 TO TAKE WILLIAMS OR BOSA?
 I DO.
 DO I THINK IN THE END THEY'LLÇWE
 SENSE AND HAS BEEN THE SENSE AND
 CONTINUES TO BE THE SENSE AND
 WE'LL SEE WHAT ARIZONA DOES NEXT
 WEEK.
 AS THE GREAT WOULD SAY, THEY
 HAVE A LASER IN ON KYLER MURRAY
 RIGHT NOW.
 I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO BE
 DOING THAT ON DRAFT NIGHT.
 YOU GUYS, YOUR BODY LANGUAGE WAS
 TELLING DURING THIS.
 I JUST THINK BECAUSE THE
 THING IS, THE REASON WE HEAR
 ABOUT KYLER MURRAY SO MUCH IS
 BECAUSE WE IN THE MEDIA TALK
 ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME, WHETHER
 IT'S REPORTS OR WHETHER IT'S
 KLIFF KINGSBURY SAYING THINGS
 AND WE'RE TRYING TO READ INTO
 IT, THAT'S WHAT STARTED ALL OF
 THIS KYLER MURRAY HYPE.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BOSA AND
 WILLIAMS AND ALLEN AND THESE
 GUYS, THEY'RE PROBABLY BETTER
 POSITIONAL PLAYERS AT THEIR
 POSITION THAN KYLER MURRAY IS.
 BUT KYLER MURRAY IS A
 QUARTERBACK.
 WE ALL KNOW HOW THIS LEAGUE
 WORKS.
 YOU KNOW, GUYS GETTING THESE
 HUGE DEALS BECAUSE THEY PLAY THE
 QUARTERBACK POSITION.
 IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT POSITION
 IN FOOTBALL.
 IF KLIFF KINGSBURY STANDS ON THE
 TABLE AND■  ■■■y■EHE GM■0ELLS
 KEIM YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS MY
 GUY, THIS G■■p■■■hILL HELP ME W
 I AM TYING MYSELF TO KYLER
 MURRAY, THEN HE'S YOUR PICK.
 BUT IF THEY WANT TO GO IN THE
 SAFER SIDE AND THE DRAFT
 PROCESS, THEY MAY GO AHEAD AND
 PICK THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER THAT
 GIVES THEM A STARTER DAY ONE AND
 A PRODUCTIVE PLAYER FROM THAT
 STANDPOINT.
 I THINK CUP TEXT IS IMPORTANT
 WHEN LOOKING AT THIS PICK.
 WHEN YOU HAVE A NEW HEAD COACH
 GIVEN WHAT HIS TRACK RECORD HAS
 BEEN AND WHERE HE'S COME FROM TO
 GET TO WHERE HE'S GOTTEN WITH
 WHICH I'M SURE KLIFF IS SAYING
 HOW DID I FIND MYSELF TO BE THE
 HEAD COACH OF THE CARDINALS
 GIVEN WHERE MY CAREER WAS GOING
 BEFORE THIS HAPPENED, IF I'M HIM
 I'M SAYING I DON'T CARE WHAT
 YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST OR
 PICKED IN THE PAST, I DON'T CARE
 ABOUT JOSH OR ANYBODY, I WANT MY
 PEOPLE AND IF■a■a I BELIEVE THA
 KYLER MURRAY IS THE NUMBER ONE
 PICK IN THIS DRAFT AND I THINK
 HE WILL HELP ME GET THIS PROGRAM
 GOING AND GET US GOING IN THE
 RIGHT DIRECTION, THAT'S WHERE I
 WANT TO GO.
 IF YOU'RE STEVE KEIM YOU WOULD
 BE SMART TO DO THAT.
 YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT HIS PROFILE
 WAS WHEN YOU HIRED HIM AND
 UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WOULD NEED TO
 BE SUCCESSFUL AND YOU KNOW THAT
 QUARTERBACK COACHES/HEAD COACHES
 WANT THEIR GUYS.
 LOUIS.

 YOU KNOW THE FRONT OFFICE, IF
 YOU'RE STEVE KEIM, REMEMBER IN
 THE INTERVIEW PROCESS AFTER THEY
 GOT RID OF STEVE WILKS LAST YEAR
 AND SAID THEY MADE A MISTAKE.
 DO YOU THINK THIS WILL GIVE THAT
 LEEWAY AND LEVERAGE TO GET HIS
 GUY?
 YOU KNOW WHAT, QUITE HONESTLY
 I DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN ARIZONA
 SHOULD BE STICKING THEIR CHEST
 OUT BEING LIKE I GOT ALL THE
 ANSWERS AND I CAN FIGURE IT ALL
 OUT.
 THEY'VE PROVEN THEY CAN'T.
 YEAH.
 I'M SAYING THIS, IN THE WAY
 THAT YOU KIND OF LIKE MAKE THOSE
 DECISIONS WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE
 NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK AND NEW
 HEAD COACH, COMMON SENSE WILL
 TELL YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO FORCE
 ANYTHING ON A HEAD COACH THAT HE
 DOESN'T WANT, BUT AT THE SAME
 TIME AS A GM YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
 WHAT'S BEST FOR THE LONG-TERM
 FUTURE OF THE CARDINALS.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE LONG
 TERM IS FOR THIS REGIME, GIVEN
 THE TURMOIL THAT'S THAT IT'S
 UNDERGONE.
 IF THEY TAKE THE QUARTERBACK
 IT GIVES THEM THE BEST CHANCE
 FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS --
 AND MAYBE --
 THE QUARTERBACK COMES IN AND
 PLAYS WELL, THEY'RE SET FOR THE
 NEXT 12, 15 YEARS.
 OH, YEAH.
 AND IF KYLER MURRAY IS THE
 GUY, THEN THE INTERESTING
 QUESTION OF THIS DRAFT ISN'T WHO
 ARIZONA TAKES OR WANTS BUT WHAT
 DO THEY DO WITH JOSH --
 I WILL GO BACK TO SAYING
 THIS, WHEN KLIFF WAS INTRODUCED
 AND MICHAEL BIDWELL WAS TALKING
 AND WHY DID HE HIRE KLIFF KINGS
 BURY, HOW EXCITING THAT OFFENSE
 WAS AT TEXAS TECH AND WANTED
 SOME OF THAT ON HIS FOOTBALL
 TEAM.
 RIGHT.
 THERE YOU GO.
 I'M SURE YOU SAW --
 QUINNEN WILLIAMS FIRST
 OVERALL.
 RIGHT.
 I'M SURE YOU GUYS SAW, TOO,
 THAT HIS AGENT, ACCOMPANIED HIM
 OUT TO ARIZONA WHICH --
 STEVE KEIM -- HE WAS THERE IN
 ARIZONA.
 HE WASN'T IN THE FACILITY.
 NOT IN THE MEETINGS.
 YOU KNOW.
 HE WAS A PART OF IT.
 ALL RIGHT.
 LET'S GO TO MEL KIPER JR. AND
 TODD McSHAY HERE.
 YOU HEARD STEVE KEIM.
 THE CARDINALS HAVEN'T MADE UP
 THEIR MINDS AND A NUMBER OF
 PLAYERS, WHAT SCENARIOS COULD
 PLAY OUT AT THE TOP OF THE DRAFT
 ONE WEEK FROM TOMORROW?
 I STILL THINK THAT KYLER WILL
 BE THE GUY.
 IF YOU HIRE KLIFF AND WANT THE
 BEST POSSIBLE QUARTERBACK FOR
 HIS SYSTEM AND I THINK IT'S
 KYLER, AT NUMBER ONE.
 IF IT'S IN THE FOR SOME RUN,
 THEN YOU HAVE TO START TO LOOK
 AT THE PICTURE HERE.
 THE JETS DON'T HAVE A SECOND
 ROUND PICK.
 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THEYoOI
 FROM PICK THREE TO 68.
 THEY'RE ONE TEAM THAT MIGHT WANT
 TO MOVE OUT IF A TEAM IS LOOKING
 TO MOVE UP TO THAT SPOT TO GO
 GET KYLER IF HE'S AVAILABLE AT
 THREE.
 THE RATDSERS, I T■>ó>ó>■>■8■>■>
 THE DRAFT CAPITAL WITH FOUR, 24,
 27, 35, TO MOVE UP AND GO GET
 HIM I WANT TO.
 AGAIN I THINK THEY WOULD STAY
 HOME,ÑÑ■■■[■[■[■[■z?=■z■z■[■=■[
 THAT THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS
 ABOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP, BUT I
 THINK KYLER AT FOUR WOULD MAKE
 SENSE IF THAT'S THE ROUTE THAT
 JOHN WANTS TO GO.
 I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO
 PACKAGE A BUNCH OF PICKS TO GET
 HIM, MEL.
 YOU SAY ALL THIS NOW BECAUSE
 YOU WANT JOSH ROSEN TO HAVE
 VALUE AND TALKING UP THAT PICK
 LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
 DOING -- THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
 DOING.
 NO VALUE IN SAYING ANYTHING
 ELSE.
 THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.
 THEY KNOW THE QUARTERBACK
 THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH.
 THEY KNOW IT.
 WHETHER RIGHT AFTER THE DRAFT GO
 TO CONFESSION, YOU KNOW WHY, A
 LOT OF LIES THIS TIME OF YEAR.
 THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
 JOHN DORSEY KNEW HE WAS TAKING
 BAKER MAYFIELD TWO MONTHS BEFORE
 THE DRAFT, DIDN'T SAY IT AN HOUR
 BEFORE, BUT THEY KNOW.
 MURRAY GOES ONE, IT FLOWS THE
 WAY WE THINK.
 THE TALK ABOUT QUINNEN WILLIAMS
 AND JOSH ALLEN, NICK BOSA, GO BY
 THE BOARDS.
 THE RAIDERS I DON'T THINK AT
 FOUR ARE TRADING UP.
 IF HE FALLS MAYBE FINE.
 MAYBE MIAMI WOULD BE INTERESTING
 TO SEE IF THEY WOULD JUMP UP IF
 MURRAY DIDN'T GO ONE.
 THE DOLPHINS FEEL AT 13, TANKEN
 FOR TWO, I DON'T BUY THAT, GET
 THE QUARTERBACK THIS YEAR.
 SCENARIOS COULD UNFOLD IF MURRAY
 DOESN'T GO NUMBER ONE.
 WE THINK HE WILL.
 ALL THE ANSWERS RIGHT THERE.
 SCHEFTER IS WHISPERING OVER
 HERE LIKE CRITIQUING YOUR PICKS
 ALREADY.
 QUINNEN WILLIAMS, YOU GUYS,
 YOU MENTIONED HIM.
 HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE SHOW
 TOMORROW.
 TUNS OF QUESTIONS FOR HIM.
 BY THE WAY, IF THE CARDINALS
 DRAFT KYLER MURRAY HE WILL BE
 THE SECOND TEAM TO DRAFT A
 QUARTERBACK IN THE FIRST ROUND
 IN BACK-TO-BACK DRAFTS SINCE
 THE '82 AND '83 COLTS.
 STILL TO COME, WE'VE GOT A JAM
 PACKED D ON■ "NFL LIVE."■7■1
 OLE MISS WIDE RECEIVERD.J.
 METCALF IN STUDIO, WE WILL TALK
 TO HIM ABOUT THE DRAFT PROCESS
 AND WHERE HE THINKS HE WILL WIND
 UP GOING.

 D.K. MET CALF IS ONE OF THE MOST
 INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN THIS
 DRAFT.
 THE HEIGHT/WEIGHT/SPEED
 COMBINATION IS SOMETHING SCOUTS
 DROOL OVER.
 HIS FATHER WAS AN OFFENSIVE
 LINEMAN IN THE NFL.
 MY SON WAS BUILT, PRESSING 50

 HERE'S WATCHING WITH MY EYES
 HERE, QUITE INTIMIDATING.
 THE WIDE RECEIVER D.K. MET CALF,
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HANGING
 OUT WITH US.
 MY THOUGHT WAS, MAN, HE'S IN
 BRISTOL ALL DAY LONG DOING ALL
 THESE THINGS, FIGURE OUT A WAY
 TO MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AND
 DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE GYM
 BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO WORK
 OUT, I FOUND OUT YOU LIKE
 STRAWBERRY MILK, WHICH I FEEL
 LIKE IS AN EARLY 1980'S THING.
 TOO YOUNG TO LIKE STRAWBERRY
 MILK.
 WHY DO YOU LIKE THIS?
 STARTED MY FRESHMAN YEAR.
 I COULDN'T GO TO SLEEP SO I
 WOULD GO TO THE GAS STATION AND
 GET A BOTTLE OF STRAWBERRY MILK
 AND PUT ME RIGHT TO SLEEP.
 PREMADE OR POWDER.
 PREMADE.
 IS THIS PART OF YOUR DIET?
 I HAD TO TAKE IT OUT WHILE I
 WAS TRAINING.
 YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO SIP
 AFTER I GRILL YOU WITH THESE
 HARD QUESTIONS.
 JUST IN TERMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA A
 RIGHT, WE ALL KNOW THE PICTURES.
 WE'VE SEEN THEM ALL A MILLION
 TIMES.
 YOU WITH YOUR SHIRT OFF.
 IT'S BECOME YOUR IDENTITY OF HOW
 PEOPLE KNOW YOUR NAME, HOW IT
 GOT OUT THERE.
 WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO DO
 REACTION THE WORLD WHEN THEY SAW
 THAT PHOTO?
 WELL, ONE OF THE QUARTERBACKS
 AT OLE MISS WAS THE FIRST PERSON
 WHO LET ME KNOW LIKE DUDE, YOU
 ARE NOT THAT BIG.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
 I'VE BEEN THE SAME SIZE SINCE
 YOU LAST SAW ME.
 REALLY, PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE
 PICTURE AND LIKE BEING LIKE OH,
 MY GOD, HIS ARMS, LIKE I MEAN
 IT'S RIGHT NOW --
 YOU KNOW YOU'RE BIG.
 YOU DON'T POST A PICTURE IF YOU
 DON'T KNOW YOU LOOK BIG.
 DID YOU EXPECT IT TO GET AS MUCH
 ATTENTION AS IT'S GOTTEN IN THE
 PROCESS?
 NO.
 I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS BIG.
 I DON'T GET WHY PEOPLE ARE
 LIKE -- ALWAYS SAYING SOMETHING
 ABOUT IT IN THE MEMES AND ALL
 THAT.
 SEE, I'VE NOTICED YOU DON'T
 REALLY POST THAT MUCH ANYMORE OF
 YOU WITHOUT YOUR SHIRT, WHICH IS
 SUCH A WEIRD WAY TO GET INTO
 THIS, WHY DON'T YOU POST ABOUT
 IT?
 I FEEL LIKE I DON'T NEED TO
 SHOW OFF MY BODY.
 IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WANT
 TEAMS TO VIEW YOU, BECAUSE LOOK,
 IT'S FRONT OF MIND FOR FANS AND
 COACHES, MANAGERS, OR GENERAL
 MANAGERS THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
 KNOWN FOR, IF YOU WANTED THEM TO
 KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO BE KNOWN
 FOR WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
 MY GAME FILM.
 BEING PHYSICAL, GO DEEP WHENEVER
 I■■■ WANT TO, AND JUST GO OVER
 TOP OF THE DEFENDER.
 SPEAKING OF PHOTOS, YOUR FEL
 POSTED A PICTURE SAYING YOU TWO
 WOULD BE BIGGER THAN JARVIS
 LANDRY AND ODELL BECKHAM, JR.
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO ELITE
 WIDE RECEIVERS WHO ARE
 TEAMMATES.
 DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU
 GUYS COULD BE BETTER THAN THEM?
 I KNOW THE WORK A.J. PUTS IN
 SINCE WE GOT TO OLE MISS.
 IT WOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE TO ME.
 YOU KNOW MAKING COMPARISONS
 TO RECEIVERS LIKE THAT, I MEAN
 THAT'S PUTTING YOURSELF OUT
 THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING
 ABOUT REALLY GOOD GUYS.
 WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR SPECIFIC
 GAME THAT YOU THINK YOU COULD BE
 IN CONVERSATIONS WITH?
 PLAYERS LIKE ODELL BECKHAM, JR.?
 I TRY TO MODEL MY ROUTE
 RUNNING GAME AFTER THEM, BUT ONE
 PERSON I REALLY WATCH IS JULIO.7
 WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT JULIO?
 HE'S 6'3" AND CAN BREAK A
 ROUTE DOWN LIKE 5'10".
 WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE ROUTE TO
 RUN?
  GO.
 WHY IS THAT?n■a BY THE DEFEN
 SPEED.
 WE KNOW WE SHOWED A LITTLE
 BIT OF VIDEO OF YOUR FATHER
 THERE.
 HE PLAYED IN THE LEAGUE.
 WE KNOW AT H THEY'RE
 AT WORK WATCHING  BUT WHAT
 KIND OF GUIDANCE HAS HE GIVEN
 YOU THROUGH THIS PROCESS LEADING
 UP TO THE DRAFT?
 JUST ENJOY THE MOMENT AND
 CONTINUE TO WORK HARD.
 EVEN WHEN I GET THERE, JUST
 CONTINUE TO BE THE SAME PERSON
 WHO I AM.
 THE HARD-WORKING KID FROM
 MISSISSIPPI.
 THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
 HE KNOWS HOW HE RAISED ME AND HE
 RAISED ME REAL WELL.
 I THANK THEM■kók]k■k■k]kókók]kós
 JUST WORK HARD AND BE NICE TO
 PEOPLE.
 BE NICE TO PEOPLE.
 DO YOU FIND THAT DIFFICULT WHEN
 GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS?
 BECAUSE IT'S -- THE EXPERIENCE
 IS SO DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING
 ELSE YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH?
 IT'S KIND OF HARD.
 DO YOU EVER WANT TO YELL AT
 TODD McSHAY WHEN HE HAS YOU
 FALLING OR MEL KIPER JR. SAYING
 YOU AREN'T GOING TO GO IN THE
 FIRST FIVE PICKS, DO YOU WANT TO
 GO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT?
 I KNOW THEY'RE JUST DOING
 THEIR JOB.
 CAN'T BE MAD AT THEM.
 EVERS HAS THEIR OPINION OF WHERE
 I'M GOING TO GO OR LAND, BUT
 IT'S JUST THEIR OPINION.
 LOTS OF US SAW IN INDY AT THE
 COMBINE AFTER YOU RAN THE
 FASTEST 40 FOR YOUR WEIG
 WERE REALLY EMOTIONAL.
 WHAT MADE YOU SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT
 THAT MOMENT?
 I MISS MY FAMILY FIRST OFF
 AND THEN JUST ACCOMPLISHING LIKE
 SEEING ALL MY HARD WORK GETTING
 PAID OFF.
 IT WAS -- THEN MY MOM TOLD ME
 SHE WAS PROUD OF ME.
 THAT'S REALLY WHAT BROKE ME
 DOWN.
 YOU'RE EMOTIONAL RUNNING THE
 40, THE FASTEST ONE, SO WE
 UNDE■ YOU WERE
 EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.
 NOW HERE WE ARE, EIGHT DAYS AWAY
 FROM THE DRAFT.
 WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN
 YOU HEAR YOUR NAME CALLED?
 IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
 SPEND THAT DAY, THAT TIME WITH
 MY FAMILY, JUST BEING AROUND
 THEM, AND, YOU KNOW, JUST SEEING
 ALL MY HARD WORK PAY OFF WITH
 THEM WATCHING.
 ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE,
 THIS IS HARD, SOUNDS LIKE YOU
 HAVE A GREAT FAMILY, WHO IS THE
 ONE PERSON THAT WHEN YOUR NAME
 GETS CALLED YOU WANT TO MAKE
 SURE THEY KNOW YOU'RE SO
 GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING THEY DID
 FOR YOU?
 MY MOM.
 YOUR MOM.
 WHY?
 SHE RAISED ME.
 MY TWIN, MY DAD SAYS WE'RE JUST
 ALIKE, SO JUST TO SEE THE SMILE
 ON HER FACE WHEN MY NAME GETS
 CALLED IS GOING TO BE GREAT.
 THAT'S AN EARLY MOTHER'S DAY
 PRESENT YOU CAN GET MOM.
 THANK YOU.
 CONTINUE DRINKING.
 HANG ON.
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU THROUGH
 OUR "NFL LIVE" COMBINE COMING
 UP.
 YOU'RE JUST GETTING WARMED UP
 HERE.

 BUT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO
 EXPLAIN IT COMING UP NEXT.

 DOESN'T WANT THE BRONCOS TO DO
 SOMETHING.

 IN A DRAFT ROCKING WITH PLAY MAKERS, TEAMS IN NEED OF A
 QUARTERBACK ARE SEEKING A HIT
 MAKER.
 AND THESE THREE ARE MAKING
 EVERYONE LISTEN.
 THE NFL DRAFT BEGINS APRIL 25th
 ON ESPN AND ABC.■8■8■■%
  BACK HERE ON "NFL LIVE" ON
 THIS WEDNESDAY.
 VETERAN WIDE RECEIVER DAMARIOUS
 THOMAS HAS A NEW HOME IN NEW
 ENGLAND.
 BACK IN 2010 McGAHNEN WAS A HEAD
 COACH OF DENVER AND DRAFTED■v
 THOMAS.
 THE 31-YEAR-OLD ONCE PRODUCED
 FIVE CONSECUTIVE 1,000-YARD
 SEASONS.
 WILL HE MAKE THE PATRIOTS 53-MAN
 ROSTER?
 WE'VE SEEN THE PATRIOTS PICK UP
 VETERAN PLAYERS AND WHETHER THEY
 MAKE IT COME AUGUST, THAT SAID,
 HOW DID THIS COME TOGETHER?
 THIS IS A SITUATION I DON'T
 THINK HE HAD A LOT OF INTEREST
 OUT THERE.
 WHEN SITTING ON THE FREE AGENT
 MARKET IN MID-APRIL AND LOOKING
 FOR A HOME, THAT TELLS YOU THAT
 YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MARKET THAT
 INJURY.UGHT COMING OFF THE
 THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE.
 NEW ENGLAND IS IN A POSITION
 WHERE IT WAS LOOKING TO ADD
 OFFENSIVE HELP.
 IT NEEDS OFFENSIVE HELP.
 IT HAS LOST SO MUCH THE LAST
 COUPLE YEARS.
 BRANDIN COOKS, DANNY AMENDOLA,
 ROB GRONKOWSKI.
 WHO IS GOING TO COME IN AND
 REPLACE THEM RIGHT NOW?
 BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU NEED PEOPLE
 TO STEP IN AND DO THE JOB AND
 DEMARYIUS THOMAS AS YOU
 MENTIONED WAS DRAFTED BY JOSH
 McDANIELS AND NOW THE PATRIOTS
 OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
 IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD FOR
 DEMARIUS TO LEARN THE SYSTEM AND
 ASSUMING HE'S UP TO SPEED THEY
 BELIEVE HE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
 SOME OF THAT OFFENSE THIS
 SEASON.
 THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING, HOW
 DOES HE COME BACK OFF THIS
 INJURY.
 LOOK AT HIS PRODUCTION AT THE
 BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR WITH THE
 DENVER BRONCOS, IT WAS DOWN,
 CASE KEENUM WASN'T PLAYING A
 HIGH LEVEL OF QUARTERBACK AND HE
 GOES TO HOUSTON, HUGE FIRST GAME
 AGAINST THE DENVER BRONCOS, THEY
 TARGET HIM EARLY AND MAKE SURE
 HE GETS THE BA ANDADES AWAY■)■
 UNTIL THE INJURY.
 THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE TO NOT
 HAVING A HUGE MARKET FOR
 DEMARYIUS THOMAS.
 HE IS UBER TALENTED, A BIG BODY
 THAT CAN GET THE BALL.
 IF HE'S HEALTHY AND ABLE TO
 PRODUCE LATE IN THE SEASON THAT
 WILL BE WHAT THE NEW ENGLAND
 TS HAVE TO BE LOOKING FOR
 WHEN INTO THE PLAYOFF
 STRETCH, DOWN LATE FOOT SEASON,
 IN DECEMBER, EARLY JANUARY, CAN
 DEMARYIUS THOMAS BE A PIECE FOR
 THAT?
 I DON'T SEE HIM BEING A GUY WHO
 CONTRIBUTEHO IS R AT
 THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON.
 U THINK HE MAKES THIS
 ROSTER COME AUGUST?
 YOU KNOW ■■■■■■, I THINK AS
 LONG AS HIS HEALTH PLAYS OUT I
 THINK HE DOES.
 THIS IS CLASSIC TEAM BUILDING.
 THIS IS CLASSIC VALUE PLAY,
 CLASSIC VALUE SHOPPING, LOW
 RISK/HIGH REWARD, WHAT NEW
 ENGLAND DOES.
 WE'LL FIND A GUY WE KNOW CAN HIT
 THE GROUND RUNNING, NOT GOING TO
 LOSE A LOT FROM NOT BEING ON THE
 FOOTBALL FIELD BECAUSE HE HAS
 FAMILIARITY WITH OUR OFFENSIVE
 COORDINATOR FROM HIS TIME IN■v■
 DENVER.
 IT'S MATTER OF CAN WE GET HIM
 HEALTHY AND ON THE FIELD AND
 KEEP HIM ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
 BECAUSE WE DON'T -- WE'RE NOT
 LOOKING FOR HIM TO BE A GUY A
 FIVE, SIX, SEVEN-YEAR PLAYER,
 WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE AT
 OTHER POSITIONS OTHER THAN
 QUARTERBACK YOU HAVE BRIDGE
 PLAYERS, PLAYERS THAT BUY YOU
 TIME UNTIL YOU CAN KIND OF
 RESTOCK THE CUP BOARD.
 IT'S CLASSIC FOR NEW ENGLAND.
 MOST PEOPLE GO, DEMARYIUS
 THOMAS, GOING TO BE 32 YEARS
 OLD.
 FOR WHAT?
 FOR THEM THEY GO WE'LL TAKE THAT
 AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
 MAKES SENSE FOR THEM.
 LISTEN, $150,000 SIGNING
 BONUS.
 IF THEY'RE WRONG, SO WHAT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
 IF THEY'RE RIGHT, THEN THEY'RE
 THE PATRIOTS.
 AREN'T THEY ALWAYS RIGHT.
 THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
 WHEN IT COMES TO VETERAN
 PLAYER ACQUISITION, THEY KIND OF
 DO IT BETTER THAN ANYONE.
 THEY DO.
 THEY FOLLOW REALLY THE THINGS
 THAT LEAD YOU TO SUCCESS,
 FAMILIARITY WITH YOUR SYSTEM,
 FAMILIARITY WITH THE PLAYERS.
 HERE IT'S A MATTER OF HELP WHICH
 IS BIG BUT YOU'RE RIGHT $150,000
 GAMBLE.
 IT'S IRONIC, THEY CUT PLAYERS
 THAT ARE ABOUT TO BE TOO OLD,
 BUT THEN THEY BRING BACK OLDER
 PLAYERS AND MAKE IT WORK.
 USUALLY IT'S BECAUSE THOSE
 PLAYERS THAT THEY DO CUT, THEY
 KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM THAN ANYONE
 DOES OR GETTING TOO PRICEY, OR
 THEY THINK THAT THEY DESERVE
 MORE.
 THAT'S USUALLY THE HUGE
 THING, THEY'RE GETTING PRICEY
 AND IT'S NOT WORTH THAT PRICE
 FOR US.
 WORTH $150,000.
 THEY NEED HELP ON OFFENSE.
 THEY'RE NOT DONE YET.
 THEY NEED MORE HELP.
 BILL HAS A CLASSIC LINE,
 SOMETHING TO THIS EFFECT, WE
 DON'T PLAY ANY GAMES ANY■v■ ■nI
 SOON.
 LAST I CHECKED.
  SCHEDULE --
 IT'S COMING OUT TONIGHT ON
 ESPN 2 AT 8:00.
 LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR
 REDIXIONS HERE IN APRIL BEFORE
 THE DRAFT.
 I WANT TO PREDICT THE
 REDSKINS TWO 16-0 I WAS WRONG.
OU MENTION BRIDGE PLA IN
 TERMS OF WHAT THE PATRIOTS ARE
 DOING.
 YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF JOE FLACCO
 WILL BE A BRIDGE QUARTERBACK FOR
 THE TEAM.
 IF IT WAS UP TO JOE,■■■■■■■■■■■
 DOES NOT WANT THE DENVER BRONCOS
 TEAM TO DRAFT A QUARTERBACK.
 WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN
 BALTIMORE W■1f7 RAVENS.
 TAKE A LISTEN TO HIS THOUGHTS ON
 WHAT THE BRONCOS SHOULD BE
 DOING.
 I WANT TO GET THIS TEAM TO BE
 THE BEST IT IS WITH ME AT THE
 QUARTERBACK POSITION.
 OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE MOST --
 OF MOST IMPORTANCE TO DRAFT A
 QUARTERBACK, BUT IF WE DO,
 THAT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF MY
 CONTROL.
 I'M GOING TO GO OUT HERE AND
 COMPETE AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE
 TO COME OUT AND BE ON THE FIELD
 WITH ME EVERY DAY TOO.
 I'M READY FOR THAT.
 IF WE FEEL AS A TEAM AND
 ORGANIZATION WE CAN ADD VALUE
 WITH A TENTH PICK I'M ALL FOR
 GETTING A GUY THAT CAN ADD VALUE
 TO THE TEAM WITH ME AS THE
 UNDERSTOOD QUARTERBACK.
 I LIKE THE COMMENTS.
 THROWING OUT THERE, LIKE LOOK --
 LIKE A SCORNED LOVER.
 I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS ONE
 OF THE SITUATIONS WHERE WHEN
 PEOPLE START MOCKING DWAYNE
 HASKINS OR ANY OF THESE YOUNG
 QUARTERBACKS, IF I'M ONE OF
 THOSE QUARTERBACKS I'M GOING
 PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ME.
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 I AGREE.
 I'M TELLING YOU, THAT RIGHT
 THERE IS A SIGN THAT I'M NOT
 GOING TO GET MUCH HELP IN THE
 QUARTERBACK ROOM.
 IT'S GOING TO BE TENSE.
 WE HAVEN'T SAW HIM LAST YEAR
 PROVIDE --
 AS YOU KNOW --
 THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
 I AM NOT READY TO MENTOR.
 WE TALK ABOUT CONTEXT AND
 SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT TARE
 MADE FOR QUARTERBACKS TO
 SUCCESS, A QUARTERBACK WHO HAS
 NEVER CALLED PLAYS BEFORE, I'M
 GOING -- HEY, NO DISRESPECT TO
 DENVER, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S
 COMING NEXT.
 IF I'M A QUARTERBACK I DON'T
 WANT TO COME THERE.
 I DON'T.
 I LIKE JOE'S STYLE.
 WANTS HIS JOB.
 THE THING IS, THOUGH, WHEN
 YOU HAVE■ó■ f/■/■■■■■ ñEñE■ñ/WA
 UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T DESERVE TO
 BE THE ONLY QUARTERBACK THERE.
 YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PLAY
 HASN'T WARRANTED YOU THE RESPECT
 THAT YOU ARE OUR GUY.
 YOU HAVEN'T DONE THE THINGS IT
 TAKES TO BE THE UNQUESTIONED
 LEADER AND STARTER OF THIS TY
 ■■■■ DO ROOKIE.
 SO WHAT HE'S SAYING IS HEY,"
 GUYS, BUILD AROUND ME.
 I CAN DO IT.HE'S BASICALLY OUT
 MPAIGNING.
■■P;■  PROJECTING THIS.
 DON'T QUESTION --
 HE'S PLAYING --
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
 HE'S PLAYING THE GAME TO SAY
 OH, TO MAKE JO>; SAY MAYBE
 WE SHOULD BUILD AROUND HIM AND
 GET HIM A WEAPON AND ADD
 SOMETHINGENSE B HE
 DOESN'T WANT THE COMPETITION
 EVEN MORE THAN THAT, DOESN'T
 WANT TO HELP A YOUNG GUY TAKE
 HIS POSITION LIKE HE SAW LAST
 YEAR IN BALTIMORE.
 AND LET ME SAY THIS ALSO, YOU
 ARE NOW IN A DIVISION WITH
 PATRICK MAHOMES AND PHILIP
 RIVERS AND A RAIDER OFFENSE THAT
 ADDED BROWN AND WILLIAMS.
 AND QUARTERBACK --
 AND MAYBE A QUARTERBACK SOON.
 WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
 YEAH.
 THAT REMAINS TO BE
 DETERMINED.
 THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, IN A
 FAST, COMPETITIVE AFC WEST YOU
 PROBABLY NEED DEFENSIVE HELP AND
 THE STRENGTH OF THIS DRAFT IS ON
 THE DEFENSIVE SIDE AND THE
 DEFENSIVE LINE.
 SOME ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
 TO ME DENVER THINKS IT'S GOT A
 GOOD TEAM.
 DENVER THINKS IT CAN BE
 COMPETITIVE.
 TO ME DENVER THINKS IT'S GOING
 WITH ONE OF THE POSITIONAL
 PLAYERS TO HELP SHUT DOWN --
 THIS TEAM HAS TO SCORE POINTS
 AND PUT THE BALL IN THE AIR.
 PHILIP LINDSEY CAN'T DO
 EVERYTHING.
 THEY HAVE A YOUNG, UNPROVEN WIDE
 RECEIVER CORPS WITH ANOTHER GUY
 COMING OFF --
 COMING OFF OF --
 WHO THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTION
 ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE OF THE
 BALL.
 I'M NOT SAYING QUARTERBACK IS
 THE POSITION THAT WOULD HELP
 THEM ADD VALUE AND FIRE POWER TO
 THEIR TEAM IMMEDIATELY, BUT IT'S
 NOT JUST DEFENSE.
 YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO SCORE.
 HOW MANY TIMES DO THEY GET TO
 MISS ON THIS POSITION.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TEAM WITHOUT
 PEYTON MANNING FALLING INTO
 THEIR LAP --
 PLENTY OF TIMES IF YOU'RE
 JOHN ELWAY.
 THIS IS FOR JOHN.
 YOU CAN DO THAT.
 WHEN I THINK DENVER FOR
 WHATEVER REASON I THINK GARY
 KUBIAK, BUT GARY KUBIAK NOW IN
 PALESTINE MN AND KIRK COUSINS
 GETTING HELP THERE ON OFFENSE AS
 HE'S THE ASSISTANT HEAD COACH
 AND CONSULTING.
 KIRK COUSINS KNOWS HE HAS TO BE
 BETTER AND TWEETED ABOUT THE BIG
 PLAYBOOK HE'S STUDYING AND IT'S
 A THICK BOOK.
 TAKE A LISTEN TO HOW HE
 APPROACHES LEARNING THIS
 PLAYBOOK AND GETTING READY FOR
 THE SEASON.
 THE SAME WAY YOU EAT AN
 ELEPHANT ONE BITE AT A TIME,
 RIGHT.
 YOU JUST START ON PAGE 1 AND
 FLIP THE PAGE ONCE YOU FEEL YOU
 THROUGH AND GET YOUR WITH
 QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
 ST YEAR THIS WEEK I WASí ■■■■■
 BECARE ARE PARALLELS AND
 CARRYOVER FROM THE PREVIOUS
 YEARS OF OFFENSE, WITH THE ONE
 WE'RE IN NOW THIS YEAR, I DO
 THINK IT'S MUCH QUICKER SPITTING
 THE PLAYS OUT IN WEEK ONE OF THE
 OFFSEASON PROGRAM AND I THINK
 THAT'S GOT TO HELP LOOK, WHEN Y
 MUCH MONEY YOU DON'T EAT HAM
 BURRERS, YOU EAT ELEPHANT.
 SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE
 REALLY GAMEY.
 TASTES LIKE CHICKEN, LIKE
 EVERYTHING ELSE.
 JUST LISTEN TO KIRK AND KNOWING
 THAT HE NEEDS TO BE BETTER, HIS
 TEAM WANTS HIM TO PERFORM
 BETTER, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS
 IS GOING TO BE A BETTER SEASON
 FOR KIRK?
 I THINK KIRK IS KIRK.
 RIGHT.
 LIKE LAST SEASON WAS MUCH LIKE
 EVERY OTHER SEASON WE'VE EVER
 SEEN FROM KIRK COUSINS AND I
 EXPECT THIS SEASON TO BE MOR
 THE SAME.
 HE'S A GUY THAT'S GOING TO
 COMPLETE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF
 PASSES.
 HE'S A GUY WHO IS GOING TO
 PROTECT THE BALL FOR THE MOST
 PART.
 HE'S ALSO IS NOTf■
 GOIN BIG GAMES AGAINST
 OTHER TOP CALIBER QUARTERBACKS.
 WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR IN AND YEAR
 OUT WITH KIRK COUSINS.
  COUSINS WAS BOUGHT -- WAS
 BROUGHT TO MINNESOTA FOR ONE
 REASON AND ONE REASON O
 THEY THOUGHT HE WAS AN UPGRADE
 TO CASE KEENUM THAT WOULD GETÑ■
 THEM OVER THE HUMP INTO THE
 SUPER BOWL.
 WHEN THIS IS A TEAM THAT DOESN'T
 GET A CHANCE TO COMPETE IN THE
 TOURNAMENT.
 THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE OF KIRK
 COUSINS AND THAT DEFENSE
 STARTING TO FALTER DOWN THE
 STRETCH OF THE SEASON.
 KIRK IS GOING TO GODO WHAT HE'S
 DONE ALL THE TIME, HAVE TWO
 RECEIVERS ON THE OUTSIDE AND A
 TIGHT END THAT CAN REALLY MAKE
 PLAYS.
 WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT CAN HE
 MAKE THE BIG PLAYS LATE IN THE
 SEASON AGAINST OTHER TOP
 QUARTERBACKS.
 LET ME TELL YOU AN ADVANTAGE
 HE HAS THIS YEAR THAT HE DIDN'T
 HAVE LAST YEAR.
 LAST YEAR TONY SPO RAN NO PASSED
 AWAY.
 I THINK IT IMPACTED THAT TEAM,
 IMPACTED THEIR ENTIRE SEASON AND
 THIS YEAR THEY'VE GONE OUT AND
 HIRED GARY KUBIAK AND BROUGHT
 ALONG RICK DENISON AND THEY'RE
 GOING TO HAVE BETTER PLAY UP
 FRONT AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING
 TO DRAFT OFFENSIVE LINE HERE AND
 THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO SOLIDIFY
 THAT POSITION BETWEEN THE
 COACHING AND BETWEEN THE TALENT
 THEY HAVE.■@I THINWILL BE B@@
 FRONT.
 BECAUSE OF ALLT I BELIEVE
 KIRK COUSINS WILL BE BETTER THIS
 YEAR WITH A BETTER OFFENSIVE
 LINE AND A SECOND-YEAR IN THAT
 ORGANIZATION.
 AND THAT SPO RAN NO THING IS
 A REAL THING.
 THEY DENIED IT BECAUSE THEY WERE
 IN SEASON.
 POSTSEASON THE FIRST THING
 ALMOST EVERY POU
 THEY ALL SAID GO BACK TO AUGUST.
 WHEN WE LOST TONY IT CHANGED.
 THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING A NEW
 TYPE OF RUNNING GAME.
 A ZONE BLOCKING TEAM.
 HA RIGHT PROFILE PLAYERS
 UP FRONT.
 MOVING I BACKWARDS TO KIRK,
 KIRK IS NOT THE GUY WHO IS GOING
 TO WIN GAMES FOR YOU.
 HE'S GOING TO WIN GAMES BECAUSE
 OF THE STRONG MULTIPLES.
 HE'S PROVEN THAT.
 DO NOT THINK KIRK'S NUMBERS AND
 THINK HE IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER
 OF THE PEDIGREE OF AARON
 RODGERS, OR DREW BREES.
 HE'S NOT THAT GUY.
 JUST LOOK AT HIS NUMBERS AND
 MANY TIMES WHEN WE'RE NOT
 PLAYING GAMES AND WE LOOK AT
 NUMBERS, JUST LIKE --
 BEFORE HE WENT THERE.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 PEOPLE ARE LIKE IT'S HE'S
 A DIFFERENCE MAKER, TEN TIMES
 BETTER THAN CASE KEENUM AND MEAN
 ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD.
 HE'S NOT.
 BUT HE WAS PAID IN A WAY THAT HE
 WAS.
 YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF PACKAGING
 WAS SET THAT WITH HIM NOW, HE'S
 GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.
 HE'S THE DIFFERENCE HE BETWEEN
 BEATING THE EAGLES AND LOSING TO
 THE EAGLES IN THE NFC
 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
 THAT'S NOT A KNOCK AGAINST HIM.
 THAT'S WHO HE IS.
 THEY BETTER FIX THE OFFENSIVE
 LINE.
 THEY COULDN'T RUN THE BALL A
 LICK.
 THE DEFENSE NEEDS TO REMAIN
 STRONG AND MAYBE PLAY BETTER AND
 TURN THE BALL OVER AND GIVE HIM
 MORE SHOTS AND BE MORE BALANCED.
 A LOT OF TEAMS ARE HAVING TO WIN
 THIS WAY.
 KIRK IS NO DIFFERENT.
 HIS SALARY IS DIFFERENT THAT'S
 ALL.
 ANOTHER BITE AT THAT IN A FEW
 YEARS.
 THAT NUMBER GOES UP.
 YOU CAN'T REALLY GAUGE ON THAT.
 THAT'S --
 ONE BITE AT A TIME.
 THAT'S A MARK WE KNOW.
 STILL TO COME ON■■Q■H■ --
 BITE OF THE ELEPHANT.

 THAT'S WHY Y THE BIG GUY
 AROUND HERE.

 QUAR NAMES THAT CHANGED

    Verizon got us VIP tickets
         three feet away     from Justin Timberlake.
          And to say VIP      is an understatement,
         because I sawww        Justin Timberlake.
      So he literally looked          into the phone
      and started dancing--
  well, he was already dancing--
           locked eyes      and continued dancing.
  Every now and then, I'm like,     "Wait, did that happen?"
      I've got photos of it,          it must have.

 TRUST IS SOMETHING YOU CAN'T
 RUSH.
 THAT'S WHY YOU COME IN HERE AND
 YOU STAY.
 I DON'T TRY TO BE ANYTHING OTHER
 THAN MYSELF.
 I THINK GUYS RESPE THAT.
 WHEN THEY STEP IN THE HUDDLE
 WITH ME THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE
 ■ DIFFERENT IN THE LOCKER ROOM
 @■@■ILITY.
  GOAL IS TO BE WHO I AM ALL
 THE TIME.
 WE'RE HERE TO MAKE THINGS BETTE
 SUCCEED, BUT TO DO THAT YOU HAVE
 TO BUILD A FOUNDATION AND THAT'S
 TRUST.
 YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW
 THE GUYS AND BUILD THAT TRUST
 AND GROW FROM THERE.
 LET'S HOP INSIDE THE FILM
 ROOM BROUGHT TO YOU BY VERIZON.
 LOUIS AND RYAN.
 WE LISTED A LOT OF QUARTERBACKS
 THERE BUT IN TERMS OF LONG-TERM
 GAIN AND CONTRACT, NICK FOLES
 PROBABLY HAVING THE BEST
 SITUATION THERE.
 AND, YOU KNOW, WE TALK A LOT
 ABOUT HIM BEING REUNITED WITH
 FLIP, BUT DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK
 THEM BEING TOGETHER IN THIS
 OFFENSE IS GOING TO HELP FOLES?
 I THINK IT CAN'T HURT.
 THE FAMILIARITY WILL BE KEY WITH
 NICK.
 YOU SAW THE GRAPHIC ABOUT HOW HE
 WAS IN PHILADELPHIA WHEN WITH
 PEOPLE WHO HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH
 AND THEN THE CULTURE THAT MAKES
 HIM OR ALLOWS HIM TO BE WHO HE
 IS, VERSUS BEING SOMEWHERE WHERE
 HE'S NOT.
 THAT'S HUGE WITH HIM
 IS JLL■8   TWO @HE FOO■■FIEL TH@
 THINGS FROM NICK, THEY7■ ■ T OU
 HANDS QUICKLY AND INTO PLAY
 MAKERS AND THEY NEED HIM TO MAKE
 GREAT DECISIONS AND NOT THROW IT
 TO THE OTHER TEAM.
 THE GUY WHO HAS BEEN QUARTERBACK
 ON THIS TEAM DOESN'T DO A QUICK
 JOB OF KEEPING IT AWAY FROM THE
 OTHER TEAM.
 THAT'S THE THING FIRST AND
 FOREMOST ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD
 THAT NICK NEEDS TO BRING AND
 BRING A SENSE OF CALM TO THIS
 TEAM AND LEADERSHIP TO THIS TEAM
 THAT PEOPLE RESPECT AND THEN IF
 YOU KIND OF LIKE EXPAND IT OUT A
 LITTLE BIT, THE REST OF THE
 PEOPLE IN JACKSONVILLE'S ROSTER
 NEED LOOK, LET'S SLOW DOWN WITH
 THE INDIVIDUAL STUFF AND KIND OF
 TAKE A TOTAL TEAM APPROACH TO
 THIS KIND OF THING.
 THAT'S WHAT THIS KID BRINGS.
 THAT'S WHAT THIS YOUNG MAN
 BRINGS.
 THAT'S WHAT NICK'S VALUE IS.
 IF EVERYONE ELSE CAN FALL IN
 LINE WITH THAT, THIS IS A TEAM
 THAT WAS A COUPLE PLAYS AWAY
 FROM THE SUPER BOWL.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK THAT'S THE HUGE THING
 WITH NICK FOLES, HE GIVES YOU A
 LOT OF THE THINGS THAT BLAKE
 S DIDI ALSO THAT
 CONFIDENCE THAT NICK FOLES CAN
 <i>S WHEww■ THEY NEEDED TO BE</i>E■s
 DONE.
 THAT'S WHAT THIS TEAM WAS
 LOOKING AT G■#■W■W■W■W
 SEAS
  JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS THOUGHT
 THEYN THE CUSP OF BEING A
 SUPER BOWL
 CHAMPION A■% THEN THEY RE-SIGNE
 AND HE'S BASICALLY THREW THE
 GAMES AWAY, LITERALLY AND
 FIGURATIVELY.
 SO TO HAVE A GUY LIKE NICK FOLES
 WHO MAKES GOOD DECISIONS, YOU
 CAN BE CONFIDENT ABOUT AT THE
 QUARTERBACK POSITION IS HUGE FOR
 THIS TEAM THAT FEELS LIKE THEY
 HAVE PIECES OUTSIDE OF NICK
 FOLES TO COMPETE IN THE AFC.
 I WAS IN PHILLY YESTERDAY,
 SPORTS TALK RADIO, CALLERS
 SAYING THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE
 LET NICK FOLES GO AND HE SHOULD
 BE IN PHILADELPHIA.
 LEAVING QUITE THE MARK THERE IN
 PHILADELPHIA.
 THIS HAPPENED YESTERDAY AFTER úú
 THE SHOW.
 REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO
 TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR REACTION
 TO THE DEAL.
 DO YOU THINK RUSSELL WILSON
 DESERVED THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO
 PLAY IN SEAT UNTIL.
 DESERVE IS A SUBJECTIVE WORD.
 THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET DICTATES
 FOR A GUY WHO HAS PUT■=■7■7■>é;B
 HIS NUMBERSNG TO BE 2 BOW#p
 SURPASSED QUICKLY WHEN THE NEXT
 THE SALARY CAP IS RISING AND THE
 MONEY IS THERE.
 THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET IS.
 YOU CAN ARGUE THIS IS A RUN
 CENTRIC OFFENSE A'T
 DESERVE THIS, DOESN'T CARRY
 INFLUENCE ON THIS OFFENSE LIKE
 DREW DOES IN NEW ORLEANS OR
 WHATEVER.
                 <u>OT THE■ HERE.</u>
 WHAT'S YOUR NEXT BEST ALTERNATIVE OUTSIDE OF RUSSELL?

 I KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE
 TIME OF YEAR WHERE SCOUTING
 RIGHT NOW --
 YOUNG QUARTERBACK --
 WE CAN ALL IDENTIFY.
 COME ON, GIVE IT A BREAK.
 SEATTLE RIGHT NOW DID THE RIGHT
 THING AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE
 JUDICIOUS HOW THEY DIS PERCENT
 THE REST OF THE SALARY CAP.
 NOT EVERYBODY WILL BE ABLE TO
 GET PAID.
 LIKE EVERY TEAM THAT HAS A FRIZ
 QUARTERBACK NOT EVERYBODY CAN
 GET PAID.
 THAT MEANS WHERE THERE IS NO
 SALARY CAP, COACHING, SCOUTING,
 DEVELOPMENT, PUMP SOME MONEY
 INTO THAT AND MAKE SURE YOUR
 PROGRAM IS TIGHT AND STRONG AND
 CAN WITHSTAND PAYING A GUY LIKE
 THIS.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT LIFE
 IS LIKE WITHOUT HIM, I CAN TELL
 YOU THAT.
 THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS GOT BACK
 TO BEING THEM LATE IN THE SEASON
 WITH CARSON RUNNING T L1■@
 FOOTBALL, HAVIN■■ RUSSELL WILSO
 MAKE HUGE PLHE FIELD,
 TO LOCK IT.
 $ LOO■ AT WHAT THEY WERE
 DIFFERENT THAN WHAT&t[■#IT.
 RUSSELL WILSON WAS CARRYING THIS
 TEAM.
 THEY WERE BAD UP FRONT, COULDN'T
 RUN THE BALL, CONSTANTLY UNDER
 PRESSURE AND HE FOUND WAYS TO
 GET THOSE TEAMS AND THAT TEAM
 OUT BAD SITUATIONS WITH HIS
 PLAY.
 YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE
 NUMBERS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
 AARON RODGERS' NUMBERS AND HE'S
 NOT GOING TO THROW THE BALL
 AROUND THE FIELD LIKE WE'VE SEEN
 SOME OTHER TOP QUARTERBACKS DO,
 BUT FOR WHERE HE SITS ON THIS
 TEAM AND WHAT HE DOES AND WHERE
 THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT, HE
 DESERVED EVERY PENNY HE GOT.
 THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS AND MR.
 SNYDER UNDERSTOOD THAT AND
 THAT'S WHY HE GOT THIS DEAL.
 SEATTLE, WE GOT A DEAL.
 THAT'S WHAT HE SAID FROM HIS BED
 WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL -- SOUNDS SO
 WEIRD TO SAY ON TELEVISION BUT
 THAT'S WHAT HE POSTED ON HIS
 INSTAGRAM.
 WE SAW IT WITH HIM AND SIERRA
 CELEBRATING.
 ALL RIGHT, THAT'S COOL, BUT IT
 IS KIND OF WEIRD, VERY PERSONAL.
 WELL, HIS TEAMMATES, OF COURSE,
 THEY HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO DO
 THEIR BESTSSION OF WHAT
 RUSSELL WILSON POSTED.
 CHECK THIS OUT.
 HEY, SEATTLE, WE GOT A DEAL.
 GO HAWKS.
 HEY, SEATTLE, WE GOT A DEAL.
 GO HAWKS.
 THIS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT.
 RUSSELL WAS A COOL SPORT ABOUT
 IT.
 LOOK --
 JUST GOT 140.
 I WOULD BE A COOL SPORT TOO.
 IF I'M CIARA I'M MAD ABOUT
 THAT IMITATION.
 DO YOU SEE HER IN THAT LIGHTING
 AT NIGHT.
 SHE'S PERFECT.
 THAT'S WHY IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
 IT'S DJ --
 THAT'S GOOD STUFF.
 THE FACT THEY CAN GET ALONG LIKE
 THAT.
 I'M NOT SURE IF ALL QUARTERBACKS
 HAVE THAT GREAT OF HUMOR LIKE
 RUSSELL WILSON.
 CONGRATS TO HIM AND HIS
 FAMILY.
 STILL TO COME, D.K. METCALF
 BACK IN HERE, SOME OF THE HARD
 S HE MAY HAVE HEARD
 DURING TEAM INTERVIEWS AND WE
 WILL TAKE HIM THROUGH SOME OF
 HIS BEST PLAYS ON THE FIELD IN
 COLLEGE AND A LITTLE TODD McSHAY
 AND MEL KIPER JR.
 THAT IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
 THOUGH.
 I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.
 I DID IT DURING THE FANTASY

 FOR D.K.?
 THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS
 PEOPLE HAVE ASKED YOU ABOUT YOUR
 PERSONAL LIFE TO YOUR PEDIGREE
 AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO PLAYED IN
 THE PROS BEFORE YOU.
 I WOULD WANT TO ASK YOU, IS
 INJURIES.
 YOUR INJURY HISTORY.
 YOUR NECK INJURY, IS IT
 SOMETHING YOU FEEL AS THOUGH
 WILL AFFECT YOU GOING FORWARD AS
 FAR AS YOUR -- THE WAY YOU PLAY
 THE GAME AND APPROACH THE GAME?
 IS THERE ANY KIND OF RESERVATION
 DO YOU HAVE ABOUT IT AND DO YOU
 FEEL TOTALLY HEALTHY AT THIS
 POINT GOING FORWARD?
 YES, SIR MY INJURIES ARE
 FREAK INJURIES THAT COULD HAVE
 HAPPENED TO ANYBODY AT ANY TIME
 IN THE GAME.
 I GOT CLEARED TO PLAY FULL
 CONTACT ON JANUARY 21st.
 THIS IS ANOTHER THING PEOPLE
 WILL ASK YOU ABOUT AS FAR AS HOW
 YOU PLAY THE GAME ON THE
 FOOTBALL FIELD.
 YOU'RE A BIG WIDE RECEIVER NOW,
 ALMOST 230 POUNDS, 6'3", 6'4".
 AS FAR AS THE SIZE IS CONCERNED,
 I USED TO LOVE BEING IN THE
 WEIGHT ROOM AND PUMPING IRAN

 IRON LIKE YOU.
 THERE COMES A POINT YOU GET TOO
 BIG.
 IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'VE THOUGHT
 ABOUT PLAYING WIDE RECEIVER IN
 THE NFL.
 IT'S GOOD TO BE BIG AND STRONG
 AND RUN THIS WAY.
 YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN THIS
 WAY, CHANGE DIRECTIONS.
 IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GOT YOUR
 EYE ON TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT
 GETTING TOO BIG?
 NO, SIR.
 I'M GOOD.
 MY WORKOUT PLAN AND I'M A
 RECEIVER FIRST.
 I KNOW CHANGING DIRECTION IS NOT
 GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR ME.
 GOOD.
 THOSE ARE QUESTIONS I WOULD WANT
 TO KNOW.
 YEAH.
 I WAS NERVOUS DURING THAT WHOLE
 THING.
 IS IT NERVE-RACKING WHEN IN
 THESE INTERVIEWS?
 I'M USED TO THEM.
 YOU'RE USED TO THEM.
 COMES FROM A GREAT PEDIGREE.
 I WILL BE A SHAM CHAPERONE OR
 MAYBE YOUR AGENT.
 TAKE YOU THROUGH THESE STATIONS.
 COLLEGE FILM WITH TODD AND MEL.
 THEY STUDY THIS ALL YEAR-ROUND.
 THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT
 THEY SEE ON TAPE AND WE WANT TO
 GET YOUR REACTION TO IT.
 GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION
 FIRST.
 GO AHEAD.
 YOU SAY JULIO JONES IS YOUR
 GUY.
 RIGHT.
 WHAT AREAS OF YOUR GAME NEED
 TO IMPRO■■@■@@@■J GET TO THAT P
 ONCE YOU'RE IN THE NFL.
 GETTING IN AND OUT OF MY
 BREAKS ON SOME OF■@■@■@ROUTES.
 THAT POINT AND WORKING ON?
 RECEIVER DRILLS LIKE WHEN I
 CUT AND EXPLODE INSTEAD OF COAST
 OUT.
 LET'S FOCUS@g WHATO
 REALLY WELL, HIGH LEVEL, WATCH
 THIS PLAY HERE.
 THIS IS THE ONE SINGLE PLAY I'VE
 WATCHED ALL YEAR LONG.
 TAKE US THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE
 THINKING HERE?
 I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO TRY TO
 JAM ME WITH THE INSIDE ARM.
 AFS WAITING FOR THE JAM.
 WHEN HE THREW IT USED MY
 PHYSICALITY AND KNOCKED HIS ARM
 DOWN AND BEAT HIM WITH MY FEET.
 PERFECT.
 MPRESSED.
 ABIT, YEAH.
 LIKE EIGHT, NINE YARDS OF
 SEPARATION.
 SINCE I HAVE YOU HERE AND YOU
 DO STUDY SO MUCH FILM AND
 LOOKING AT SO MANY TOP
 RECEIVERS, WHAT'S THE PART OF
 HIS GAME THAT IS STANDING OUT
 THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE TEAMS ARE
 GOING, THIS IS OUR GUY.
 6'3", 228, LOW 4.3s.
 WE CAN WORK WITH IT.
 YEAH.
 THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO
 DOMINATE.
 THE RED ZONE.
 TOUCHDOWN, FIELD GOAL, BIG
 DIFFERENCE WHO WINS FOOTBALL
 GAMES.
 YOU HAVE TO BE THE GUY THE
 QUARTERBACK KNOWS AND
 COORDINATOR GOES I HAVE A
 NIGHTMARE MATCHUP FOR THE CORNER
 AND BEAT THAT GUY LIKE A DRUM
 AND GET THE TOUCHDOWN.
 KEEP WORKING GETTING OFF THE
 PRESS.
 THAT WAS AWESOME THERE.
 SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU
 WILL HAVE TO LEARN.
 YOU WILL LEARN OVER TIME.
 GETTING OFF THE PRESS IS GOING
 TO BE HUGE FOR YOU.
 ONCE YOU GET GOING THAT SPEED ■
 SPEAKING OF WHICH, COME ON,
 WITH WE'RE GOING, NEXT STATION.
 SO WE KNOW THAT YOU FAC LOT
 OF GREAT DEFENDERS, SEC, BEST■
 CONFERENCE IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
  DIFFERENT IN THE NF
GHT, RYAN■XRK?■■J SO --
  CAN EXPLAIN TO ■8■÷■8■8■8
 HE NEED TO BE READY FOR WHEN
 YOU'RE FACING GUYSTHE ■@■p■ ■p THING LIKE YOU ■á■■■ AND■>
 HAD THAT PLAY AGAINST SAVION. T THDB POSITION.
 ONE THING THEY WILL TRY TO DO
 CAUSE YOU'RE S■@■@ YOU
 T■ NG TO SHADE
 YOU TO THE OUTSIDE.
 SAVION WAS DOING■2■2■2■2 HE'S G
 TO SHADE YOU TO THE OUTSIDE.
 HE WANTS TO MAKE THE OUTSIDE
 RELEASE DIFFICULT FOR YOU.
 IF I MISS OUT HERE IT'S -- IF A
 GUY IS SHADING YOU HERE AND YOU
 HAVE A MANDATORY OUTSIDE RELEASE
 AT
  TO YOUR LANDMARK.
 SQUARE HIM UP.
 I GOT YOU.
 HEAD UP NOW.
 SQUARE HIM UP, GET MY ONE-TWO
 OR A SPEED RELEASE AND USE MY
 ARMS.
 SO I TRAINED WHITE AND
 JACKSON.
 THESE ARE SMALLER GUYS YOU KNOW
 FROM LSU PLAYING IN THOSE TIMES.
 I WOULD TELL THEM TO SOFT SHOE
 YOU A LITTLE BIT.
 YOU DON'T WANT THOSE GUYS HAND
 FIGHTING WITH YOU.
 IF THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE SPACE
 HERE TO CREATE SPACE AND TRY TO
 MAKE YOU GET OFF THE RELEASE ANO
 BE YOUR MOVE THEN?
 YOU TALK ABOUT GETTING IN AND
 OUT OF CUTS.
 THAT'S GOING TO BE A TIME WHERE
 YOU HAVE TO MAKE QUICK MOVEMENT
 LATERALLY.
 IF HE SOFT SHOES OFF YOU, WHAT'S
 EXT MOVE FOR HI
RYc■O GET HERE, RIGHT.
 CUSHION RIGHT THERE.
 HE SHOOTS THIS HAND.
 I'M GOING TO --
 GO HERE.
 I GOT YOU.
 THE FINAL THING FOR YOU WOULD BE
 OBVIOUSLY FINISHING ON THE BALL.
 I SEE THINGS/> AND TODD
 HAVE DONE.
 I SAW A PLAY AGAINST McFADDEN
 WHERE YOU HIGH POINT THE BALL.
 OBVIOUSLY THESE GUYS WILL TRY TO
 PLAY THROUGH YOUR HANDS AND BODY
 YOU.
 WHAT DO YOU DO TO SEPARATE AT
 THE BREAK-POINT TO MAKE SURE YOU
 HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO CREATE A
 GOOD THROW FOR YOUR QUARTERBACK?
 CHICKEN WING.
 WHAT'S A CHICKEN WING?
 THAT'S NOT A DEF TERM.
 TELL ME WHAT A CHICKEN WING IS.
 WHEN THEY GET CLOSE TO ME AND
 THE BALL IS COMING, LAST --
 GOING TO CHEAT?
 THAT'S NOT CHEATING.
 I NEVER GOT CALLED FOR IT.
 NOT CHEATING.
 IT'S ONLY CHEATING IF YOU GET
 CAUGHT.
 YOU KNOW, I NEVERHOUGHT I
 WOULD LIKE A GUY FROM OLE MISS
  YALL RIGHT.
  I LIKE TA
 CHICKEN WING.
 ALL RIGHT.VE NO TECHNIQUE F
 ANY COACHING TIPS, BUT I
 SOMETHING ABOUT GETTING INSIDE
 INFORMATION AND THIS GUY THAT
 YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET, ADAM
 GF IT,
 PROBABLY BLOW YOUR PHONE UP ALL
 SEASON LONG ASKING FOR
 INFORMATION.
 HE'S THE BEST AT WHAT HE DOES
 AND BEST AT KNOWING WHAT TEAMS
 ARE THINKING AND DOING.
 THE PULSE ON HIS VALUE RIGHT
 NOW, WHERE YOU THINK HE FALLS,
 WHAT CAN YOU SHARE?
 LOOK, THERE ARE SO MANY
 PLACES THAT CAN USE A GUY LIKE
 D.K. METCALF.
 THE QUESTION IS WHERE HE GOES IN
 THE FIRST ROUND, IF HE MAKES IT
 INTO THE FIRST ROUND.
 HE'S A FIRST ROUND TALENT.
 LOOK ACROSS THE BOARD, SO MANY
 TEAMS THAT NEED WIDE RECEIVER
 HELP.
 WOULDN'T PITTSBURGH MAKE SENSE.
 IMAGINE KANSAS CITY.
 IF THE CHIEFS WERE TO TAKE A GUY
 LIKE D.K. METCALF AND PUT HIM
 WITH PATRICK MAHOMES.
 ALSO THE CHANCE THAT MAYBE YOU
 SLIDE OUT OF THE FIRST ROUND, ■H
 TO FIGURE OUT DON'T MAKE IT IN
 THE FIRST ROUND, GO TO THE
 SECOND ROUND, A SHORTER
 CONTRACT, MAKE ALL THE TEAMS
 THAT PASSED ON YOU PAY FOR
 PASSING ON YOU.
 LOOK, THERE ARE SO MANY WIDE
 RECEIVER NEEDING TEAMS, HE'S ONE
 OF THE TOP IF NOT THE TOP WIDE
 RECEIVER ON THE BOARD, WE'LL SEE
  TDE TO DO WITH IT.
 WE KNOW MOST RECEIVERS
 ENTERING ARE WILLING TO PLAY
 WITH ANY QUARTERBACK, ANYONE
 THAT CAN THEM THE BALL.
 IN TERMS OF A SYSTEM FROM WHAT
 YOU KNOW FROM WATCHING, IS THERE
 A SYSTEM THAT YOU SEE UP HERE IN
 YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD BE -- THAT
 WOULD FIT ME REAL WELL?
 ADD■ MORE TEAMS THAN YEAH.
 I SEE THEM ALL.
 THAT IS A■#■#■# GOOD ANSWER.
 ALL RIGHT.
 GUYS, STILL TO COME ON■ "NFL
 LIVE," YOU DID PRETTY GOOD, BY .
  PASSED THE GMS HERE LIKE
 YOU.

 SOME OF THE BEST STUFF WE DO
 HERE.
 FAVORITE SHOW.
 IT'S GREAT.
 GETS YOU READY AND PUMPED AND
 KIND OF --
 NOT JUST BECAUSE KIPER'S ON
 IT.
 WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH KIPER THE
 LAST FEW WEEKS.
 THAT SAID, LOUIS, YOU HAVE SOME
 FAVORITES IN THIS DRAFT CLASS
 COMING UP HERE.
 YEAH.
 AND WE'RE CURIOUS WHAT YOUR
 PROJECTED TOP FIVE FAVORITE GUYS
 ARE.W DOME UP WITH THIS
 LIST OF W THEY'RE TOP
 FIVE FAVORITE.
 NOT THE TOP FIVE THAT I THINK
 WILL GO OFF THE BOARD.
 MY TOP FIVE FAVORITE GUYS IN
 TERMS OF SCHEME, VERSATILITY,
 HOW THEY PLAY THE GAME AND
 VE BEEN.
 WHEN PRODUCTIVE AT THE COLLEGE
 LEVEL AND HIGH-LEVEL
 COMPETITION, YOU'LL BE
 PRODUCTIVE IN THE PROS.
 NUMBER FIVE EXEMPLIFIES JUST
 THAT.
 ■■■k■y■y■■■y■÷ú, MICHIGAN IS ONF
 THE GUYS WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM
 COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER
 HIGH-PROFILE PLAYERS IN THE
 DRAFT, YOU'RE GOING HE'S NOT■■■
 THEIR CLASS.
 HE LINES UP OPPOSITE A GUY ON
 HIS OWN FOOTBALL TEAM NAMED
 RASHAN GARY, HE'S TWICE THE
 PLAYER PLAYS WITH A BETTER
 MOTOR, BETTE TECHNIQUE AND
 AWAREN?h AND■7 HE HAS SCHEMED
 DIVERSE.
 HE CAN PLAY IN A THREE FOUR OR
 FOUR THREE.
 HE IS A GUY THAT CAN RUSH OVER A
 GUARD IF YOU NEED HIM TO AND CAN
 BEAT OFFENSIVE GUARDS.
 I THINK IN THE PROS HIS GAME
 WILL TRANSLATE DESPITE HE'S NOT
 ONE OF THE HIGHLY TALKED ABOUT
 PLAYERS IN THE DRAFT.
 NUMBER FOUR,K ABOUT JOSH
 JACOBS HERE WHO IS ONE OF MY
 FAVORITE PLAYERS IN THE DRAFT
 BECAUSE AS A RUNNING BACK HE CAN
 RUN IN A Z SCHEME, IN A POWER
 SCHEME.
 HE CAN PASS PROTECT AND CATCH
 THE BALL OUT OF THE BACKFIELD
 AND BREAK THE HOME RUNS AND
 FIRST AND FOREMOST HE WILL
 ABSOLUTELY PUNISH YOU AND KNOCK
 YOUR TEETH OUT.
 THIS GUY ISo■■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Ñ■
 SO IN THE NFL, I T■ GAME )■TRANO
 GUYS AGREE?
 I DO.
 I'LL TELL YOU, HOW ABOUT THE
 PATRIOTS AND ROB NINKOVICH,
 REMEMBER HIM, COMING UP.
 BETTER ATHLETE THAN PEOPLE
 THINK.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT
 LIKE THIS IS A GUY THAT'S AN
 OVERACHIEVER.
 HE'S NOT.
 THE STEREOTYPE PEOPLE TRY TO
 ASSOCIATE WITH CHASE.
 THIS GUY IS JUST A FANTASTIC
 FOOTBALL PLAYER OVERALL.
 NUMBER THREE, IT'S KIND OF
 INTERESTING HERE, WHERE ARE YOU,
 BUDDY.
 NICK, THERE YOU GO.
 LOOK, MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY, NO
 KIDDING, THIS GUY IS A GOOD
 FOOTBALL PLAYER, PROBABLY GOING
 NUMBER ONE OR TWO OVERALL.
 THERE'S A REASON WHY I P■IM
 ON HERE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF
 WHERE PEOPLE PROJECT HIM.
 JUST BECAUSE OF HOW HE PLAYS THE
 GAME.
 AND HOW SCHEME DIVERSE HE IS AND
 o■ READY HE IS.■>
 HE CAN PLAY THE RUN.
 HE'S DISTINCTIVE AND NEEDS TO
 STAY HEALTHY AND PLAY IN A THREE
 FOUR OR FOUR THREE.
 WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SAY AS FAR
 AS HIS PROJECTION IS CONCERNED.
 NOT MUCH ELSE TO TALK ABOUT WITH
 A GUY LIKE NICK BOSA.
 NUMBER TWO.
 THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
 PLAYERS IN THE DRAFT, IT'S NOT
 YOU, KYLER, IT Iñ>■■■■Ñ■■■■■Ñ■Ñ
 WILKINS WHO ON CLEMSON'S DEFENSE
 I THINK HE IS THE GUY WHO STANDS
 OUT AS THE GUY WHO IS MOST
 CONSISTENT, AGAIN, A GUY WHO CAN
 PLAY THE RUN, THE PASS, PLAY THE
 ONE TECHNIQUE, THREETECHNIQUE,
 CHASES THEOOTBALL.
 YOU SEE 42 FLASHING ACROSS YOUR
 SCREEN EVERY SINGLE DEFENSIVE ■
 YOU LOOK AT HOW --
 SPECIAL TEAMS AND SOMETIMES
 THE GOAL LINE.
 HEY, EXACTLY.
 AS GOOD AS THIS KID HAS BEEN IN
 THE PROS, HIS GAME IS THE KIND
 OF GAME THAT TRANSFERS TO THE
 PRO GAME.
 AND THEN NUMBER ONE, LOOK --
 DYING TO SEE THIS.
 I AM JUST ENAMORED WITH DEVIN
 I PLAYED WITH HIS FATHER IN
 ATLANTA, DEVIN BUSH A SAFETY
 FROM@■■ FLORIDA STATE.
 THIS KID IS TWICE THE ATHLETE
 HIS DAD WAS AND HIS DAD WAS HELL
 ON WHEELS AS FAR AS
 HITT
 ■ O■  THE SPOT AS FAR ■>■■8■>■>
 BUCKLING THE HEADS OF OFFENSIVE
 LINEMEN THE WAY HE TAKES THEM
 ON.
 FAST AS YOU KNOW WHAT.
 HE CAN GET TO THE PERIMETER AND
 MAKE IMPACT PLAYS AGAINST THE
 RUN AND COVER.
 I LOVE DEVIN FROM LSU.
 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHITE AND
 BUSH.
 I'M TAKING THIS KID WITHIN
 THE TOP TEN BECAUSE OF THE WAY
 TEAMS PLAY OFFENSE RIGHT NOW,
 YOU BETTER■J■R■RUYS LIKE THIS
 HE'S GOING TO BE AN ALL PRO
 QUICKLY.
 FEW WEEKS AGO THAT DWAYNE
 HASKINS HAD HIS PRO DAY
 CALLED LOU THAT NIGHT, HOW GOOD
 IS HE?
 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD THIS
 GUY IS.
 HE'S SO GOOD.
 YOU DON'T HAVE HIM IN YOUR TOP
 FIVE OR A QUARTERBACK.
 I'LL TELL YOU THIS, LOOK, I
 LOVE DWYANE HASKINS I'M ALL-IN
 AND I COULD HAVE PUT HIM ON THIS
 LIST.
 ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THIS, THIS
 LIST RIGHT HERE, I THINK THESE
 GUYS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT
 WHAT I WOULD REALLY TERM AS
 TRANSCENDENT PLAYERS, I THINK
 THEY ARE TAYLOR MADE FOR THE
 NFL.
 DWYANE'S FUTURE SUCCESS WILL BE
 PENDENT ON WHERE HE'S DRAFTING
 AND COACHING HIM.
 ALTHOUGH I'M NOT DOWN ON HIM AT
 ALL.
 CODY FORD IS ANOTHER ONE MY
 FAVORITE PLAYERS IN THE DRAFT.
 THE GUY FROM OKLAHOMA.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 NOT A RIGHT TACKLE HE'S GOING
 TO BE A DARN GOOD OFFEN
 PRO BOWL OFFENSIVE LINE.
 AND MARQUESS --
 AS LONG AS HE STAYS HEALTHY.
 166 POUNDS, I GOT IT.
 TODAY'S NFL SPACE CREATING
 PLAYS.
 YEAH.
 VERTICALS, ASPECT, BEING ABLE
 TO DRIVE DEFENSES OFF.
 HE DOES EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR.
 ALL THESE GUYS.
 PRODUCTION.
 AND VERSATILITY.
 THERE YOU GO.
 WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT
 CHRISTIAN, HE'S A MAN.
 ALL■■■■ WILL COME INTO
 THE NFL AND HAVE THE IMMEDIATE
 IMPACT AND I THINK WIN KNOW
 VICH, SECOND ROUND PICK, DOESN'T
 MEAN -- HAS A CHAPS TO BE A HECK
 OF A PLAYER.
 DEVIN BUSH, I THINK RIGHT NOW, I
 WOULD MAKE A STRONG ARGUMENT
 HE'S A SIXTH OR SEVENTH BEST
 PLAYER IN THIS DRAFT AND COULD
 GO TOP TEN AFTER ALL IS SAID AND
 DONE.
 FOUR FIRSTS ON THIS LIST AND
 ONLY SECOND ROUND PICK I THINK
 MAYBE THIRD ROUND, SHOT TO DROP
 INTO THE THIRD, BUT WIN KNOW
 VICH, THAT NINKOVICH PRODUCTION.
 OVER RASHAN GARY IN THE

  YOU LIKE NICK BOSA'S TECHNIQUE AND HAND USE YOU WILL
 LOVE HIS TECHNIQUE AND HIS
 HAPPENED USE.
 B■■ THE SIZE OF■ E
 MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE THE PHYSICAL
 UPSIDE OF HIM --
 WHY IS -- ■HE
  IS HIS TECHNIQUE AND HAND
 USE SO GOOD AND THE OTHER GUY
 WHO HAS THE SAME COACH --
 RASHAN GARY.
 NEVER FIGURED IT OUT.
 THAT'S WHAT'S CONCERNING TO ME.
 VON MILLER I BELIEVE I READ
 WHERE HE SAID GUYS WHO RUSH THE
 PASSER AND PLAY GOOD IN THE
 COLLEGE FOOTBALL AGAINST GOOD
 COMPETITION GENERALLY ARE GOOD
 PLAYERS IN THE PROS.
 THESE GUYS ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD
 PLAYERS AGAINST GREAT
 COMPETITION.
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE GREAT PROS.
 A LOT OF GUYS THESE GUYS ARE
 GOING UP AGAINST WILL HAVE
 ANOTHERUPATION.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 THE GUYS IN THE NFL ARE THE
 BEST IN THE WORLD.
 YOU CAN'T GO AGAINST GUYS
 PLAYING AND DOING SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 YEAH.
 ONCE THEIR COLLEGE CAREER IS
 OVER HOW WILL YOU DO IT AGAINST
 THE BEST IN THE WORLD.
 YOU PEOPLE AT HOME TWEET
 SAYING ALL WE DO IS TALK ABOUT

 SATISFIED WITH DOING THAT.
 20 YEARS AGO, GUYS, MIKE
 DITKA THEY TRADE AWAY EIGHT
 DRAFT PICKS TO MOVE UP TO FIFTH
 OVERALL TO TAKE RUNNING BACK
 RICKY WILLIAMS.
 LOOK AT ALL THOSE PICKS.
 WILLIAMS ENTERED AFTER RUSHING
 OVER 2,000 YARDS AND WON THE '98
 HEISMAN TROPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY
 OF TEXAS.
 GUYS, HOW ABOUT PROBABLY THE
 BEST COVER IN ESPN MAGAZINE
 HISTORY, ONE OF THE TOP ONES.
 DITKA, WILLIAMS, ON THE COVER.
 THE PICTURE WORTH A THOUSAND
 WORDS.
 I WAS DOING RESEARCH ON IT,
 WILLIAMS ACTUALLY IS THE ONE WHO
 CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO WEAR
 THE WEDDING DRESS.
 IT WASN'T OUR COMPANY.
 HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FITTING
 BECAUSE IT WAS A MARRIAGE■  THA
 ENDED --
 QUICKLY.
 ENDED --
 QUICKLY.
 SO SCHEFTER, I KNOW YOU WERE
 OUT IN DENVER AT THE TIME
 COVERING THE BRONCOS WHEN THIS
 WENT DOWN.
 A YOUNG BUCK.
 WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?
 THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT
 STAND OUT.
 I REMEMBER IN A DRAFT BEFORE
 THEN, DAN REEVES SAYING HE WOULD
 BE WILLING TO TRADE HIS ENTIRE
 DRAFT FOR STEVE COMING OUT OF
 THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AT
 THAT TIME.
 EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU GET A
 PLAYER LIKE RICKY WHO A TEAM IS
 GOING TO TRADE ALL THE PICKS
 FOR.
 THIS TRADE, THE SAINTS■ttq4■ññ■.
 THE REDSKINS PARLAYED THAT INTO
 CHAMP BAILEY AMONGST OTHER
 PLAYERS BUT THE REDSKINS SHOULD
 HAVE BEEN SET UP TO WIN SUPER
 BOWLS FOR PICKS LIKE THAT.
 THERE ARE TEAMS TODAY THAT WOULD
 KILL TO HAVE A BOUNTY OF PICKS
 LIKE THAT.
 THE ONLY WAY TEAMS TODAY, THE
 ONLY WAY AODAY WOULD
 TRADE ALL THOSE PICKS IN MY MIND
 WOULD BE FOR A QUARTERBACK.
 THAT'S IT.
 BUT BACK THEN, IT WAS A HUGE
 TRADE AND I MEAN■8 STILL
 REMEMBER THAT.
 BIG ONES LIKE THAT.
 ABOUT AS BIG A TRADE OTHER THAN
 THE HERSCHEL WALKER TRADE WE'VE
 SEEN.
 I WAS A 19-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE
 STUDENT AT THE TIME IN LOUISIANA
 AND IT WAS JUST NUTS.
 IT WAS CRAZY BECAUSE YOU HAD
 SPECTRUM, PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPER
 EXCITED THAT WE HAD GOT RICKY
 WILLIAMS, A HEISMAN TROPHY
 WINNER, AND PEOPLE ON THE OTHER
 SIDE, ONE, THINKINGD■■
 Y STUPID AND TWO THE■■
  THAT ENSUED AFTERWARDS,
 MIKE DITKA COMING IN WITH■qr
 ■=■= ESPN ■/jCOVER.
 IT BECAME SOMETHING THAT WAS
 EMBARRASS PG.
 IT WAS A FIASCO.
 FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE A PART OF IT
 OR CLOSE TO IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE I
 WAS BEING IN THAT STATE, IT WAS
 A VERY, VERY WEIRD TIME TO
 FIGURE OUT HOW PEOPLE FELT ABOUT
 THE DECISION THAT MIKE DITKA AND
 THE SAINTS MADE TO GET RICKY
 WILLIAMS.
 MY CAREER WAS JUST ENDING AT
 THAT TIME ON MY WAY OUT OF THE
 NFL AND I REMEMBER JUST LOOKING
 AT THE DRAFT AND SITTING THERE
 THINKING YOU GAVE UP YOUR ENTIRE
 DRAFT FOR ONE PLAYER?
 THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN
 TODAY'S GAME.
 I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS A
 QUARTERBACK OR NOT, NOT WITH THE
 WAY GENERAL MANAGERS VALUE PICKS
 AND DRAFT CURRENCY.
 ALL THOSE PICKS.
 IT WAS -- NO ONE WOULD DO THAT
 NOW.
 THE LAST TIME I SAW THAT MANY
 WAS RG3.
 I HAVE A QUESTION.
 DO YOU THINK A TEAM WOULD GIVE
 UP ITS WHOLE DRAFT SAY AARON
 RODGERS IN HIS PRIME?
 IF YOU WERE WILLING TO TRADE
 HIM --
 IF YOU KNEW --
 IN HIS PRIME.
 TALKING ABOUT --
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT --
 AARON FOUR YEARS AGO.
 A VETERAN QUARTERBACK --
 WITH THEY DO SOMETHING
 LIKE --
 AARON FOUR YEARS AGO --
 I DON'T KNOW MAN.
 IT'S HARD.
 THAT'S A LOT.
 I MEAN YOUR ENTIRE DRAFT
 PLUS PICKS IN THE FOLLOWING
 DRAFT.
 THAT'S A LOT.
 THAT'S HOW --
 THAT'S HOW CRAZY IT IS.
 PEOPLE WOULDN'T DO THAT FOR
 PRIME AARON RODGERS, AND THE
 SAINTS DID THAT FOR RICKY
 WILLIAMS.
 EXACTLY.
 THAT'S HOW CRAZY THAT IS.
 IT IS.
 I WAS THINKING BACK TO LAST
 YEAR WE ALL WOULD AGREE THAT
 SAQUON WAS ABOUT AS HIGH A RATED
 RUNNING BACK.
 WOULD ANY TEAM EVER --
 NO.
 NO WAY.
 NO CHANCE.
 NOT THAT POSITION.
 MOST JUST MOVE UP AND GET
 HIM.
 NOT FOR THAT POSITION IN
 PARTICULAR.
 ARGUING THE GIANTS SHOULDN'T
 HAVE DRAFTED HIM --
 THIS TRADE EVEN --
 THAT'S --
 IT'S BIZARRE.
 WE CAN ALL AGREE THERE IS NOT
 A PLAYER IN THIS DRAFT RIGHT
 NOW.
 NO.
 THAT WOULD BE -- ALL RIGHT.
 HOW ABOUT WOULD THERE BE A
 PLAYER WHO --
 ACTUALLY --
 IF I COULD GET ADAM SCHEFTER
 I WOULD DO IT.
 I THINK SOMEBODY WOULD BE
 WILLING TO GIVE THAT UP FOR --
 WHO.
 TREVOR WILLIAMS.
 THE CLEMSON QUARTERBACK.
 TREVOR LAWRENCE.
 AN ENTIRE DRAFT PLUS
 TWO PICKS IN THE FOLLOWING
 DRAFT.
 THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
 PREDICTING.
 TREVOR LAWRENCE.
 SOMEBODY WOULD BE WILLING TO
 GIVE THAT FOR TREVOR LAWRENCE.
 I'M GLAD YOU CORRECTED IT.
 WHY DON'T I KNOW THAT
 QUARTERBACK.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 I HAVE TO STUDY.
 NEVER HEARD OF TREVOR
 WILLIAMS.
 THAT'S THE NEW GUY.
 UP AND COMING.
 TREVOR LAWRENCE.

            When your       flight gets in late,
          it's never too         early for coffee.
           Oh no no no.
           Your new boss            seems cool,
         but she might not        be sweatpants cool.
            Who is THAT         ready THIS early?
          It's only 7 am.
         Somebody help me.
            Close call.

 LOT ON THE LINE.

 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE OFFSIDE
 PENALTY, MAYBE BETWEEN ONE TEAM
