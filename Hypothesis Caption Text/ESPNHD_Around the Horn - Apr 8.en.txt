 TONY: TEXAS TECH-VIRGINIA.
 DON'T GET SO DEFENSIVE.
 REALLY, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET
 THIS ONE OUT OF THE THE 40'S.
 ALSO, BAYLOR AND NOTRE DAME,2 X
 PUIG VERSUS THE PIRATES.
 AUSTIN HUFF, WELL DONE.
 HANG THAT AT THE LOUVRE.
 1940'S WITH THE BASKETBALL
 GAME?
 IT BECAME ART.
 TONY: WHETHER DEFENSE SPARKS
 JOY IN YOU, WHETHER IT IS FIRST
 TO 50 WINS, WE WILL BREAK DOWN
 VIRGINIA-TEXAS TECH IN A&=
 NT.
 BE THAT, WHO DOOU■X FEEL
 GUILTY THINKING ABOUT AUBURN
 FANS THINKING THEY WON.
 HOW THE DOUBLE DRIBBLE WASN'T
 CALLED, HOW THE FOUL WAS, HOW■z
 THE NCAA SAYS THEY GOT IT RIGHT
 WITH THE FOUL, AND THEY D
 LOOK ATI@ NON-CALLS.
 WE ARE GOING TOTART WITH YOU■■■
 ISRAEL:■ BY LETTER OF THE  E E
 OPINION, YES, THEY GOT ROBBED.
 THAT WAS A DOUBLE DRIBBLE, AND
 ANY HIGH QUALITY REF SHOULD BE
 ABLE TO SEE IT.
 ONE OF THE REFS WALKING
 TRAILING THE PLAY AND SAW IT
 HAPPEN IN FRONT OF HIM, BUT IT
 IS SOMEONE ONE OF THOSE
 SITUATIONS YOU ARE NOT
 EXPECTING SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.
 DID THEY GET ROBBED?
 I HAVE SEEN A LOT WORSE.
 THAT FOUL CALL WAS ABSOLUTELY A
 FOUL.
 HE BUMPED THE GUY IN THE AIR.
 DOESN'T MATTER WHAT LEAGUE YOU
 ARE PLAYING IN.
 THAT IS GOING TO BE A FOUL.
 I UNDERSTAND THE REASONING FOR
 THE THING.
 I AM NOT A FAN OF IT.
 WHEN I THINK OF THIS GAME AND
 HISTORY I DO NOT THINK OF
 AUBURN GETTING ROBBED.
 I THOUGHT THE FOUL AND THE
 DOUBLE DRIBBLE IS SOMETHING
 THAT CAN BE.
 TONY:
 TONY: KEVIN BLACKISTONE, CAN
 AUBURN GET ROBBED?
 KEVIN: NO, IT DIDN'T GET
 ROBBED.
 THE OTHER THING WASN'T
 MENTIONED WAS THE FACT THAT
 JARED HARDY WENT TO THE LINE
 AND ONLY HIT 1-2.
 HE -- ANOTHER GUY HIT ALL
 THREE.
 A GRAB ON THE JERSEY THAT WAS
 NOT CALLED A FOUL.
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
 DISCUSSION ABOUT CALLING FOULS
 IN THE LAST CRITICAL SECONDS OF
 A GAME.
 WHAT ARE REFEREES OUT THERE TO
 DO?
 IF THIS IS OUR CONCERN, FOR THE
 LAST 60 SECONDS TAKE THE REFS
 OFF THE FLOOR AND LET EVERYBODY
 ON THE FLOOR CALL THE GAME
 THEMSELVES.
 THE CALL IN THE CORNER ON THE
 CORNER WAS ABSOLUTELY A FOUL.
 TONY: MINA KIMES?
 MINA: I THINK THEY GOT ROBBED.
 THAT WAS A FOUL.
 THE DOUBLE DRIBBLE WAS A
 MISTAKE.
 BUT IF YOU SLOW IT DOWN AND
 RE-LIT GATE EVERYTHING THAT
 HAPPENS, THE AUBURN DEFENDER
 DID GET A PEELS OF THE JERSEY
 BEFORE THE DOUBLE DRIBBLE
 HAPPENED.
 WE CAN KEEP DOING THAT OVER AND
 OVER.
 I DO OBJECT THE NCAA COMING OUT
 AND DEFENDING THE LAST CALL BUT
 NOT THE DOUBLE DRIBBLE.
 I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF
 THEY ADMITTED THEY MADE A
 MISTAKE.
 I LIKE IT.ONLY.
 GO LOU AND ORDER ON THE SHOW.
 WOODY PAIGE, WHAT ABOUT ABOUT
 YOU?
 WOODY: LET ME TAKE YOU BACK IN
 TIME.
 AFTER HARPER MISSES THE
 FREE-THROW, THEY HAVE A FOUL TO
 GIVE RIGHT THERE.
 WHAT DO THEY DO?
 THEY FOUL HIM AT THE FREE-THROW
 LINE.
 5.4 SECONDS REMAIN.
 AT LEAST LET HIM GO TO MID
 COURT OR OVER.
 THEN FOUL HIM.
 YOU HAVE USED UP MOST OF THE
 CLOCK AND YOU STILL HAVE
 ANOTHER FOUL TO GIVE AND NONE
 OF THAT HAPPENS.
 AUBURN WAS NOT ROBBED.
 AUBURN ROBBED ITSELF OF A
 CHANCE TO WIN THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP AND DIDN'T DO IT.
 THAT IS EITHER BRUCE PEARL'S
 FAULT FOR NOT SIGNALING TO THEM
 OR THEIR FAULT FOR NOT WAITING
 UNTIL THE CLOCK ATE AWAY.
 TONY: THAT IS GOOD ADVICE,
 WOODY PAIGE.TONY BENNETT, I DO
 AUBURN, BUT I DO FEEL BETTER
 FOR ALSO.
 KIND OF SAVAGE.
 KYLE GUY HITTING THOSE
 FREE-THROWS.
 HERE IS A QUESTION.
 IS IT FAIR OR FOUL TO WISH FOR
 YOUR OPPONENT TO CHOKE?
 THAT IMAGE OF BRYCE BROWN GOING
 TO THE NECK WAS OUT THERE
 IMMEDIATELY.
 MINA: IT IS FAIR TO PITCH FOR
 IT BUT FOUL TO DO THE CHOKING
 HAND MOTION.
 TONY YOU JUST DID IT.
 ARE YOU WISHING THAT UPON YOUR
 OPPONENT HERE?
 WOODY PAIGE, FAIR OR FALL TO GO
 TO THAT?
 WOODY: I THOUGHT AUBURN HANDLED
 IT WELL AFTER THE GAME.
 BUT THIS THAT SITUATION, NO,
 THAT IS UNCALLED FOR.
 WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
 MAKING A CALL OR NOT MAKING A
 CALL.
 HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.
 TONY IT IS CLEAR YOU DON'T WANT
 YOUR OPPONENTS TO HIT THE
 FREE-THROWS THERE.
 ISRAEL, WAS IT FAIR OR FOUL?
 ISRAEL: I DON'T THINK IT IS
 FAIR.
 HE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE
 IT.
 ANY TIME YOU ARE PAST 18, YOU
 SHOULD PROBABLY RECOGNIZE THAT
 IS NOT A GOOD GESTURE TO DO.
 BUT YOU PROBABLY WANT THE GUY
 SHOOTING THE FREE-THROWS TO SEE
 YOU.
 TONY: GOOD POINT.
 BLACKISTONE.
 KEVIN: IT IS FOUL.
 TONY: WE MOVE ON.
 TEXAS TECH GETTING IN BYING
 THE AIR OUT OF THE BALL ON
 MICHIGAN STATE THE LAST TWO
 MINUTES AND ALSO ALL GAME LONG,
 WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT
 THE P■í THIS IS
 HISTORICALLY LOW SCORING.
 THE OVER/UNDER WAS SET AT.■■■■a
 SET■■■■■■■■■■■■■@■■ LOW, HOW LO
 THIS BE WON?
 WOODY: IT IS NOT A PROBLEM
 BECAUSE THEY ARE EQUAL IN TERMS
 OF HOW THEY PLAY THE GAME.
 THEY BOTH HAVE MOTION OFFENSES
 THAT BASICALLY HAVE COME FROM
 PEEL NEWELL AND BOB KNIGHT, WHO
 MENTORED BEARD.
 YOU LOOK AT WHAT VIRGINIA HAS
 DONE, AND THAT IS BASED ON THE
 MOTION OFFENSE.
 SO OFFENSIVELY THEY ARE GOING
 TO TAKE TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE
 PASSING THE BALL TO GET THE
 BEST SHOT.
 DEFENSIVELY YOU'VE GOT TWO
 TEAMS THAT ARE BASICALLY THE
 SAME IN TERMS OF HOW MANY
 POINTS THEY GIVE UP.
 ABOUT 55 PER GAME BOTH DURING
 THE REGULAR SEASON AND DURING
 THE TOURNAMENT.
 YOU CAN THINK THAT IS GOING TO
 BE AROUND 110.
 TAKE THE UNDER.
 BUT I THINK THAT VIRGINIA HAS A
 SLIGHT EDGE BECAUSE OF THE FACT
 THEY PLAY THE DEFENSE A BIT
 STRONGER THAN TEXAS TECH.
 ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE RED
 RAIDERS PLAY TOUGHER.
 TONY: WAIT, WAIT.
 ONE SIDE IS STRONGER AND THE
 OTHER SIDE IS TOUGHER.
 DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TRYING
 TO GET TO THERE.
 LET'S SEE IF ISRAEL DOES.
 ISRAEL: I AM NOT SURE WHAT HE
 IS TRYING TO GET THERE, BUT
 BOTH TEAMS ARE DEFENSIVE
 POWERS.
 IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE TEXAS TECH
 HAS BEEN MORE DOMINANT IN
 STRETCHES, WHETHER IN THE
 TOURNAMENT OR JUST IN THE FINAL
 FOUR.
 THAT IN THE END IS WHAT IS
 GOING TO LEAN ME TOWARDS TEXAS
 TECH.
 THE STYLES ARE SIMILAR.
 VIRGINIA HAS JUST GOT A WAY TO
 SLOW THE GAME DOWN.
 TEXAS TECH CAN DO THAT, BUT WE
 CAN SCORE A LITTLE BUILT IN
 BUNCHES.
 THE ONLY REASON I WOULD PICK
 VIRGINIA IS TO SAY IN A CLOSE
 GAME, ALL OF A SUDDEN TEXAS
 TECH IS GOING TO CHOKE OR NOT
 KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 I DON'T BELIEVE.
 THAT I THINK TEXAS TECH CAN WIN
 BY DOUBLE FIGURES.
 TONY: K.B., IS THAT HOW YOU SEE
 IT?
 KEVIN: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,
 BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING
 TO BE LIKE THE WISCONSIN TEAM
 THAT ONLY PUT UP 41 IN THE 2000
 FINAL FOUR.
 IT IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN
 THAT.
 YOU HAVE SOME OFFENSIVELY
 SKILLED PLAYERS WHO CAN MAKE
 PLAYS.
 JEROME A GINOBILI-ERVING PLAYER
 FOR VIRGINIA, AND CULVER ON THE
 OTHER SIDE.
 MOONEY HAS BEEN HITTING CLUTCH
 THREE-POINT SHOTS.
 IT IS GOING TO BE A GRIND.
 I DON'T THINK THAT IS GOING TO
 BE A BAD CAN'T THING.
 ONE THING WE ENJOY IS A TENSE
 GAME.
 I DON'T THINK THE DEFENSES WILL
 MUCK IT UP AND MAKE IT UGLY.
 TONY: MINA KIMES, YOU ARE
 SMIRKING A LITTLE BIT THERE.
 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
 MINA: WELL, IT IS POSSIBLE I
 HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO TOO MUCH
 OLD TOWN ROAD TOO MUCH.
 I AM GOING WITH TEXAS TECH.
 PICKED THEM FOR THE UPSET FOR A
 CUP 8 OF REASONS.
 VIRGINIA HAS BEEN THE BETTER
 REGULAR SEASON TEAM, BUT TEXAS
 TECH HAS BEEN BETTER IN THE
 TOURNAMENT.
 THEY HAVE DEFEATED A MURDERER'S
 ROW OF TEAMS, INCLUDING
 GONZAGA.
 I THINK TEXAS TECH HAS THE BEST
 NBA PROSPECT LEFT IN THIS IN
 JARRETT CULVER.
 HE HAS BEEN HOT AND CALLED.
 HE WOULD COME UP IN THE CLUTCH.
 TONY: THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR
 YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULD WIN THE
 POOL ON THIS.
 WOODER, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
 STRONGER AND TOUGHER?
 WOODY: TEXAS TECH HAS BEATEN
 FOUR NUMBER ONE AND TWO SEEDS.
 VIRGINIA WOULD BE THE FIRST
 TEAM SINCE 1979 TO ACTUALLY WIN
 THE TOURNAMENT WITHOUT HAVING
 BEATEN A NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER
 FWOFMENT
 TONY: THAT IS A GOOD POINT.
 AND THEY NEEDED A LOT TO MAKE
 THAT HAPPEN.
 TWO FOR TEXAS TECH AND TWO FOR
 VIRGINIA OR IS IT 3-1?
 I DID HEAR ISRAEL SAY IT COULD
 BE DOUBLE DIGITS.
 I AM HAPPY TO HEAR THE GAME
 COULD GET INTO DOUBLE DIGITS.
 MAYBE A 12-9 AFFAIR WE
 FINE.
 IF IT IS IN THE 40'S, MAYBE IT
 WILL BE AS CLOSE AS
 BAYLOR-NOTRE DAME LAST NIGHT.
 THIS WAS THRILLING HOW IT
 FINISHED.
  INJURY TO LAU■■=■=WM■■>■1■7■zZ
 TITLE WITH THE LAST YEAR
 NOT BEING ABLE TO TIE IT■p UP O
 THE LINE THIS YEAR.
 K.B., HOW DO YOU THINK THIS
 GAME WILL BE REMEMBERED, BY THE
 JACKSON MAKE OR OGUNBOWALE'S
 MISS?
 KEVIN: IT MAY BE UNFAIRLY BY
 U.S.A. BASKETBALL'S■ MISS ONLY
 BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU JUST
 POINTED OUT.
 SHE WALKS TO THE FREE-THROW
 LINE, AND YOU JUST ASSUME THAT
 BOTH OF THOSE ARE GOING DOWN.
 THEN SHE IS GIVEN THE ORDER TO
 MISS THE SECOND ONE.
 YOU DON'T PRACTICE MISSING
 FREE-THROWS.
 THAT MUSCLE MEMORY KICKED IN,
 AND THE BALL STILL GOES IN THE
 HOOP, AND THEY ARE BEHIND THE
 8-BALL.
 I WILL REMEMBER IT FOR CLOWE'S
 GREAT LAY-UP.
 SHE IS OUT OF THE WASHINGTON,
 D.C. AREA.
 FIRST TIME EVER PLAYING POINT
 GUARD, WINS ONE FOR BAYLOR.
 THAT WAS GREAT.
 MINA: IN THE SHORT TERM, LUGO
 ARIKE.
 SHE IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE
 GREATEST COLLEGE BASKETBALL
 PLAYERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE
 GAME.
 SHE SCORED 31 POINTS, SECOND
 MOST IN THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP EVER.
 UNFORTUNATELY, IT ENDED HOW IT
 DID.
 HOPEFULLY, JACKSON WILL BE
 REMEMBERED FOR HAVING A GREAT
 TOURNAMENT AND BROUGHT THIS
 TEAM TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP.
 TONY WOODY PAIGE?
 TONY: I AM GOING TO REMEMBER IT
 BECAUSE OF CLOWE.
 LAUREN COX WHEN SHE WENT OUT IN
 THE THIRD QUARTER, I THINK IT
 CHANGED THE DIMENSION OF THE
 GAME BECAUSE BAYLOR WAS ABLE TO
 GET INSIDE.
 AT THE VERY END THEY CALLED THE
 SAME PLAY FOR CLOWE THAT THEY
 DID AGAINST -- FOR CLOWE THAT
 THEY DID AGAINST OREGON.
 I THINK THAT PLAY MADE THE REAL
 DIFFERENCE IN THE GAME AND THE
 FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET
 INSIDE ALL GAME.
 54 POINTS IN THE PAINT AND
 NOTRE DAME ONLY HAD 24.
 THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED TO THE
 YEAR ALL YEAR.
 TONY AND ISRAEL GUTIERREZ?
 ISRAEL: IF YOU ARE GOING TO
 JUDGE THIS BASED ON THE MISSED
 FREE-THROW AT THE END, IT WAS
 BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T WORKING.
 CHLOE JACKSON WAS DOING
 EVERYTHING SHE COULD.
 SHE LOOKED LIKE THE QUICKEST
 PLAYER ON THE COURT.
 EARLIER IN THE DAY SHE ALMOST
 CHOKED ON A JUMBO SHRIMP.
 THAT IS AN INTERESTING DAY FOR
 SOMEBODY WHO HAD TO HAVE THEIR
 LIFE SAVED POTENTIALLY BY A
 TEAMMATE AND THEN YOU WIN A
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.
