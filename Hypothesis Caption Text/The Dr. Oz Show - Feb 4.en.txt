 DR. OZ: R. KELLY, THE STORY THE WORLD IS WATCHING.
 WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR
 R. KELLY?
 JAIL TIME.
 I THINK HE MIGHT NEED BEHIND
 BARS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
 DR. OZ: WE HAVE THE FIRST WOMAN
 TO TESTIFY AGAINST HIM.
 HE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE
 MERKED ME.
 MERKED MEANS TO KILL YOU
 SGLFMENT AND A DAYTIME
 EXCLUSIVE.
 GLORIA ALLRED WEIGHS IN ON THE
 THREAT HE MADE AGAINST HER
 CLIENT.
 WILL A CONVICTION BE COMING
 SOON?
 TOUGH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
 IT.
 DR. OZ: COMING UP NEXT.
 COULD R. KELLY BE GOING BACK TO
 COURT ON NEW SEXUAL ASSAULT
 ALLEGATIONS?
 THE HIP-HOP SUPERSTAR HAS BEEN
 ACCUSED OF PREYING ON TEENAGE
 GIRLS FOR DECADES.
 R. KELLY HAS ALWAYS DENIED
 EVERY ALLEGATION.
 AND HIS FANS HAVEN'T KNOWN WHAT
 TO THINK.
 BUT NOW THE ACCUSATIONS AND
 BACKLASH H HAVE HIT A RECORD HI
 WITH REPORTS THAT HE'S BEING
 INVESTIGATED BY THE F.B.I.
 TODAY, WE HAVE EXCLUSIVE
 INTERVIEWS AND INSIGHT FROM
 PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY KNOW HIM
 BEST.
 AND THESE ACCUSATIONS COULD
 CHANGE EVERYTHING.
 THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF
 SHOCKING ACCUSATIONS AND CLAIMS
 AGAINST R&B SUPERSTAR R. KELLY.
 ALLEGATIONS HE HAD SEX WITH
 UNDER AGE GIRLS AND ABUSIVE
 RELATIONSHIPS WITH DOZENS OF
 WOMEN.
 SOME BELIEVE TO BE KEPT BY
 KELLY AGAINST THEIR WILL.
 SPARKING BACKLASH AND A
 MOVEMENT.
 A GROUP OF WOMEN ARMED WITH
 PETITIONS ASKED FULTON COUNTY
 LEADERS TO CANCEL AN R&B
 CONCERT FEATURING R. KELLY.
 A COUPLE CLAIMS THE SINGER
 R. KELLY IS HOLDING THEIR
 DAUGHTER AGAINST HER WILL.
 THE FIRST TIME SINGER R.
 KELLY IS RESPONDING THROUGH HIS
 ATTORNEY TO THE DOCUSERIES
 ACCUSING HIM OF HOLDING YOUNG
 WOMEN AGAINST THEIR WILL.
 DR. OZ: A SUPERSTAR UNDER
 SCRUTINY AS MUTT TIM ACCUSERS
 SPANNING DECADES CLAIM SINGER
 R. KELLY ABUSED AND KEPT WOMEN
 CAP ACTIVE AS SEX SLAVES.
 SHARING INSIGHT INTO THE
 ALLEGED SHOCKING AND SOMETIMES
 SECRETIVE WORLD OF R&B STAR R.
 KELLY.
 TODAY WE'RE UNRAVELING THE
 SHOCKING ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL
 ABUSE AGAINST HIP-HOP SUPERSTAR
 R. KELLY.
 NOW, HE HAS ALWAYS DENIED EVERY
 ALLEGATION.
 BUT NOW WITH HIS FAMILY
 SPEAKING OUT AGAINST HIM, AND
 REPORTS OF A CRIMINAL
 INVESTIGATION, WHAT DOES THE
 FUTURE HOLD FOR R. KELLY?
 CRIME ONLINE FOUNDER AND FORMER
 PROSECUTOR NANCY GRACE JOINS ME
 NOW.
 THE ALLEGATIONS AS WE SHOULD
 ALL KNOW AGAINST R. KELLY HAVE
 BEEN SCROLLING FOR YEARS.
 WHY NOW ARE WE HEARING REPORTS
 OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS?
 WELL, I THINK WE'RE HEARING
 ABOUT IT NOW MORE SO THAN
 BEFORE IS BECAUSE FAMILY
 MEMBERS ARE SPEAKING OUT.
 BUT THIS GOES BACK BEFORE 1994
 AND I HAD TO ADD THAT UP.
 THAT'S OVER 20 YEARS THAT THIS
 HAS BEEN SWIRLING.
 HE MARRIED ALEA.
 THEY LIED ABOUT THEIR MARRIAGE
 CERTIFICATE.
 HE MARRIED HER WHEN SHE WAS
 JUST 15 YEARS OLD.
 AT BEST.
 ALL RIGHT?
 SO SINCE 1994, WE'VE KNOWN THIS
 IS WHO ROBERT SILVESTER KELLY
 IS.
 HE'S NOT R.
 HE'S NOT R. KELLY.
 HE'S ROBERT SYLVESTER KELLY.
 DR. OZ: EXPLAIN THE
 ALLEGATIONS.
 WHAT ARE THEY SPECIFICALLY
 AGAINST R. KELLY?
 YEAH.
 HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
 AND IT STEMS FROM THE
 ALLEGATIONS.
 THE ALLEGATIONS CURRENTLY ARE
 THAT FEMALE FAMILY MEMBERS,
 YOUNG LADIES, ARE BEING HELD
 AGAINST THEIR WILL IN A
 CULT-LIKE ATMOSPHERE SPANNING
 TWO LOCATIONS.
 CHICAGO AND ATLANTA.
 AND SIX PROPERTIES OWNED OR
 RENTED BY ROBERT SILVESTER
 KELLY, ALIAS R. KELLY, ALIAS R.
 THAT THESE WOMEN, HERE'S THE
 PROBLEM, ARE OF AGE AND IN MANY
 CASES WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE NOW
 COMING OUT AND SPEAKING ABOUT
 WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM, THE
 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAS
 PASSED.
 NOW, CHICAGO, THEY HAVE A
 CHANCE.
 BECAUSE A NEW LAW IS
 RETROACTIVE.
 THESE WOMEN WANT TO COME
 FORWARD AND PROSECUTE, THERE
 MAY BE A CHANCE THEY CAN.
 BUT RIGHT NOW, IT HASN'T
 HAPPENED.
 AND NOBODY SEEMS TO BE
 BELIEVING THESE WOMEN.
 I DON'T GET IT.
 NOBODY IS LISTENING TO THEM.
 IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN?
 IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE
 MINORITIES?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK.
 AND I TEND TO AGREE WITH THEM.
 DR. OZ: AND YOU SAY NO ONE IS
 LISTENING BUT A BACKLASH
 AGAINST R. KELLY.
 IS HE IN JAIL?
 DID I MISS THAT?
 NO, HE'S NOT.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS THE BACKLASH
 AGAINST HIM?
 AND THERE ARE --
 THE BACKLASH IS --
 DR. OZ: SEPARATING THEMSELVES

 THE INDUSTRY.
 DR. OZ: A DOCUSERIES THAT MADE
 A LOT OF NOISE.
 THE DOCUSERIES MADE A LOT OF
 NOISE BECAUSE SOME ACTUAL
 ALLEGED VICTIMS SPOKE OUT.
 AND I COMPLETELY BELIEVE THEM.
 AND THE VICTIMS ARE BEING
 DEMONIZED TO SUGGEST THAT THEY
 WANT MONEY.
 THEY WANT FAME.
 THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF
 GROUPIES.
 THEY ARE A BUNCH OF GIRLS.
 THEY'RE NOT GROUPIES.
 AND THEY THINK -- ONE OF THEM
 SAID, OH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
 THIS LAVISH LIFESTYLE WITH THIS
 STAR.
 NO.
 THEY HAVE TO KNOCK TO GET OUT
 OF THEIR ROOM OF THE THEY HAVE
 TO WEAR BAGGY CLOTHES SO NOBODY
 CAN SEE THEIR CURVES.
 THEY HAVE TO LOOK DOWN AT THE
 FLOOR.
 THEY CAN'T -- THEY HAVE TO ASK
 R. KELLY TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
 AND THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED LIKE
 PETS.
 THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER AND
 YOU ASK THEM THEY SAY THEY'RE
 IN LOVE AND DON'T WANT TO
 LEAVE.
 DR. OZ: I'VE HEARD THESE
 ALLEGATIONS AND KNOW THIS
 DOCUMENTARY THERE'S BEEN A LOT
 OF NOISE.
 LADY GAGA, CELINE DION HAVE
 PULLED THEIR COLLABORATIONS
 WITH HIM AND OFFLINE AND YOU
 CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE.
 KIKI PALM, JADA PINKETT SMITH,
 CHRISTINE AGUILERA, AND R.
 KELLY HAS BEEN DROPPED BY SONY
 MUSIC.
 SO HOW DO -- DOES IT IMPACT ON
 THIS WHOLE CASE THAT HIS
 DAUGHTER HAS GONE ON SOCIAL
 MEDIA CALLING HIM A MONSTER,
 WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
 IT TELLS ME THAT THE
 DAUGHTER -- AND I HATE TO --
 THIS SO MUCH BECAUSE THE
 CHILDREN OBSERVE THE WAY HE
 TREATED THEIR MOTHER.
 SHE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO
 KILL HER IN HIS HUMMER.
 SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS DYING.
 DR. OZ: THE MOTHER?
 THE MOTHER.
 AND THE CHILDREN SAW THIS.
 AND WHEN -- ONE OF THOSE
 CHILDREN FINALLY TOLD THEIR
 STORY, I THINK IT'S GOING TO
 HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT.
 DR. OZ: ALL RIGHT.
 SO BACK TO THIS -- THE COURT OF
 PUBLIC OPINION.
 WHAT DO THE FANS THINK ABOUT
 THIS AND WHAT ARE THEY SAYING
 ONLINE?
 YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE SO
 MUCH?
 WHEN THESE CLAIMS FIRST STARTED
 SURFACING AND THESE WOMEN WERE
 COMING OUT AND SPEAKING
 SPECIFICALLY THREE OF HIS
 VICTIMS, PEOPLE WERE SAYING,
 YOU'RE LYING.
 AND YOU CAN SEE THE COMMENTS
 ONLINE.
 YOU'RE LYING.
 YOU JUST WANT MONEY.
 THAT'S THE WAY THAT THEY ARE
 TREATED.
 AND I'M -- I SEE -- AND I THINK
 THAT, TOO.
 R. KELLY HAS ALREADY WON AT
 TRIAL ONCE ON CHARGES HE MADE A
 VIDEO OF HIM HAVING SEX WITH A
 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND THEN
 YOU'RE DEMERITTED ON HER --
 URINATETD ON HER AND I THINK IN
 HER MOUTH.
 IF THEY DON'T CONVICT HIM WHERE
 WILL YOU GET A JURY THAT WILL?
 DR. OZ: ONE OF THE MOST
 SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS IS GIRLS
 WERE BEING GROOMED AND FOR THAT
 REASON BEING HELD UNDER HIS
 CONTROL.
 WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT,
 AND THESE ARE ALLEGATIONS AND
 REPORTED THAT THE FULTON COUNTY
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND
 THE COOK COUNTY STATE
 ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ARE IN THE
 PROCESS OF LAUNCHING
 INVESTIGATIONS ON BEHALF OF
 PARENTS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR
 DAUGHTERS BEING HELD.
 YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW THAT
 BECAUSE THAT MEANS THERE'S SOME
 MOVEMENT HAPPENING HERE.
 WE REACHED OUT TO BOTH OFFICES.
 FULTON COUNTY DECLINED TO
 COMMENT AND COOK COUNTY DID NOT
 GET BACK TO US IN TIME FOR THIS
 TAPING AND WE REACHED TOUT R.
 KELLY'S LEGAL TEAM AFTER THE
 DOCUSERIES AIRED AND THEY
 HAVEN'T GOTTEN BACK TO US.
 BUT HIS ATTORNEY STEPHFON
 GREENBERG MADE THE FOLLOWING
 PUBLIC STATEMENTS.
 I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS.
 HE SAID WHERE'S THE PROOF?
 HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
 AND THERE ARE NO UNDER AGE
 VICTIMS.
 THERE ARE NO SEXUAL ASSAULT
 VICTIMS AND NO VICTIMS OF
 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT THEY'RE
 GOING TO FIND AND DIDN'T EVER
 HAPPEN.
 THOSE ARE VERY SPECIFIC
 DEFENSES.
 AS A PROSECUTOR HOW DO YOU
 RESPOND TO THAT?
 I THINK THAT'S A LIE.
 AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
 AND LOOK AT HIS TRACK RECORD.
 DID HE BEAT HIS WIFE?
 SHE SAYS HE DID.
 I BELIEVE SHE IS TELLING THE
 TRUTH.
 OTHER WITNESSES WOULD BE HIS
 CHILDREN.
 DID THEY OBSERVE IN THE HOME?
 IF THESE WOMEN, HE'S GOT NOW
 ARE BRAINWASHED, THEY'RE NEVER
 GOING TO REVEAL WHAT'S
 HAPPENING.
 AND IT'S NOT JUST HIM.
 IT'S LIKE WEINSTEIN, WHERE THEY
 HAVE THE FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
 SET UP THE MEETING AND THEY ALL
 KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, HE'S
 GOT A WHOLE GROUP AROUND HIM
 CALLED RUNNERS THAT DO ALL HIS
 BIDDING.
 THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ENFORCE
 HIS LAWS, HIS RULES ON THESE
 YOUNG LADIES.
 AND REMEMBER, SOME OF THEM ARE
 AT AGE NOW.
 AND THEY'RE STILL IN THERE.
 THE LAW CAN'T TOUCH IT.
 DR. OZ: WHAT KIND OF LEGAL
 ACTION CAN WE EXPECT THEN?
 I DO BELIEVE THAT THE
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN
 FULTON AND COOK ARE
 INVESTIGATING AND BELIEVE YOU
 ME, OZ, WHEN THEY GET ONE GIRL
 THAT FITS WITHIN THE STATUTE OF
 LIMITATIONS, THEY'RE GOING TO
 PROSECUTE.
 IF THEY CAN JUST GET ONE GIRL
 WITHIN THE STATUTE THAT WAS
 UNDER AGE, HE'S TOAST.
 DR. OZ: IF THEY CAN GET ONE
 GIRL THAT FITS THEIR NEEDS,
 WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR
 R. KELLY?
 JAIL TIME.
 HE CAN MAKE MUSIC BEHIND BARS
 AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
 DR. OZ: UP NEXT, WE WILL MEET A
 WOMAN WHO SAYS SHE KNOWS THE
 REAL R. KELLY.
 SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER
 TESTIFY AGAINST HIM IN COURT
 FOR SEXUAL ABUSE.
 STAY WITH US.
 DR. OZ: WE REACHED OUTEACHED OU
     Our grandparents checked        their smartphones
        zero times a day.
          Times change.          Eyes haven't.
   That's why there's Ocuvite.
         Screen light...

             Ocuvite.     Eye nutrition for today.
 Who said olive oil is the only heart-healthy cooking oil?
 Mazola corn oil has more cholesterol-blocking
 plant sterols than olive oil.
 And a clinical study showed it can help
 lower cholesterol 2X more.
 When it comes to heart-health, Mazola is a smart choice.

 TO US IN TIME FOR THIS TAPING. WE'RE BACK UNRAVELING THE
 ALLEGATIONS AGAINST R&B
 SUPERSTAR R. KELLY.
 WHO IS NOW REPORTEDLY UNDER
 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AFTER
 NEW EXPLOSIVE ACCUSATIONS OF
 SEXUAL ABUSE HAVE SURFACED.
 BUT SOME WOMEN HAVE BEEN
 SPEAKING OUT AGAINST HIM FOR
 YEARS.
 LISA VAN ALLEN KNOWS R&B SINGER
 R. KELLY'S ALLEGEDLY SORDID
 SIDE FAR TOO WELL.
 SHE WAS JUST 17 WHEN SHE SAYS
 THE SINGER SEDUCED HER AND THAT
 HE BEGAN AN ABUSIVE NINE-YEAR
 RELATIONSHIP.
 ONE IN WHICH SHE WITNESSED MANY
 THINGS SHE CLAIMS CONFIRMS THE
 WORST ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM.
 SHE WAS ALSO THE FIRST WOMAN TO
 OPENLY CONFRONT R. KELLY.
 TAKING THE STAND AGAINST HIM IN
 2008 WHEN HE FACED 14 COUNTS OF
 CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
 HE WOULD BE ACQUITTED OF ALL
 CHARGES IN THAT TRIAL.
 BUT COULD NOT BE -- BUT COULD
 BE FACING NEW ONES AND LISA VAN
 ALLEN REMAINS HIS MOST
 OUTSPOKEN CRITIC.
 AND AN ADVOCATE FOR HIS ALLEGED
 VICTIMS.
 LISA VAN ALLEN JOINS ME NOW.
 REMEMBER, SHE RISKED CHARGES
 AGAINST HERSELF WHEN SHE CAME
 FORWARD ABOUT BEING IN A SEX
 TAPE THAT INVOLVED MY I
 DON'TERS.
 -- THAT INVOLVED MINORS.
 AND WAS GRANTED IMMUNITY FOR
 HER TESTIMONY.
 I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO DO AND
 THANK YOU FOR SHARING A PART OF
 YOUR LIFE.
 WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO TESTIFY
 IN COURT AGAINST R. KELLY?
 WELL, THERE WERE MULTIPLE
 THINGS.
 BUT ONE OF THEM WAS THEY
 ACTUALLY THREATENED MY LIFE.
 HIS TEAM SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE
 MERKED ME FROM THE BEGINNING.
 MERKING MEANS TO KILL YOU.
 IT WAS TOUGH.
 IT WAS REALLY TOUGH WHEN I
 DIDN'T EVER KNOW THEY WERE
 THINKING ABOUT KILLING ME.
 DR. OZ: HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE
 TRIAL FOR YOU?
 HAVING TO GO INTO COURT AND BE
 ASKED THEE QUESTIONS AND BE
 JUDGED?
 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT.
 BECAUSE I WAS ALONE, YOU KNOW?
 HE HAD ALREADY THREATENED MY
 LIFE.
 I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE
 BACKING ME.
 NO ONE ELSE COMING OUT.
 IT WAS TOUGH.
 DR. OZ: SORRY.
 IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU THINK
 ABOUT IT.
 DR. OZ: IT'S OK.
 TAKE YOUR TIME.
 JUST THINKING ABOUT
 EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?
 I WANTED TO SPEAK OUT FOR THE
 YOUNG GIRL ON THE TAPE.
 DR. OZ: SORRY.
 AND THEY KNOW WHAT WAS IN
 IT.
 THEY SAID THAT ONE OF THE
 REASONS THAT THEY COULDN'T
 PROSECUTE HIM WAS BECAUSE THE
 VICTIM SAID IT WASN'T HER AND
 HER FATHER SAID IT WASN'T HER.
 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT OUT
 THERE THAT THE PROSECUTOR TOLD
 ME WHEN HER FATHER WATCHED THE
 TAPE, HE CRIED WHEN HE SAID IT
 WASN'T HER.
 AND IF IT'S NOT YOUR DAUGHTER,
 WHAT WERE YOU CRYING ABOUT?
 DR. OZ: LET'S GO BACK TO THE
 BEGINNING.
 I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU
 MET HIM AND HOW YOUR
 RELATIONSHIP WITH R. KELLY
 EVOLVED.
 UH-HUH.
 DR. OZ: WHEN YOU DID FIRST SEE
 HIM?
 I MET HIM AT A VIDEO SHOOT
 IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA.
 IT WAS -- HIS HOME ALONE VIDEO
 SHOOT.
 DR. OZ: SO THE RELATIONSHIP
 STARTS, YOU BECAME INTIMATE
 RELATIVELY QUICKLY?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: AND YOU WERE HAPPY?
 FROM THE BEGINNING, IT
 WASN'T REALLY BAD.
 YOU KNOW?
 FIRST IT WAS LIKE WHEN I MOVED
 UP THERE, THE FIRST TIME WE HAD
 A THREESOME HE TOLD ME HE WOULD
 NEVER HAVE ONE.
 SO I FELT LIKE AS HIS
 GIRLFRIEND THAT IT WAS
 SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DO FOR
 HIM BECAUSE HE IS A STAR.
 AND I'M SURE WOMEN COME ON TO
 HIM ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW?
 AND I'M 17.
 SO I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
 SAY NO.
 AND THAT CAN BE OK.
 AND IF HE LOVES YOU, HE'LL BE
 OK WITH THAT.
 DR. OZ: BUT OVER TIME, HOW DID
 YOU FIND THE RELATIONSHIP
 CHANGED?
 OVER TIME, I GOT OLDER.
 AND WISER.
 BECAUSE IT REALLY DIDN'T
 CHAPING.
 THE THREESOMES BECAME MORE
 FREQUENT.
 ONCE IT HAPPENED WITH THE GIRL
 THAT WAS 14, AND IN THE
 BEGINNING, WHEN I WAS 17 SHE
 TOLD ME SHE WAS 16 AND THE
 REASON FOR THAT, I BELIEVE, IS
 BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT, YOU
 KNOW F. SHE WAS MY AGE, I WOULD
 BE OK WITH IT.
 BUT ONCE I FOUBD OUT THROUGH
 HER THAT SHE WAS 14, IT NEVER
 HAPPENED AGAIN.
 I WAS NOT OK WITH THAT.
 YOU KNOW, THAT MADE ME SICK TO
 MY STOMACH TO KNOW THAT I WAS
 17 WHEN SHE WAS 14.
 AND STILL WITH A MINOR, IT WAS
 JUST -- IT WASN'T OK WITH ME.
 DR. OZ: DID YOU FEEL THAT HE
 WAS MANIPULATING YOU?
 YES.
 I FEEL LIKE EVERY WOMAN OR GIRL
 THAT HE'S WITH, HE MANIPULATES
 THEM.
 HE MAKES SURE HE DOES THINGS
 THE WAY HE NEEDED THEM TO GET
 DONE TO GET WHAT -- THE OUTCOME
 HE WANTS.
 DR. OZ: SO AFTER GOING THROUGH
 THIS FOR A WHILE, YOU DECIDE TO
 END THE RELATIONSHIP.
 YEAH.
 DR. OZ: HOW MANY YEARS INTO
 KNOWING HIM DID YOU END IT AND
 WHY DID YOU END IT?
 WELL, I LIVED WITH HIM FOR
 THREE YEARS.
 SO AT 21, THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
 TO LEAVE.
 I NEVER TOLD HIM THAT I WAS
 LEAVING.
 I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO GO VISIT
 WITH MY FAMILY.
 AND I MADE UP SOME LITTLE
 URGENT SITUATION THAT I NEEDED
 TO LEAVE FOR.
 AND I JUST DIDN'T GO BACK.
 DR. OZ: UP NEXT THE MOST
 SHOCKING ALLEGATION TO COME OUT
 ABOUT R. KELLY.
 LISA REVEALS WHAT SHEE
 TOLD HER.
 STAY WITH US.

 DR. OZ: WE'RE BACK WITH LISA VAN ALLEN.
 THE FIRST WOMAN TO TESTIFY
 AGAINST R. KELLY FOR SEXUAL
 ABUSE ALLEGATIONS.
 SO WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT AGAINST
 HIM, AND LIFETIME SERIES YOU
 WERE INTERVIEWED.
 UH-HUH.
 DR. OZ: WHAT KIND OF BACKLASH
 DID YOU EXPERIENCE AND WHAT
 HAPPENED TO R. KELLY?
 HOW DIFFICULT HAS IT BEEN FOR
 YOU SINCE TELLING YOUR STORY?
 I'VE ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF
 SUPPORT LIKE ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA
 ACCOUNTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT,
 I'VE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT.
 THERE ARE SOME DIEHARD FANS.
 THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT JUST
 CHOOSE NOT TO BELIEVE WHAT -- I
 FEEL LIKE IS JUST IN YOUR FACE.
 IT'S PUBLIC RECORD.
 YOU CAN GO TO COOK COUNTY
 COURTHOUSE AND PULL UP ALL
 THESE CASES THAT HE PAID GIRLS
 OFF.
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
 WOULD PAY ANYONE OFF IF IT'S
 NOT TRUE.
 DR. OZ: SO NANCY, DO YOU LIVE
 -- YOU LIVE IN THIS WORLD.
 IF THERE WAS A NEW TRIAL TODAY,
 WOULD IT TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY
 FOR --
 I THINK IT ABSOLUTELY WOULD.
 AND WILL TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY.
 BECAUSE I BELIEVE -- NOT JUST
 FROM MY HEART BUT AS A
 PROSECUTOR, THAT EITHER FULTON
 OR COOK COUNTY, CHICAGO OR
 ATLANTA, ARE GOING TO FIND THAT
 GIRL THAT FITS IN THE STATUTE
 OF LIMITATIONS SO LEGALLY THEY
 CAN BRING THIS CASE.
 DR. OZ: LISA, WOULD YOU TESTIFY
 AGAIN?
 IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE WHEN I
 THINK ABOUT THAT, THEY HAD ME
 ON THE STAND FOR THREE HOURS.
 AND I WAS SIX MONTHS' PREGNANT
 WITH MY SON.
 AND THEY DIDN'T ASK ME ONE
 QUESTION ABOUT ROB.
 FOR THREE HOURS.
 AND THEY -- LIKE THEY TRIED TO
 -- IT'S HARD.
 I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD WANT TO
 RELIVE THAT.
 LIKE MY GOAL RIGHT NOW IS TO
 RAISE AWARENESS AND I WANT TO
 HELP -- I WANT TO HELP ALL
 ABUSE VICTIMS LIKE -- IT'S
 TOUGH.
 DR. OZ: WHAT'S MOST SHOCKING
 ABOUT THIS CASE IS PEOPLE VERY
 CLOSE TO R. KELLY ARE COMING
 FORWARD.
 CARRIE KELLY HAS CLAIMED THAT
 BOTH AND HE HIS BROTHER WERE
 VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE
 HANDS OF THEIR SISTER.
 THEIR OLDER SISTER.
 I BELIEVE HIM.
 BECAUSE ROBERT TOLD ME THAT HE
 WAS ABUSED BY HIS SISTER,
 TERESA.
 HE DID.
 DR. OZ: R. KELLY TOLD THAT YOU?
 HE TOLD ME THAT.
 HE DID.
 DR. OZ: DID HE SHARE WITH YOU
 MORE DETAILS ABOUT THAT?
 THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HIM
 PENETRATE HER WITH A PENCIL.
 THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.
 DR. OZ: SO WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO
 FIND HIS OLDER SISTER.
 UH-HUH.
 DR. OZ: PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE
 BEEN THERE AT THE TIME.
 RIGHT.
 DR. OZ: SO I'M TRYING TO PUT
 THE PIECES OF THIS VERY
 COMPLICATED PUZZLE TOGETHER.
 UH-HUH.
 DR. OZ: WHILE WE'RE ALL TRYING
 TO ALSO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE
 HASN'T BEEN SOMETHING DONE.
 YES.
 DR. OZ: FOR ALL THESE YEARS.
 YES.
 DR. OZ: SO I APPRECIATE YOU
 COMING FORWARD.
 I KNOW IT'S HARD AND GOT SPEED
 AND ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE
 TRYING TO DO.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: THANKS, LISA.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 DR. OZ: MORE ACCUSATIONS A LAWSUIT AGAINST R. KELLY THAT
 TOOK EVERYONE BY SURPRISE AND
 ALLEGATIONS OF RE

       But, you didn't come            from ALDI.

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE'RE BACK ASKING COULD
 R. KELLY BE GOING BACK TO
 COURT?
 A NEW SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGE?
 ANOTHER WOMAN HAS COME FORWARD
 WITH HER OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNTS
 OF R. KELLY'S ALLEGED ABUSE.
 SHE IS SPEAKING OUT IN A
 DAYTIME EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW FOR
 THE FIRST TIME SINCE FILING AN
 UNEXPECTED LAWSUIT AGAINST R.
 KELLY.
 WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY ABOUT HIM
 COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING:--
 CHANGE EMPING.
 THERE ARE NEW LEGAL TROUBLES
 FOR SINGER R. KELLY AS GLORIA
 ALLRED IS REPRESENTING SOME OF
 HIS VICTIMS INCLUDING FAITH
 RODGERS.
 TAKING THE STAND AGAINST R.
 KELLY, SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
 TERMED THE KING OF R&B, AND IS
 LOVED BY MANY HAS NOT BEEN
 EASY.
 I DECIDED AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF
 THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD SPEAK MY
 TRUTH BECAUSE IT IS TIME I
 STAND UP FOR MYSELF.
 DR. OZ: IN 2018, RODGERS FILED
 A CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST KELLY
 IN NEW YORK FOR FALSE
 IMPRISONMENT, ALLEGED SEXUAL
 BATTERY, AND DELIBERATELY
 INFECTING HER WITH AN S.T.D.
 ROBERT KELLY, THE FAITH
 RODGERS YOU KNEW THAT YOU MET
 WHEN I WAS 19 NO LONGER EXISTS.
 SHE WAS VULNERABLE AND
 IMPRESSIONABLE.
 THE 21-YEAR-OLD FAITH RODGERS
 YOU'RE SEEING NOW IS MUCH WISER
 AND MUCH STRONGER.
 DR. OZ: FAITH RODGERS JOINS ME
 NOW.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: I KNOW IT'S HARD TO GO
 OVER SOME OF THIS.
 BUT IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT.
 RIGHT.
 DR. OZ: HOW DID R. KELLY COME
 INTO YOUR LIFE?
 I MET R. KELLY AT A CONCERT
 WITH MY OLDER SISTER.
 IT WASN'T EVEN, YOU KNOW, A
 PLANNED THING, RANDOM WEEKDAYS,
 LIKE COME TO R. KELLY SHOW WITH
 ME.
 AND I END UP GOING.
 WE END UP MEETING AT THE
 CONCERT.
 WE EXCHANGED NUMBERS BACK STAGE
 THAT NIGHT.
 DR. OZ: AND THE SECOND TIME YOU
 MET HIM, IT WASN'T QUITE SO
 INNOCENT?
 RIGHT.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DID HE DO THAT
 MADE YOU CONCERNED?
 JUST -- YOU REALLY GOT TO
 SEE HIS -- HOW HIS CONTROLLING
 WAYS COME OUT AND THE
 MANIPULATION COMES OUT WHEN
 SOMEBODY IS TEXTING YOU, WHEN
 THEY'RE CALLING YOU AND THEN
 WHEN THEY'RE IN FRONT OF YOU
 AND THE VIBE IS COMPLETELY
 DIFFERENT.
 DR. OZ: SO WHAT -- IN WHAT WAYS
 WOULD HE CONTROL YOU AND GET
 YOU TO DO THINGS YOU WOULDN'T
 NORMALLY DO?
 THERE ARE TIMES ME AND HIM
 WILL BE TALKING NORMAL.
 AND HE'S NOT ALWAYS JUST THIS
 PERSON THAT'S SO MEAN AND SO
 DARK.
 HE KNOWS HOW TO SLIP IT, YOU
 KNOW?
 SO THERE WILL BE TIMES WHERE
 WE'RE SITTING HERE AND HE'LL
 TELL ME I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 AND HE NEVER COMES BACK.
 AND I'M CALLING AND I'M TECHING
 AND I'M READY TO LEAVE AND THE
 DOORS ARE LOCKED AND YOU CAN'T
 LEAVE AND NO WAY TO GET OUT.
 AND JUST, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL BE
 IN THE STUDIO WITH HIM.
 AND HE'LL BE SINGING FOR YOU
 AND PLAYING THE PIANO FOR YOU
 AND HE'LL DISAPPEAR AND BEFORE
 YOU KNOW IT THREE HOURS HAVE
 GONE BY.
 AND YOU HAVEN'T USED THE
 BATHROOM.
 YOU HAVEN'T ATE.
 AND YOU'RE IN A SITUATION LIKE
 THAT AND TRYING TO MAKE NORMAL
 OUT OF WHAT'S NOT NORMAL IT
 DOESN'T ADD UP.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY SHE WAS 19
 AND SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS
 DOING.
 WHEN USUAL 19, YOU'RE FRESH OUT
 OF HIGH SCHOOL.
 YOU GRADUATE, 17, 18, AND YOU
 DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.
 YES, I THOUGHT I KNEW
 EVERYTHING AND I THOUGHT I WAS
 GROWN ENOUGH TO GET INVOLVED
 WITH AN OLDER MAN NOT KNOWING
 THERE'S REPERCUSSIONS BEHIND
 THE SITUATION.
 SO THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SHED
 LIGHT ON.
 IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE
 SIGN UP FOR.
 DR. OZ: DID IT SEEM CULT-LIKE
 WHEN YOU WERE THERE?
 WERE THERE OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE
 GOING THROUGH THE SAME JUGGLING
 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
 THEY'RE EVEN IN THIS SITUATION?
 WHEN I MET HIM, THAT WAS
 BEFORE ANY OF THE NEWS HAD GOT
 OUT ABOUT THIS HARME -- HAREM
 OR ANYTHING BEFORE SPEAKING
 OUT.
 I WAS ALREADY INVOLVED WITH HIM
 AND TOO LATE TO GO BACK.
 AND I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING.
 SO ONE OF THE LAWSUIT FEW TIMES
 I SAW HIM THAT'S WHEN HE
 FINALLY ADMITTED TO ME THERE
 WAS A GROUP OF GIRLS.
 AND I SAW HIS BEHAVIOR WITH ME,
 HOW CONTROLLING IT WAS.
 SO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A
 WHOLE BUNCH OF WOMEN THAT
 YOU'RE DOING THIS TO, AND
 YOU'RE ADMITTING TO ME THAT YOU
 TRAINED THEM AND YOU'RE RAISING
 THESE GIRLS AND SOME OF THEM
 HAVE BEEN WITH YOU FOR FIVE
 YEARS AND 15 YEARS.
 AND IT'S LIKE WHAT SCARED ME
 WAS THAT HAD BECAME HIS NORMAL
 AND HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT
 NORMAL TO ME.
 THAT'S SCARY.
 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY --
 WHY YOU DIDN'T TRY TO HELP
 THEM?
 YOU KNOW AND I'M -- I COULDN'T
 HELP THEM IF I CAN HELP MYSELF.
 SO I HAVE TO COME TO TERMS AND
 ACCEPT.
 AND I DON'T COME FROM A FAMILY
 OF ABUSE.
 I DON'T -- I'VE NEVER HAD TO GO
 THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
 SO WHEN IT'S IN FRONT OF YOU
 AND NEVER HAPPENED TO YOU, YOU
 HAVE TO REALLY PROCESS AND
 UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT WHAT'S
 GOING ON IN FRONT OF YOU.
 SO WAS THERE CULT BEHAVIOR?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 HAVING TO USE THE BATHROOM,
 HAVING TO ASK PERMISSION TO
 EAT, I CAN REMEMBER I WALKED
 INTO A HOTEL.
 AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR MY
 NAME.
 THEY KNEW WHO I WAS.
 AND THEY WALKED ME UP TO MY
 ROOM.
 NO HOTEL THAT I'VE EVER BEEN TO
 HAS DONE THAT.
 SO THINGS LIKE THAT DEFINITELY
 WERE RED FLAGS.
 DR. OZ: HOW DID YOU FINALLY
 BREAK FREE FROM R. KELLY?
 I ASK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY OTHER
 WOMEN, THE WOMEN HE'S RAISING
 AS YOU SAID HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
 TO.
 IT'S DEFINITELY A PROCESS.
 AND I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE
 GET -- IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU
 JUST WALK AWAY FROM.
 BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN
 MANIPULATED.
 IT'S LIKE FOR ME AND I CAN'T
 SPEAK ON EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT I
 KNOW FOR ME, THE HARDEST PART
 WAS ACCEPTING WHAT I HAD GONE
 THROUGH, ACKNOWLEDGING IT'S
 WRONG.
 BUT WHERE I WENT WRONG IS I
 THOUGHT THAT I COULD TALK TO
 HIM.
 I THOUGHT THAT I COULD CHANGE
 HIM.
 I THOUGHT THAT I COULD MAYBE
 MAKE HIM DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
 IN ME.
 AND YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.
 HE'S NOT GOING TO LOOK AT YOU
 ANY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS IS
 WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YEARS.
 SO WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL?
 SO FOR ME, I REALLY HAD TO LOOK
 INSIDE OF MYSELF AND THINK BACK
 TO THE WAY MY PARENTS HAVE
 RAISED ME.
 I HAVE NO BUSINESS DEALING WITH
 SOMEBODY THREE TIMES MY AGE.
 THAT'S SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T
 HAVE DID.
 AND REALLY, LIKE MY GUILTY
 CONSCIENCE WAS JUST EATING ME
 UP BECAUSE KNOWING THAT ANOTHER
 YOUNG LADY IS IN THAT POSITION,
 AND I'M JUST SITTING HERE AND
 I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.
 IT JUST MADE ME FEEL WORSE THAN
 EVEN BEING INVOLVED WITH HIM.
 SO I JUST KNEW I HAD TO GO.
 DR. OZ: I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HERE.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: AND I KNOW IT'S GOING
 TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND A
 LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO
 UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WHOLE THING
 WORKS.
 RIGHT.
 DR. OZ: I GATHER THAT SOME OF
 THESE YOUNG WOMEN ARE SITTING
 THERE ALMOST ASHAMED THAT
 THEY'VE BEEN MANIPULATED FOR
 WHATEVER REASON BY SOMEONE WHO
 SEEMS TO BE PRETTY GOOD AT IT.
 THOSE ARE THE ALLEGATIONS.
 IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE FEELING?
 THAT FEELING --
 DR. OZ: THEY'RE ASHAMED AND
 THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S HOLDING
 THEM BACK?
 IS THAT PART OF WHAT SLOWED YOU
 DOWN WHEN -- YOU PROBABLY KNEW
 DEEP DOWN YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT
 HIM?
 I WAS ASHAMED.
 NOT ONLY WAS I ASHAMED, THOUGH,
 IT KIND OF WAS JUST LIKE THIS
 MAN THIS H-ALREADY RECORDINGS
 OF -- THIS MAN ALREADY HAD
 RECORDINGS OF ME.
 IMFLAGRANT R PLANTED --
 IMPLANTED SO MUCH FEAR IN MY
 HEART.
 AND I HAD NO THOUGHT OF
 CROSSING HIM OR LEAVING HIM.
 IT MORE WAS LIKE JUST OK, WHAT
 ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR YOU?
 IT WASN'T -- IT WAS ABOUT ME.
 AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE
 SCARED.
 I WAS SCARED.
 BUT I WALKED AWAY JUST BECAUSE
 I WANT TO KNOW PARTS OF IT.
 WHEN I -- WHEN I WALKED AWAY, I
 HAD NO INTENTIONS OF BEING
 RIGHT HERE, OF TALKING TO
 PARENTS, OF TALKING TO OTHER
 VICTIMS.
 I REALLY WAS JUST -- I DIDN'T
 WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE
 SITUATION.
 I KNEW IT WAS WRONG.
 DR. OZ: ARE YOU SCARED NOW?
 SOMETIMES.
 YEAH.
 SOMETIMES.
 I AM SCARED.
 DR. OZ: ALL RIGHT.
 SO UP NEXT, THE S.T.D., FAITH
 SAYS SHE HAS PROVE CAME FROM R.
 KELLY.
 DON'T GO AWAY.
    When you shop with us, you        know how to score.
  But did you know you could be        saving even more?

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE'RE BACK WITH FAITH
 RODGERS AND HER ATTORNEY,
 GLORIA ALLRED.
 JOIN ME IN A DAYTIME EXCLUSIVE
 INTERVIEW.
 SO IT'S A BIG DECISION BY YOU.
 YOU ARE OFTEN PRESENTED WITH
 OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP PEOPLE.
 WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO TAKE
 FAITH'S CASE?
 WELL, FAITH IS DEFINITELY A
 YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS COURAGE.
 AND HER MOTIVES ARE NOT ONLY TO
 ASSERT HER OWN RIGHTS, DR. OZ,
 BUT ALSO AS SHE SAID, SHE WANTS
 TO HELP OTHER YOUNG WOMEN.
 BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY
 TRAUMATIC LEARNING EXPERIENCE
 FOR HER.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: SO FAITH --
 AND SHE'S WILLING TO DO
 THAT.
 SHE'S WILLING TO SAY, AND SHE
 SAYS THIS IN HER LAWSUIT, THAT
 WHAT'S FILED BY HER WONDERFUL
 ATTORNEY, LYDIA AGEW, THAT HE
 KNEW THAT HE HAD HERPES.
 DR. OZ: THIS IS R. KELLY?
 YES.
 AND HE GAVE IT TO HER AND DID
 NOT DISCLOSE TO HER THAT HE HAD
 IT AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD IT.
 AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS
 VERY DANGEROUS.
 AND THAT IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
 TO KNOW THAT IT IS A VIOLATION
 OF PUBLIC HEALTH LAW IN NEW
 YORK TO HAVE A SEXUALLY
 TRANSMITTED DISEASE AND NOT
 TELL YOUR SEXUAL PARTNER THAT
 YOU HAVE IT.
 DR. OZ: ALL RIGHT.
 SO TO REITERATE, FAITH HAS
 FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST R.
 KELLY CLAIMING THAT HE
 KNOWINGLY GAVE HER AN INCURABLE
 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION.
 AN S.T.D.
 AT WHAT POINT DID YOU REALIZE
 THAT YOU HAD BEEN INFECTED?
 AFTER I LEFT.
 DR. OZ: YOU WERE ALREADY GONE?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY
 IRVIN WILLING THAT HE WAS
 INFECT -- INC.ALING THAT HE WAS
 INFECTED?
 HAD HE EVER INTUITED THAT?
 NO.
 AND I NOW REPRESENT ANOTHER
 YOUNG WOMAN WHO ALLEGES THAT
 SHE WAS UNDER AGE WHEN MR.
 KELLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN
 SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH HER.
 AND THAT HE GAVE HER HERPES.
 THIS IS PRIOR TO HIS EVER BEING
 INVOLVED WITH FAITH.
 SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
 THAT IN THE LAWSUIT, IT IS
 ALLEGED THAT HE KNEW THAT HE
 HAD HERPES BECAUSE SOME YEARS
 EARLIER, HE HAD GIVEN IT TO
 SOMEONE ELSE.
 DR. OZ: AND SHE HAD TOLD HIM
 THAT SHE HAD GOTTEN THE
 ILLNESS?
 THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD KNOW?
 WELL, WHETHER OR NOT SHE
 TOLD HIM, SHE ALLEGES THAT HE
 WOULD HAVE KNOWN FAITH --
 ALLEGES HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF
 IN FACT HE HAD IT AND GAVE IT
 TO SOMEONE ELSE.
 SO, YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOING TO
 BE A VERY INTERESTING AND
 IMPORTANT PART OF THE LAWSUIT.
 MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, THEY
 HAVE LEGAL RIGHTS AGAINST
 SOMEONE WHO GIVES THEM A
 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE.
 HERPES OR ANYONE ELSE, IF THAT
 PERSON KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE
 KNOWN THAT THEY HAD THAT
 DISEASE AND FAILED TO DISCLOSE
 IT.
 THAT'S WHY ONE OF THE CAUSES OF
 ACTION, DR. OZ, IN THE LAWSUIT
 IS IT'S CALLED FRAUD.
 FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT IF YOU
 DON'T MAKE THAT REPRESENTATION
 OR MISREPRESENT YOUR HEALTH
 CONDITION.
 I WAS REALLY TELLING MY
 PARENTS PROBABLY THE HARDEST
 THING THAT I HAD TO DO.
 SORRY.
 DR. OZ: THAT'S OK.
 I HATE CRYING ON CAMERA AND
 ALWAYS TELL MYSELF I'M NOT
 GOING TO CRY.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DOES YOUR MOM TELL
 YOU WHEN YOU TOLD HER?
 SHE WAS MORE IN SHOCK
 BECAUSE WHEN I TOLD HER, I TOLD
 HER EVERYTHING.
 NOT JUST THIS ONE THING.
 HEY, MOM, THIS IS WHAT I'VE
 BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST 11
 MONTHS.
 SO EVERYTHING, WE SAT MY DAD
 DOWN AND I TOLD MY DAD.
 OF COURSE, THEY WEREN'T HAPPY,
 YOU KNOW?
 IT'S WHY, FAITH?
 WE TAUGHT YOU BETTER.
 I KNEW BETTER.
 AND I KNEW I KNEW BETTER
 BECAUSE I FELT LIKE OK, THIS IS
 NOT SOMEBODY THAT I COULD EVEN
 BRING HOME, YOU KNOW?
 SO TO HAVE -- TO SIT DOWN AND
 ADMIT TO YOUR FATHER AND LOOK
 YOUR FATHER IN THE EYE, AND NO
 BUSINESS BEING WITH THAT --
 PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST
 EMBARRASSING FEELINGS.
 DR. OZ: IT TAKES A LOT TO DO
 WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
 ACCOMPLISH NOW IS VERY BRAVE.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: I'M GOING TO ASK THE
 QUESTION EVERYONE IS THINKING,
 WHY WOULD YOU PUT YOURSELF IN
 THE BULL'S EYE?
 WHY EXPOSE YOURSELF?
 YOU'VE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED
 THINGS THAT ARE VERY PRIVATE
 AND VERY SENSITIVE.
 AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING IT.
 BUT WHY NOT JUST GO HIDE?
 UH-HUH.
 I FEEL LIKE I DID TRY HIDING.
 AND IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.
 SO IF I HAVE TO EMBARRASS
 MYSELF, AND TO HELP SOMEBODY
 ELSE, I'M WILLING TO DO THAT.
 AND THIS SHOULD BE A
 TEACHING MOMENT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 BECAUSE TAKE A LESSON FROM WHAT
 FAITH JUST SAID.
 SO I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION,
 DR. OZ, WHAT DID HE PUT HIMSELF
 AS A 50 PLUS-YEAR-OLD MAN IN
 THIS POSITION WITH A
 19-YEAR-OLD AND WITH OTHER
 YOUNG WOMEN, SOME OF WHOM
 ALLEGEDLY WERE UNDER AGE, WHY
 DID HE DO WHAT HE'S ALLEGED TO
 HAVE DONE?
 WHY WON'T HE ACKNOWLEDGE IT?
 WHY WON'T HE TRY TO MAKE THINGS
 BETTER?
 THAT'S THE QUESTION WE NEED TO
 ASK ABOUT R. KELLY.
 INSTEAD, HIS -- DEFINITELY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: AND I HAVE NOT SEEN
 YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS.
 BUT I AM CURIOUS WHAT YOUR
 DOCTORS ARE ADVISING FOR YOU.
 UH-HUH.
 SO THEY HAVE SOME MEDICATION
 OUT THERE.
 I'M NOT REALLY TAKING IT, YOU
 KNOW, I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF BY
 EATING RIGHT, KEEPING MY STRESS
 DOWN, SO THERE'S -- AND A LOT
 OF PEOPLE HAD ASKED ME OR
 ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD A
 LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SHARED THE
 SAME DISEASE AS ME WHO HAVE
 GIVEN ME TIPS WHO HAVE DONE
 THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED ME TO
 WHERE I CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE
 WHICH THAT'S WHY -- THAT'S WHY
 I CAN COME ON HERE AND PUT MY
 FACE NEXT TO THIS UGLY S.T.D.
 AND SAY IT'S OK.
 YOU KNOW?
 BUT SHE'S ALSO -- YEAH.
 THAT'S FANTASTIC.
 I'M JUST GOING TO SAY SHE DID
 TAKE A TEST PRIOR TO THE
 LAWSUIT ALLEGES PRIOR TO BEING
 INVOLVED WITH MR. KELLY.
 AND SHE WAS CLEAN.
 SHE HAD NO S.T.D.
 DR. OZ: AND TAKING THE TEST --
 I CAN TELL YOU WHY I TOOK
 THE TEST.
 I WAS ON BIRTH CONTROL, THE
 DEPO SHOT AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
 YOU GO EVERY THREE MONTHS.
 IF YOU'RE GOING TO THE RIGHT
 DOCTOR, THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK
 YOU FOR S.T.D.'S, FOR
 PREGNANCY.
 SO EVERY THREE MONTHS, I WAS
 GETTING TESTED.
 DR. OZ: LET'S GET INTO THE
 LEGAL ISSUES A TINY BIT.
 WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS FOR R.
 KELLY?
 YOU BROUGHT LEGAL ACTION
 AGAINST HIM.
 THERE'S A LAWSUIT PENDING ON
 BEHALF OF FAITH, AGAINST MR.
 KELLY.
 HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER
 IT.
 IF HE DOESN'T ANSWER IT, THEN
 IT'S POSSIBLE TO TAKE HIS
 DEFAULT.
 ASSUMING HE'S PROPERLY SERVED.
 AND I THINK HE SHOULD ANSWER
 IT.
 AND LET HIM PUT FORTH ALL OF
 HIS DEFENSES IF HE HAS ANY, WE
 HAVE YET TO SEE THEM.
 DR. OZ: SO IN THE MEANTIME,
 YOU'VE BEEN GETTING OTHER NOTES
 FROM HIM, AND THIS IS A LETTER
 THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU RECEIVED
 FROM R. KELLY'S LEGAL TEAM
 THREATENING RETALIATION AGAINST
 FAITH.
 AND I GATHER YOU HAVE SEEN THIS
 NOTE?
 RIGHT.
 DR. OZ: MAY I READ IT TO THE
 AUDIENCE?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: IT SAYS IN PART PLEASE
 ADVISE MS. RODGERS, FAITH, YOUR
 CLIENT TO ABANDON THIS
 HEARTLESS EFFORT TO TRY TO
 DESTROY MY MUSICAL LEGACY FOR
 SELFISH ENRICHMENT.
 IF SHE PERSISTS IN COURT SHE
 WILL BE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC
 OPINION DURING THE DISCOVERY
 PROCESS.
 IF MS. RODGERS CARES ABOUT HER
 OWN REPUTATION SHE SHOULD CEASE
 HER PARTICIPATION AND
 ORGANIZATION WITH THE
 ORGANIZERS OF THIS NEGATIVE
 CAMPAIGN.
 FAITH, WHAT'S IT LIKE SEEING
 THOSE WORDS NOW?
 WHAT'S IT LIKE READING THAT THE
 FIRST TIME?
 THE FIRST TIME IT DEFINITELY
 I WAS LIKE HEART -- BUT I HAVE
 TO REALIZE WHO I'M DEALING
 WITH.
 SO NOW RARINGD IT NOW --
 READING IT NOW IT'S COMICAL TO
 ME.
 DR. OZ: COMICAL?
 COMICAL BECAUSE IT'S A JOKE.
 IT'S A LIE.
 I DON'T NEED PERSONAL
 ENRICHMENT.
 I COME FROM A FAMILY OF HARD
 WORKING PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN
 NOTHING BUT PROVIDED FOR ME.
 SO TO SAY I'M DOING THIS FOR MY
 OWN PERSONAL GAIN, LIKE LET'S
 BE CLEAR, WHEN HE WAS SEEING
 ME, HE WOULD ASK ME WHO'S
 BUYING THAT?
 SO I NEVER NEEDED YOU FOR
 ANYTHING.
 I READ NEWS REPORTS THAT HE
 DENIED HE SENT THAT LETTER.
 BUT ANYWAY, IT WAS SENT AFTER
 THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED.
 BUT THE POINT IS THIS.
 WE DO FEEL THAT THERE HAS BEEN
 RETALIATION.
 AND ATTEMPTS TO INTIMIDATE
 FAITH FROM PROCEEDING.
 AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE
 INTIMIDATED.
 SHE IS -- SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN
 THIS CASE, THE POWER OF MR.
 KELLY AND SHE HAS STRONG
 SUPPORT FOR HER PARENTS, STRONG
 SUPPORT FROM HER LAWYERS.
 AND WE'RE GOING FORWARD.
 AND THE FACT THAT HE'S A
 CELEBRITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE
 IS ABOVE THE LAW.
 IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE HAS A
 LICENSE TO GO AND HURT PEOPLE.
 ANY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE DOES.
 SO THAT'S WHY SHE IS
 PROCEEDING.
 AND YOU CAN SEE DR. OZ HOW
 PAINFUL IT IS FOR HER, YOU
 KNOW, TO HAVE TO EVEN TALK
 ABOUT THIS.
 BUT SHE IS ONE COURAGEOUS YOUNG
 WOMAN.
 AND I APPLAUD HER FOR IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: UP NEXT, CAN MORE WOMEN
 BE AT RISK AND WHAT CAN PARENTS
 DO TO PREBT THEIR DAUGHTERS?
 A PLEA YOU HAVE TO HEAR.
 THAT IS NEXT.
 [APPLAUSE]
      When you feed yourself            some oats,
  the oats feed your body fiber.
     Fiber helps keep things   moving through your system.
         Which is great.
     Because when you're good         to your system,
      it'll be good to you.
          Ok I'll admit.
     I didn't keep my place     as clean as I would like
      'cuz I'm way too busy.
 Who's got the time to chase around down dirt, dust and hair?
             So now,
     I use Heavy Duty Swiffer     Sweeper and Dusters.
    For hard-to-reach places,
  Duster makes it easy to clean.
 It captures dust in one swipe.
           Ha! Gotcha!
                And (New) Sweeper                Heavy Duty cloths
             lock away a twice as             much dirt and dust.
  It gets stuff deep in the  grooves other tools can miss.
          You know what?
 My place is a lot cleaner now.
          Stop cleaning.
        Start Swiffering.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE'RE BACK IN A DAYTIME
 EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH FAITH
 RODGERS WHO CLAIMS R. KELLY
 INTENTIONALLY INFECTED HER WITH
 HERPES.
 WOMEN'S RIGHTS ATTORNEY GLORIA
 ALLRED IS BACK WITH US.
 AND I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE
 FAITH'S MOTHER, KELLY, AND HER
 DAD, CHARLES.
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOUR DAUGHTER REFLECTED VERY
 WELL ON BOTH OF YOU.
 AND SHE'S SPOKE ABOUT THE
 VALUES THAT YOU TAUGHT HER.
 SO I'M SURE THIS WAS DIFFICULT
 FOR ANY PARENT TO HEAR.
 BUT IN PARTICULAR FOR YOU,
 BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO TELL HER
 TO GO IN DIFFERENT ROADS THAN
 YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS ON.
 KELLY, HOW HAS IT BEEN FOR YOU
 HOPING WITH THE NEWS FROM WHAT
 YOU'VE BEEN HEARING?
 I HAVE JUST REALLY BEEN
 TRYING TO STAY VERY PRAYERFUL.
 IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU
 WATCH YOUR DAUGHTER ON A DAILY
 BASIS BEING DISCUSSED IN A
 NEGATIVE MANNER.
 BUT WE STAND WITH HER.
 IN THIS SITUATION.
 AND WE'RE JUST --
 [APPLAUSE]
 WE'RE JUST GOING TO STAND WITH
 HER AND SUPPORT HER AND GUIDE
 HER THROUGH THIS.
 DR. OZ: WHY DON'T YOU -- WHAT
 DID YOU TELL HER WHEN SHE FIRST
 OPENED UP TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HAD
 HAPPENED?
 I LET HER KNOW THAT I LOVED
 HER.
 THAT WAS THE FIRST THING.
 AND THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
 ASHAMED, THAT WE'VE ALL MADE
 SOME MISTAKES AND THAT WE WOULD
 GET THROUGH THIS.
 AND THAT WE LOVED HER NO MATTER
 WHAT.
 IT WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE.
 IT DOESN'T CHANGE TODAY.
 IT HASN'T CHANGED.
 DR. OZ: DO YOU FEEL THAT LOVE?
 I DO.
 DR. OZ: THAT'S IMPORTANT.
 SO DAD, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY
 TO R. KELLY?
 WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO HEAR?
 WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO HIM IS
 PROBABLY BE RESPONSIBLE.
 BE ACCOUNTABLE.
 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS BEHAVIOR
 IS NOT NORMAL.
 AND THAT HE HAS DAMAGED SOME
 WOMEN.
 STOP USING YOUR CELEBRITY AS
 BAIT.
 YOU KNOW, HE HAS TO ANSWER TO
 GOD, YOU KNOW?
 BECAUSE HE HAS THE FINAL SAY IN
 EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?
 AND I THINK HE --
 [APPLAUSE]
 AND I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, THE
 GOD THAT LOVES US ALL LOVES
 HIM.
 YOU KNOW, WE ALL HAVE SINNED.
 WE ALL HAVE FAILED IN DIFFERENT
 TIMES IN OUR LIFE.
 AND SO THAT PART OF ME IS --
 HAS SOME EMPATHY FOR HIM, SOME
 SYMPATHY FOR HIM.
 HOWEVER, THERE'S ANOTHER PART
 OF ME THAT IS -- YOU KNOW, THE
 DAD PART OF ME, THE MAN PART OF
 ME IS ANGRY.
 AT TIMES I HAVE DIFFERENT
 THOUGHTS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: UNCHRISTIAN THOUGHTS.
 RIGHT.
 UNCHRISTIAN THOUGHTS.
 I DO.
 BUT I KNOW THAT THE GOD PART OF
 ME, YOU KNOW, BRINGS ME BACK
 INTO CHARACTER.
 AND THAT'S BECAUSE CHARLES
 IS A PASTOR.
 AND SO I THINK HE'S GOT THE
 PAST I DON'T RECALL -- THE
 PASTORAL APPROACH.
 SOMETIMES CONFLICTING WITH THE
 DAD APPROACH.
 MY MESSAGE IS YES, MR. KELLY,
 YOU SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE TO
 GOD.
 BUT IN ADDITION, YOU NEED TO BE
 ACCOUNTABLE IN THE JUSTICE
 SYSTEM BECAUSE WE NEED JUSTICE
 FOR FAITH.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: FAITH, WHAT DO YOU WANT
 TO SAY TO R. KELLY IF HE
 WATCHES THIS?
 AND A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE HE
 WILL.
 I WOULD TELL HIM I FORGIVE
 YOU.
 I ALREADY FORGAVE YOU A LONG
 TIME AGO.
 I NEED YOU TO STOP WHAT YOU'RE
 DOING.
 I NEED YOU TO JUST FREE
 YOURSELF AND FREE THESE YOUNG
 LADIES.
 THEY MAY NOT BE -- THEY MAY NOT
 -- EXCUSE ME.
 THEY MAY NOT BE KIDNAPPED.
 THEY MAY NOT BE HELD AGAINST
 THEIR WILL.
 BUT THEY'RE IN A TOXIC
 SITUATION THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN
 SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE
 OUTSIDE WORLD.
 AND THAT'S SCARY.
 AND TO KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT,
 I'VE SEEN IT AFFECT ME AND I'VE
 SEEN IT AFFECT MY PARENTS.
 SO IT'S -- IT'S A AFFECTING
 EVERYBODY.
 NOW YOU NEED TO BE AFFECTED.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE REACHED OUT TO R.
 KELLY'S LEGAL TEAM ASKING ABOUT
 THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HE
 KNOWINGLY INFLICTED WOMEN WITH
 AN S.T.D.
 AND WE DID NOT GET A RESPONSE
 IN TIME FOR THIS TAPING.
 WE ARE STAYING ON TOP OF THIS
 STORY.
 AND AS DEVELOPMENTS UNFOLD WE
 WILL UPDATE OUR VIEWER IF WE
 HEAR CONFLICTING FROM R.
 KELLY'S TEAM.
 I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY
 MUCH.
 I KNOW HOW HARD THIS WAS.
 MOM AND DAD FOR COMING ON, FOR
 SUPPORTING THESE WONDERFUL
 WOMEN AND YOU BEING BRAVE AND
 GLORIA AS WELL FOR BEING IN
 CHARGE.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
