 THANKS FOR WATCHING.
 OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES.
 GOOD EVENING.
 JOHN BERMAN HERE FOR ANDERSON.
 AND WE BEGIN WITH THIS BREAKING
 NEWS.
 DID THE PRESIDENT JUST THREATEN
 TO BLOCK THE RELEASE OF THE
 MUELLER REPORT?
 WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT
 DEPENDING ON HOW YOU READ WHAT
 HE JUST WROTE, HE MIGHT HAVE.
 A LITTLE BACKGROUND FIRST.
 THIS AFTERNOON IN A LETTER TO
 CONGRESS ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL
 BARR SAID THE MUELLER REPORT
 WILL BE READY FOR RELEASE BY
 MID-APRIL IF NOT SOONER.
 THAT FULL REPORT IS NEARLY 400
 PAGES EXCLUDING TABLES AND
 APPENDICES.
 THAT WAS MID-AFTERNOON.
 JUST MINUTES AGO THE PRESIDENT,
 THE SAME PRESIDENT WHO OVER THE
 PAST WEEK HAS SAID HE'S FOR THE
 FULL RELEASE OF THE REPORT WROTE
 THIS.
 ROBERT MUELLER WAS A HERO TO THE
 RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS UNTIL HE
 RULED THAT THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA, SO
 RIDICULOUS TO EVEN SAY, AFTER
 MORE THAN TWO YEARS SINCE THE
 INSURANCE POLICY STATEMENT WAS
 MADE BY A DIRTY COP, I GOT THE
 ANSWERS I WANTED, THE TRUTH.
 THE PROBLEM IS NO MATTER WHAT
 THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS GET,
 NO MATTER WHAT WE GIVE THEM, IT
 WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH.
 JUST WATCH.
 THEY WILL HARASS AND COMPLAIN
 AND RESIST, THE THEME OF THEIR
 MOVEMENT, SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
 JUST TAKE OUR VICTORY AND SAY
 NO.
 WE'VE GOT A COUNTRY TO RUN.
 SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TAKE OUR
 VICTORY AND SAY NO?
 WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN?
 IS HE NOW THREATENING TO BLOCK
 THE RELEASE OF THE REPORT OR IS
 HE JUST BROADLY SAYING NO TO
 WHAT HE CALLS THE HARASSMENT AND
 COMPLAINING?
 HONESTLY, WE DON'T KNOW.
 WE'RE ASKING, BUT WE DON'T HAVE
 AN ANSWER AS OF YET.
 WE ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE
 NEARLY 400 PAGES OF THE REPORT.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S IN
 THEM.
 THE WHITE HOUSE AND FELLOW
 REPUBLICANS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN
 THEM.
 IN FACT, BARR TOLD CONGRESS IN
 THAT LETTER THAT HE HAS NO PLANS
 TO SHARE THE REPORT WITH THE
 WHITE HOUSE BEFORE IT'S MADE
 PUBLIC, OR SHOULD WE SAY BEFORE
 MORE OF IT IS MADE PUBLIC.
 IN FACT, AS OF NOW BARR REVEALED
 74 WORDS FROM MUELLER'S REPORT
 IN THAT FOUR-PAGE SUMMARY.
 74 WORDS EXCLUDING A SINGLE
 FOOTNOTE AND THE TITLE OF THE
 REPORT.
 IF YOU INCLUDE ALL OF THAT IT
 JUMPS TO A WHOPPING 101 WORDS.
 YES, THOSE WORDS DO INCLUDE THE
 FACT THAT MUELLER DOES NOT THINK
 THERE IS A CRIMINAL CASE FOR
 COORDINATION OR CONSPIRACY, BUT
 101 WORDS OUT OF 400 PAGES
 LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM FOR
 POSSIBILITIES.
 DO THE 400 PAGES EXONERATE THE
 PRESIDENT AS HE'S BEEN CLAIMING
 FOR THE PAST FIVE DAYS SINCE WE
 RECEIVED THE BARR SUMMARY?
 OR DO THE 400 PAGES REVEAL
 DETAILS ABOUT KEY EVENTS ABSENT
 FROM IT?
 DETAILS LIKE WHAT MR. MUELLER'S
 TEAM FOUND OUT ABOUT THE TRUMP
 TOWER MEETING.
 DETAILS LIKE WHAT THEY LEARNED
 ABOUT THE COVER-UP AND LIES
 ABOUT THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING.
 DETAILS LIKE WHAT THEY LEARNED
 ABOUT THE TRUMP SCOW
 PROJECT THAT THE PRESIDENT
 PURSUED UNTIL THE END OF HIS
 CANDIDACY BUT DENIED EVER DOING.
 DETAILS LIKE WHAT THEY LEARNED
 ABOUT THE OVAL OFFICE MEETING
 WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SERGEY
 KISLYAK.
 DETAILS LIKE WHY THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL SPECIFICALLY DID NOT
 EXONERATE THE PRESIDENT ON
 THE QUESTION OF OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE.
 THE REPORT WILL COME OUT,
 ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR SAYS, ONCE
 THE DOJ IS FINISHED SCRUBBING
 THE REPORT OF SENSITIVE
 INTELLIGENCE AND ONGOING LEGAL
 MATTERS.
 AND THEY'RE GETTING HELP WITH
 THOSE RETRACTIONS FROM THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL HIMSELF.
 MEANWHILE, DEMOCRATS ARE
 DEMANDING THAT BARR STICK TO THE
 DEADLINE THEY SET FOR THE
 RELEASE OF THE REPORT WITHOUT
 REDACTIONS.
 THAT DEADLINE IS TUESDAY, APRIL
 2nd.
 NOW, THE NEWS ON ALL OF THIS
 BROKE LATE THIS AFTERNOON JUST
 BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SET
 TO TALK TO THE PRESS, SO THERE
 IS REACTION FROM HIM ON CAMERA
 AND THEN THERE'S THAT TWEET HE
 JUST SENT OUT.
 CNN'S KAITLIN COLLINS JOINS US
 NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WITH
 THE DETAILS.
 IS THERE ANY SENSE AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANS
 WITH THIS STATEMENT OF SAYING NO
 MAYBE TO THE RELEASE OF THE FULL
 REPORT?
 Reporter: SO FAR, JOHN, WE
 HAVEN'T GOTTEN A LOT OF CLARITY.
 IF YOU READ THROUGH THE
 PRESIDENT'S TWEET, THE BEGINNING
 OF IT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT HE'S
 BEEN SAYING THE LAST SEVERAL
 DAYS, BUT IT'S THAT LAST
 SENTENCE RIGHT THERE AT THE
 END THAT REALLY CATCHES YOUR EYE
 WHERE HE SAYS MAYBE WE SHOULD
 JUST TAKE OUR VICTORY AND SAY
 NO.
 THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAVE
 PEOPLE TALKING OVER THE NEXT FEW
 DAYS, WONDERING WHAT IT IS THE
 PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO SAY THERE
 BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
 EXPLICIT.
 JOHN, ONE THING IT COULD BE IS
 THAT LETTER FROM THE HOUSE
 JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN, JERRY
 NADLER, IN RESPONSE TO BILL BARR
 EARLIER TODAY WHERE HE
 ESSENTIALLY REFUTED EVERYTHING
 BARR SAID IN HIS LETTER.
 HE SAID HE DIDN'T AGREE WITH
 WHEN BARR SAID THAT LETTER WAS
 GOING TO MAKE IT TO CONGRESS.
 HE DIDN'T AGREE TO THE FACT
 THERE WERE GOING TO BE
 REDACTIONS IN IT.
 AND HE DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN BARR
 SAID HE WOULD COME TESTIFY IN
 MAY AND NADLER SAID HE WANTED
 HIM TO COME TESTIFY NOW.
 SO THAT COULD BE PART OF WHAT
 THE PRESIDENT IS REFERRING TO.
 BUT ALSO IN THE LAST SEVERAL
 DAYS, I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL OF
 THE PRESIDENT'S ALLIES WHO HAVE
 BEEN TOUTING BARR'S SUMMARY ON
 SUNDAY SAYING THAT IT'S A
 VICTORY FOR THE PRESIDENT.
 BUT THEY'RE ALSO A LITTLE BIT
 WORRIED ABOUT THE FULL REPORT
 COMING OUT, ALL 400 PAGES.
 NOT THAT IT'S GOING TO EXPOSE
 THE PRESIDENT LEGALLY OR
 CRIMINALLY TO ANYTHING, BUT THEY
 FEAR IT COULD BE POLITICALLY
 DAMAGING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 YOU KNOW, IT IS INTERESTING
 BECAUSE EARLIER TODAY IN PUBLIC
 THE PRESIDENT DID SEEM TO DEFER
 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN TERMS
 OF THE REPORT'S RELEASE,
 CORRECT?
 Reporter: TOTALLY.
 HE WAS SPEAKING WITH REPORTERS
 IN PALM BEACH.
 THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE
 BREAKING NEWS FROM BILL BARR
 ABOUT SENDING THIS REDACTED
 REPORT TO CONGRESS WITHIN A
 MATTER OF WEEKS.
 THE PRESIDENT SEEMED PRETTY
 ONBOARD WITH WHAT BARR HAD SAID.
 I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 IF THAT'S WHAT HE'D LIKE TO DO,
 I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.
 THIS WAS A HOAX.
 THIS WAS A WITCH HUNT.
 I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO
 HIDE.
 I THINK A LOT OF THINGS ARE
 COMING OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE
 OTHER SIDE.
 BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE
 IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 Reporter: NOW, WE SHOULD NOTE
 THAT IN BARR'S LETTER TODAY HE
 SAID THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT
 GOING TO GET THEIR HANDS ON A
 COPY OF THIS REDACTED REPORT
 UNTIL IT'S IN LAWMAKERS' HANDS
 AS WELL.
 HE SAID IN THAT LETTER THE WHITE
 HOUSE HAS THE RIGHT TO ASSERT
 ANY EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BUT
 SINCE THE PRESIDENT HAS PUBLICLY
 DEFERRED TO HIM AS HE DID THERE
 ON CAMERA, THAT BARR IS GOING TO
 BE THE ONE MAKING THOSE
 DECISIONS.
 SO, JOHN, THE QUESTION IS, IS
 BARR GOING TO TRY TO ASSERT SOME
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FOR ANY
 CONVERSATIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT
 HAS HAD THAT IS IN THAT REPORT?
 WE'LL PUT THAT QUESTION TO
 SOME OF OUR BEST LEGAL MINDS IN
 JUST A MOMENT.
 KAITLIN COLLINS, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH.
 JOINING US FROM "THE NEW YORK
 TIMES," MAGGIE HABERMAN, ALSO A
 CNN POLITICAL ANALYST.
 AND SOMETHING OF A TRUMP HUMAN
 DECODER RING.
 MAGGIE, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH
 US.
 THIS LATEST STATEMENT FROM THE
 PRESIDENT, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
 SAY NO.
 I HAVE A HARD TIVING
 THAT THIS IS A REAL, LITERAL,
 GENUINE THREAT TO BLOCK THE
 RELEASE OF THE MUELLER REPORT.
 IS THIS JUST MORE OF, "A," HIM
 MESSING WITH PEOPLE ON A FRIDAY
 NIGHT BECAUSE HE CAN?
 OR, "B," SORT OF MOVING THE BAR,
 NO PUN INTENDED, SO THE PART OF
 THE REPORT THAT DOES GET
 RELEASED BY BARR, HE CAN SAY,
 LOOK, WE'RE BEING COMPLETELY
 TRANSPARENT.
 I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.
 IT COULD BE ALL OF THE ABOVE.
 I THINK SOME OF THESE TWEETS OF
 HIS WHERE THERE'S NOT MUCH
 UTILITY IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
 WHAT THE MOTIVE IS.
 IN THIS ONE HE COULD BE TROLLING
 THE PRESS VERY SUCCESSFULLY
 RIGHT NOW, HE COULD BE REACTING
 TO TELEVISION COVERAGE WHICH HE
 OFTEN DOES, OR HE COULD INDEED
 BE THINKING, AND I TEND TO THINK
 IT'S A LITTLE LESS THAT, THAT
 HE'S SETTING THE BAR AT A
 DIFFERENT POINT.
 LOOK, I UNDERSTAND WHY THE WHITE
 HOUSE FEELS VERY GOOD OVER THE
 PAST WEEK AND THEY'RE DOING
 EXACTLY WHAT I THINK THAT THEIR
 POLITICAL OPPONENTS WOULD
 PROBABLY DO IN THE SAME
 SITUATION, WHICH IS SAY, LOOK,
 THIS EXONERATES -HE'S CLEARED.
 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 BEING CLEARED CRIMINALLY AND A
 POLITICAL PROBLEM.
 THIS REPORT IS A POTENTIAL
 POLITICAL PROBLEM.
 HE SAID VERY CLEARLY IN THAT
 VIDEO, I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.
 SO IF HE'S SAYING THAT, BARR IS
 GOING THROUGH IT FOR GRAND JURY
 TESTIMONY, SOURCES AND METHODS,
 THINGS LIKE THAT.
 BARR CAN FLAG AREAS OF POTENTIAL
 PRIVILEGE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING
 IS HE CAN'T EXERT PRIVILEGE.
 HE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF HE TALKS
 TO THE PRESIDENT.
 AND THAT'S UP TO THE PRESIDENT.
 WE'LL TALK TO OUR LAWYERS
 COMING UP ABOUT THAT.
 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL COULD WITHHOLD THINGS
 BETHE PRESIDENT MIGHT
 ASSERT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AT
 SOME POINT, LIKE WE SEE IN
 CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS.
 I DO WANT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE
 KAITLIN SAID SOME OF HER
 REPORTING IS A SENkLITTLE
 TREPIDATION ABOUT THE UNKNOWN,
 ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE IN THESE 400
 PAGES.
 WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ON THAT
 FRONT?
 EXACTLY THAT.
 AS TIME HAS GONE ON, THERE IS A
 RECOGNITION THAT I THINK THE
 INITIAL HIGH OF THE SUMMARY FROM
 LAST SUNDAY HAS WORN OFF A BIT.
 YOU SAW TODAY THAT BARR SENT
 EITHER SOME NOTE OR MADE A
 STATEMENT THAT THIS WAS REALLY
 JUST TOP LINE FINDINGS, FOLKS.
 THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
 INDICATIVE OF THE ENTIRE REPORT.
 I THINK AS TIME IS GOING ON,
 FOLKS AROUND THE PRESIDENT ARE
 BECOMING MORE AWARE OF THE FACT
 THAT THERE COULD BE THINGS THAT
 ARE POLITICALLY DAMAGING IN
 HERE.
 IT MAY TURN OUT THAT THERE ISN'T
 MUCH, BUT AT 300 TO 400 PAGES
 THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT DON'T
 INCLUDE THE INDICTMENTS OR
 PIECES OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS
 GOING TO BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF
 INFORMATION THERE.ACTLY WHAT TH
 REFLECTS ON THE PRESIDENT
 REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT THEY
 DON'T KNOW EITHER.
 SO, THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE
 AHEAD OF THEMSELVES ON SOME OF
 WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND TRYING
 TO GET THE HEADLINES THEY WANT.
 POLITICALLY, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
 THEY'RE TRYING TO MUDDY THE
 WATERS ON THIS BEFORE IT ALL
 COMES OUT.
 WHAT IS THE OPINION RIGHT NOW
 THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS OF HIS
 ATTORNEY GENERAL?
 YOU GET THE SENSE THAT HE'S HIS
 FAVORITE PERSON ON EARTH AT THE
 CURRENT MOMENT.
 THE PRESIDENT'S ESTIMATION OF
 PEOPLE CAN CHANGE PRETTY
 QUICKLY, AS YOU KNOW.
 I THINK THAT HE WAS VERY HAPPY
 WITH THE LETTER THAT CAME OUT ON
 SUNDAY.
 HE WAS VERY HAPPY THAT THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL INSERTED
 HIMSELF INTO THIS IN TERMS OF
 SAYING THERE'S NO OBSTRUCTION
 IN THE A.G. RULES.
 I THINK DEPENDING ON WHAT
 HAPPENS WITH THIS REPORT, WE
 WILL SEE HOW HAPPY HE IS.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE
 PRESIDENT BOTH CLAIM THERE'S A
 SEPARATION, THAT THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL IS DOING THIS COMPLETELY
 ON HIS OWN.
 AND THEY NEED THAT TO BE THE
 VIEW, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE IS
 GOING TO BE A PERCEPTION -IT
 MAY NOT BE REAL BUT THERE WILL
 BE A PERCEPTION BY SOME THAT THE
 WHITE HOUSE GOT INVOLVED AND
 PERHAPS MUCKED AROUND WITH IT.
 BARR IS ALREADY GETTING A LOT OF
 CRITICISM FOR HAVING TAKEN THE
 MUELLER REPORT FURTHER THAN
 MUELLER SEEMS TO HAVE.
 ANY EVIDENCE IT'S NOT
 COMPLETELY ON HIS OWN, AND "B,"
 DOES THE WHITE HOUSE TRUST HIM
 TO DO IT ON HIS OWN?
 I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE DOES
 TRUST HIM TO DO IT ON HIS OWN.
 I THINK THEY THINK VERY HIGHLY
 OF BILL BARR.
 I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL'S OFFICE HAS A GOOD
 RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
 THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE
 FROM ANYTHING I KNOW RIGHT NOW
 THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF
 EXCHANGES GOING ON ABOUT THE
 INFORMATION.
 BUT WE HAVE ANOTHER IT SOUNDS
 LIKE TWO WEEKS UNTIL WE SEE
 THIS, SO WHO KNOWS WHAT'S
 HAPPENING.
 MAGGIE, STAND BY IF YOU WILL.
 I WANT TO BRING IN JOHN DEAN,
 ALSO CNN LEGAL ANALYST SHAN WU
 WHO BRIEFLY DEFENDED RICK GATES
 WHEN HE WAS INDICTED BY THE
 MUELLER TEAM.
 JOHN, LET ME START WITH YOU ON
 THE QUESTION MAGGIE AND I WERE
 DISCUSSING THERE.
 WE WERE TOLD THE WHITE HOUSE
 WILL NOT SEE THIS BEFORE BARR
 RELEASES IT.
 IT WOULD BE THE WHITE HOUSE WHO
 WOULD HAVE TO TECHNICALLY ASSERT
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
 BUT WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF
 WHAT WILLIAM BARR COULD DO HERE?
 COULD HE IDENTIFY AREAS AND KEEP
 THEM REDACTED BECAUSE OF THE
 POSSIBILITY THAT EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE MIGHT COVER THEM?
 HE COULD THEORETICALLY DO
 THAT.
 I KNOW OF NO INSTANCE WHERE A
 PRESIDENT HAS DELEGATED OR TRIED
 TO DELEGATE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE
 RIGHTS AND POWERS.
 SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING
 ABOUT IS, ARE THERE THINGS THAT
 ARE GOING TO COME UP IN THE
 REPORT THAT WERE GIVEN UNDER THE
 CONDITION BY THE WHITE HOUSE
 WHERE THEY PROVIDED DOCUMENTS TO
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AND THEY
 SAID THEY WERE RESERVING THE
 RIGHT TO INVOKE EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE.
 WILL BARR FLAG THAT AND WITHHOLD
 IT FOR SOME REASON UNTIL THE
 PRESIDENT DOES OR DOES NOT
 INVOKE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE?
 SO, SHAN --
 THAT'S THE ISSUE.
 WE KNOW THAT WILLIAM BARR IS
 AN ACCOMPLISHED LAWYER.
 I THINK THERE'S BEEN EVIDENCE
 OVER THIS LAST WEEK THAT HE'S A
 SHREWD POLITICAL PLAYER AS WELL.
 I DON'T MEAN THAT PEJORATIVELY.
 BUT THE MERE FACT THAT THIS
 REPORT IS 400 PAGES, NEARLY, AND
 WE LEARNED THAT TODAY OFFICIALLY
 FROM HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME.
 THERE'S NO REASON HE COULD NOT
 HAVE TOLD US THAT LAST FRIDAY
 HAD HE WANTED TO, CORRECT?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO GET
 THAT PAGE COUNT OUT.
 HE'S NOT IN THE REALM RIGHT NOW
 WHERE HE'S CONFINED BY LEGAL
 REQUIREMENTS, SO IT VERY MUCH IS
 HIM EXERCISING HIS DISCRETION.
 ONE OF THE POINTS JOHN JUST
 RAISED IS QUITE FASCINATING.
 ONE OF THE GREAT UNKNOWNS IS, WE
 DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
 CONDITIONS THERE WERE WITH
 REGARD TO INFORMATION TURNED
 OVER BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO HIM.
 IN FACT, WE DON'T KNOW MUCH
 ABOUT WHAT HE PROMISED WITH
 REGARD TO THE PRESIDENT'S
 WRITTEN ANSWERS AS WELL.
 ALL THAT HAS GIVEN BARR AN
 ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DISCRETION.
 AND HE APPEARS VERY UNAFRAID TO
 USE THAT DISCRETION, JOHN.
 HE LISTED FOUR AREAS, SHAN,
 WHERE HE WOULD REDACT OR
 WITHHOLD MATERIAL IN THESE 400
 PAGES.
 GRAND JURY TESTIMONY,
 INTELLIGENCE TESTIMONY, ALSO
 ONGOING LEGAL INVESTIGATIONS AND
 NUMBER FOUR, I WANT MORE
 EXPLANATION ON.
 INFORMATION THAT WOULD UNDULY
 INFRINGE ON THE PERSONAL PRIVACY
 AND REPUTATIONAL INTERESTS OF
 PERIPHERAL THIRD PARTIES.
 THAT MIGHT BE AN AREA WHERE
 THERE IS WIDE DISCRETION.
 I WOULD IMAGINE SOME ARGUMENT,
 SHAN.
 OH, YES, THAT IS A AREA OF
 VERY WIDE DISCRETION.
 THAT'S LIKE HIS SAFETY NET THERE
 FOR WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE THE MUELLER
 REPORT IS WHAT WE CALL A
 PROSECUTION MEMO.
 AND THAT'S GOING TO RELY HEAVILY
 ON THE GRAND JURY INFORMATION.
 USUALLY THERE'S TONS AND TONS OF
 QUOTES FROM THAT IN THE
 ANALYSIS.
 IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TO GET
 RID OF THE GRAND JURY TESTIMONY.
 IT'S QUITE EASY.
 ANYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE THE
 GRAND JURY.
 IF HE TAKES THAT OUT OF THE
 EQUATION, NOT TOO MUCH LEFT.
 HE TAKES OUT CLASSIFIED, NOT TOO
 MUCH LEFT.
 SOURCES, TECHNIQUES, NOW YOU'VE
 GOT REALLY SMALL AMOUNTS.
 IF HE THEN EXERCISES THIS LAST
 ONE, WHICH HE THINKS IS
 SENSITIVE MATERIAL IN HIS
 JUDGMENT, YOU COULD BE LOOKING
 AT JUST PAGES AND PAGES OF BLANK
 PAGES.
 THERE'S A LITTLE BRISTLING IN
 HERE, TOO, MAGGIE, IN THIS NEW
 LETTER FROM WILLIAM BARR WHERE
 HE SAYS IT'S BEEN
 MISCHARACTERIZED THAT HIS
 FOUR PAGES WERE A SUMMARY.
 HE'S NOW SAYING IT WASN'T A
 SUMMARY, IT WAS PRINCIPAL
 CONCLUSIONS.
 HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T LIKE HOW
 THIS IS BEING PORTRAYED.
 I DON'T THINK THAT THE FIVE
 DAYS OF COVERAGE THAT HAVE BEEN
 SUGGESTING THAT HE BASICALLY
 PRESENTED A FINDING BEFORE
 ANYBODY HAS SEEN THE REPORT,
 ANYBODY OUTSIDE OF THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT HAS SEEN THE REPORT,
 I THINK THAT SEEMS TO HAVE
 BOTHERED HIM.
 AGAIN, I THINK THIS ALL -I
 DON'T KNOW, TO BE CLEAR, I
 REALLY WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT
 WHAT WE DO NOTW, WHICH IS A
 LOT.
 WEAT'S IN THIS
 REPORT.
 BUT SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
 AFTER HIS INITIAL LETTER TO
 CONGRESS LAST SUNDAY, IT
 INDICATES TO ME THAT HE WANTS TO
 AT LEAST PREPARE THE PUBLIC OR
 CONGRESS FOR THE FACT THAT THERE
 MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW, SORT OF MORE
 NUANCED PORTRAYALS, SHALL WE
 SAY, IN THE REPORT THAN JUST
 SAYING THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF
 CONSPIRACY AND A LACK OF
 EXONERATION OR A CHARGE ON
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, BUT I'VE
 DECIDED NO OBSTRUCTION.
 HE WANTS TO PREPARE US FOR
 THAT NOW.
 WHERE ONE WEEK AGO HAD HE TOLD
 THE PUBLIC THERE WERE 400 PAGES
 THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A
 DIFFERENT RESPONSE.
 THAT IS ONE AREA WHERE I
 THINK THERE IS A LEGITIMATE
 CRITICISM, WHY THEY COULDN'T SAY
 THAT OUT FRONT.
 I DO THINK BARR WAS IN A DAMNED
 IF HE DID, DAMNED IF HE DIDN'T
 POSITION OVER THE WEEKEND.
 HE GOT CRITICIZED OF JUST TAKING
 48 HOURS.
 IF HE DIDN'T, HE WOULD BE
 ACCUSED OF MEDDLING AROUND.
 I DON'T THINK HE HAD A WIN-WIN
 THERE.
 BUT I DO THINK THAT IN TERMS OF
 JUST PREPARING PEOPLE FOR AS
 MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCOPE
 OF THIS, I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE
 BEEN WISE.
 JOHN DEAN, KEY HISTORICAL AND
 LEGAL QUESTION HERE.
 ONE AREA WHERE BARR SAYS HE WILL
 WITHHOLD INFORMATION FROM THIS
 REPORT HAS TO DO WITH GRAND JURY
 TESTIMONY.
 WELL, A JUDGE CAN RELEASE THAT
 GRAND JURY TESTIMONY AND MAKE IT
 PUBLIC.
 THERE'S HISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR
 THAT, IN KEN STARR'S
 INVESTIGATION, ALSO THE
 WATERGATE INVESTIGATION.
 MY UNDERSTANDING IN WATERGATE,
 ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE THIS
 BECAME A REASON TO MAKE IT
 PUBLIC WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS AN
 OFFICIEACHMENT INQUIRY.
 DOES THAT INCENTIVIZE
 CONGRESS -NOW, THEY DON'T WANT
 TO DO THIS.
 DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO USE
 IMPEACHMENT REALLY IN ANY WAY
 RIGHT NOW.
 BUT MIGHT THEY NEED TO, TO MAKE
 THE LEGAL CASE THAT THEY HAVE A
 RIGHT TO SEE THE GRAND JURY
 TESTIMONY?
 JOHN, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF
 CASE LAW ON THIS.
 THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF CASES.
 THERE'S SOME CONFLICTING CASES.
 THE D.C. CIRCUIT HAS BEEN VERY
 FAVORABLE TO CONGRESS.
 BUT AS YOU POINT OUT, IT'S BEEN
 IN THE IMPEACHMENT CONTEXT.
 NOT JUST PRESIDENTS, BUT JUDGES.
 AND SO THEY WANT TO SEE -IT'S
 A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION WHEN
 IT'S JUST A GENERAL OVERSIGHT
 INQUIRY.
 THE CASE LAW IS VERY MIXED
 THERE.
 SO, THIS IS NO SURE ROUTE.■
 IF THEY DO ISSUE A SUBPOENA THAT
 THEY CAN GET THIS MATERIAL VIA
 SUBPOENA, THE GRAND JURY
 MATERIAL
 THEY CAN PROBABLY GET EVERYTHING
 SURROUNDING THE GRAND JURY AND
 LEARN LARGELY WHAT DID HAPPEN IN
 A GRAND JURY.
 THEY CAN GET NOTES FROM
 PROSECUTORS.
 THEY CAN GET OTHER THINGS THAT
 WEREN'T ACTUALLY PRESENTED IN A
 GRAND JURY, FBI SUMMARIES, BUT
 THE GRAND JURY ITSELF, THE 6-E
 RULE IS VERY TIGHT.
 SHAN, ONE OTHER FASCINATING
 THING IN THESE TWO PAGES THAT WE
 GOT FROM WILLIAM BARR, HE MADE A
 POINT OF SAYING THAT THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL, NOT THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S TEAM, THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL IS ASSISTING HIM IN
 GOING THROUGH THIS 400-PAGE
 REPORT.
 TO ME, THAT FEELS LIKE A
 MESSAGE, THAT MUELLER IS BUYING
 IN.
 MAY NOT BE TRUE, I DON'T KNOW.
 BUT IT'S A MESSAGE THAT BARR
 WANTS TO DELIVER THAT MUELLER IS
 BUYING INTO WHAT BARR IS DOING.
 IT DOES SOUND LIKE A MESSAGE.
 FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT,
 JOHN, YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE THE
 MUELLER TEAM'S ASSISTANCE IN
 SCRUBBING WHAT'S THE GRAND JURY
 MATERIAL AND ONGOING
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 SO, THAT'S REALLY SORT OF A
 PRACTICAL POINT THAT HE PUTS OUT
 THERE, BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS THE
 IMPLICIT ATMOSPHERIC THAT THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL IS BUYING INTO
 EVERYTHING THAT WE DO.
 MUELLER WAS NOT A PART OF THE
 FOUR-PAGE SUMMARY LAST WEEK, SO
 THAT HE'S A PART OF THIS NOW IS
 INTERESTING.
 SHAN, JOHN, MAGGIE, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 A LOT MORE AHEAD FOR US
 TONIGHT, INCLUDING A DISCUSSION
 WITH THE MAN WHO'S BEEING t
 FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF THEr#■#E.
 ISING TO BACK DOWN AFTER
 THE BARR SUMMARY AND AS
 DEMOCRATS HAVE QUIETED TALKS OF?
 AND LATER, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 IS WARNING THAT HE WILL CLOSE
 THE BORDER WITH MEXICO AS EARLY
 AS NEXT WEEK.
 WHAT IS BEHIND THIS NEW THREAT
 AND THE NEW DEADLINE?
 WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST AHEAD.@■■■

 AGAIN, OUR BREAKING NEWS, ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR SAYS HE
 WILL DELIVER THE MUELLER REPORT,
 OR MOST OF IT, TO CONGRESS BY
 MID-APRIL IF NOT SOONER.
 A REPORT THAT BARR SAYS IS
 NEARLY 400 PAGES LONG.
 WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT, HOUSE
 SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI SAYS THAT
 FOR NOW, IMPEACHMENT IS NOT ON
 THE TABLE.
 DEMOCRATS, SHE SAYS, SHOULD
 FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE AND THE
 ECONOMY.
 THAT IS NOT WHAT MY NEXT GUEST
 THINKS.
 HE'S TOM STEYER, FOUNDER OF NEED
 TO IMPEACH.
 TOM, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH
 US.
 ROBERT MUELLER SAYS THERE WAS NO
 CRIMINAL COORDINATION OR
 CONSPIRACY WITH RUSSIA.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS
 THERE WAS NO CRIMINAL
 OBSTRUCTION.
 NO DEMOCRATS WANT TO GO DOWN
 THIS ROAD, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE
 COMPLICATIONS IT POSES FOR THE
 PRESIDENT.
 WHY ARE YOU GOING TO THE MAT ON
 THIS?
 JOHN, WE'RE A GRASSROOTS
 ORGANIZATION.
 8 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED OUR
 PETITION ASKING THAT THE
 PRESIDENT BE IMPEACHED.
 WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO PUT
 THE EVIDENCE IN FRONT OF THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 WE'VE SAID FOR A YEAR, DON'T
 WAIT FOR THE MUELLER REPORT.
 BUT WHEN THE MUELLER REPORT
 COMES, LET'S LOOK AT THE
 INFORMATION.
 WE ALREADY KNOW FROM THE PUBLIC
 RECORD THAT THIS IS THE MOST
 CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN
 HISTORY.
 AND I BELIEVE WE'VE SEEN HIM
 OBSTRUCT JUSTICE.
 SO I BELIEVE WHAT WE REALLY WANT
 TO DO IS PUT THE EVIDENCE IN
 FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 THROUGH PUBLIC HEARINGS, THROUGH
 GIVING US HIS TAX RECORDS, AND
 BY GIVING US THE FULL MUELLER
 REPORT SO WE, THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CAN
 DECIDE FOR OURSELVES WHETHER HE
 DID -WHETHER WHAT HE DID WAS
 OBSTRUCT JUSTICE AND BREAK HIS
 VOW TO US AND TO THE
 CONSTITUTION.
 LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.
 WE'VE ONLY SEEN 101 WORDS THAT
 ARE DIRECT QUOTES FROM THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 BUT AMONG THEM ARE, HE SAYS HE
 COULD NOT OR WILL NOT ESTABLISH
 A CRIMINAL CASE FOR CONSPIRACY
 OR COORDINATION.
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE
 IN THESE 400 PAGES, ANYTHING
 THAT ROBERT MUELLER COULD SAY
 THAT WOULD CONVINCE YOU TO DROP
 YOUR PURSUIT OF IMPEACHMENT?
 JOHN, I HAVEN'T SEEN THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 I KNOW THAT.
 YOU CAN'T --
 BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO
 ESTABLISH WHETHER --
 I WILL SAY THIS.
 OKAY.
 I WILL SAY THIS.
 WE WILL LOOK AT THE INFORMATION
 THERE, WHICH HAS BEEN GATHERED
 OVER TWO YEARS AND TRY AND
 UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS.
 BUT WE HAVE IN THE PUBLIC RECORD
 THAT THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO'S
 REFUSED TO DIVEST HIMSELF FROM
 HIS BUSINESS, WHO'S CONTINUED TO
 DO BUSINESS WITH FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENTS AND WITH AMERICAN
 CORPORATIONS OVER WHOM HE HAS A
 LOT OF CONTROL --
 AND THAT'S MY QUESTION.
 ARE YOU FOR IMPEACHMENT NO
 MATTER WHAT THE MUELLER REPORT
 SAYS, ASIDE FROM ANYTHING THAT
 MIGHT BE IN THERE?
 THERE IS SOMETHING IN THERE
 THAT I WILL LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY
 AND I BELIEVE HONESTLY AND
 OBJECTIVELY, WHICH IS WHAT IS
 THE INFORMATION THAT HE'S
 GATHERED ON OBSTRUCTION.
 BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME AND I
 THINK THAT'S THE POINT, JOHN.
 THERE'S A QUESTION HERE ABOUT
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GETTING TO
 SEE THIS.
 NOT THE INSIDERS IN WASHINGTON,
 D.C., NOT THE ADMINISTRATION
 DECIDING WHETHER THE
 ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN CORRUPT
 AND LAWLESS.
 GIVE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AND LET ME
 SAY, THERE IS A REAL QUESTION
 HERE ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT
 IS GOING TO BE TREATED EQUALLY
 BEFORE THE LAW LIKE EVERY OTHER
 AMERICAN.
 WHAT ABOUT WHAT -WHAT ABOUT
 WHAT NANCY PELOSI SAYS, WHICH IS
 THAT SHE WOULD RATHER THE
 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS FOCUS ON
 OTHER THINGS?
 WELL, LET ME SAY THIS.
 CONGRESS HAS FULL CAPABILITY,
 AND I'VE ASKED THEM DIRECTLY,
 NOT ONLY TO GO FORWARD AND TRY
 TO PASS LEGISLATION ON HEALTH
 CARE AND THE ECONOMY, BUT THEY
 ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY AT THE
 SAME TIME TO HOLD PUBLIC
 HEARINGS AND LET THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE SEE WHAT HAS GONE ON
 HERE.
 I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CONFLICT
 AT ALL.
 BUT WHAT I DO THINK IS TRUE IS
 WE CANNOT NORMALIZE THE KIND OF
 CORRUPT BEHAVIOR THAT THIS
 PRESIDENT HAS SHOWN BEFORE AND
 DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION.
 FOR INSTANCE, WE KNOW FROM THE
 ONE DAY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT
 WE'VE SEEN, WHICH WAS THE
 TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL COHEN
 BEFORE THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT
 COMMITTEE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS
 INVOLVED IN FELONIES WHILE HE
 WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
 SO FROM MY STANDPOINT, WE NEED
 TO HAVE A SERIES OF HEARINGS, SO
 AMERICANS CAN LOOK AND SEE WHO
 THE PRESIDENT SURROUNDS HIMSELF
 WITH AND WHAT KINDS OF
 ACTIVITIES THEY WERE INVOLVED
 WITH TOGETHER AND LET US MAKE UP
 OUR MINDS.
 THIS IS A POLITICAL QUESTION,
 NOT A CRIMINAL QUESTION.
 THIS IS A POLITICAL QUESTION
 ABOUT WHETHER THIS PRESIDENT IS
 CORRUPT AND WHETHER HE'S PUT HIS
 INTERESTS AHEAD OF THE INTERESTS
 OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 TOM STEYER, THANK YOU FOR
 JOINING US TONIGHT.
 WE LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING TO
 YOU MORE.
 MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN
 ALL OF US HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN
 WHAT'S IN THIS REPORT.
 THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING,
 JOHN.
 WE HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WILL
 CLOSE THE ENTIREN BORDER
 OR LARGE PARTS OF IT BY NEXT A8C
 ISG ITS PART TO STOP
 ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
 COMING UP, CAN HE ACTUALLY DO
 THAT?■■■■ HAPPEN IF HE

          -Tell me about   that dental procedure again!
           -I can still       taste it in my mouth!
           <i> -Progressive</i>    <i> helps keep you out there.</i>
 MORE BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THREATENING
 TO CLOSE THE BORDER BETWEEN THE
 UNITED STATES AND MEXICO AS
 EARLY AS NEXT WEEK, SAYING
 THERE'S NO MORE DETENTION SPACE
 TO HOLD UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
 LAST NIGHT IN A BLISTERING
 SPEECH TO SUPPORTERS IN
 MICHIGAN, HE SAID A LARGE PART
 OF THE PROBLEM WERE FRAUDULENT
 ASYLUM SEEKERS WANTING TO ENTER
 THE UNITED STATES.
 YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING UP --
 YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL MET BY THE
 LAWYERS.
 THE LAWYERS HAVE -AND THEY
 COME OUT.
 THEY'RE ALL MET BY THE LAWYERS.
 AND THEY SAY, SAY THE FOLLOWING
 PHRASE.
 I AM VERY AFRAID FOR MY LIFE.
 I AM AFRAID FOR MY LIFE.
 OKAY.
 AND THEN I LOOK AT THE GUY.
 HE LOOKS LIKE HE JUST GOT OUT OF
 THE RING, HE'S THE HEAVYWEIGHT
 CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.
 IT'S A BIG FAT CON JOB, FOLKS.
 SO IF THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY
 GOES THROUGH WITH THE DRASTIC
 MOVE OF CLOSING THE BORDER, IT
 WOULD NOT ONLY STOP PEOPLE BUT
 ALSO BILLIONS IN TRADE.
 JOINING ME NOW, FORMER
 REPUBLICAN SENATOR RICK SANTORUM
 AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST MARIA
 CARDONA.
 SENATOR, LET ME START WITH YOU,
 CLOSING THE ENTIRE BORDER.
 AS A PRO BUSINESS REPUBLICAN,
 ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF CLOSING THE
 ENTIRE BORDER WITH MEXICO?
 I'M CERTAINLY NOT FROM A
 BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE.
 IT'S NOT A BENEFIT TO OUR
 COUNTRY, IT'S NOT A BENEFIT
 CERTAINLY TO THE PEOPLE IN THE
 SOUTHWEST.
 I MEAN, IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING
 TO THEM.
 BUT IT DOES SEND A MESSAGE AND
 IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO MEXICO.
 THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE MESSAGE
 NEEDS TO BE SENT.
 YOU'VE GOT LITERALLY NOW -EVEN
 THOSE ON THE LEFT ARE ADMITTING
 THAT WE'VE GOT A CRISIS DOWN
 THERE WITH THE HUGE NUMBERS OF
 PEOPLE NOW COMING.
 ALL COMING NOT FROM MEXICO BUT
 TRAVELING THROUGH MEXICO.
 SO THIS IS SOMETHING THE MEXICAN
 GOVERNMENT COULD DO SOMETHING
 ABOUT IF THEY WANTED TO BUT
 THEY'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING
 ABOUT IT AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK
 THE MESSAGE -YOU KNOW, THE
 MESSAGE OF DOING SOMETHING MORE
 DRAMATIC AT THE BORDER IS
 DIRECTED AT THEM.
 IS THAT HOW YOU SEE IT,
 MARIA?
 NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT, JOHN.
 I THINK WHAT THIS PRESIDENT BOTH
 SAID IN HIS THREATS ABOUT
 CLOSING THE BORDER AND IN HIS
 DISGUSTING MOCKERY OF ASYLUM
 SEEKERS TELLS US THAT HE HAS NO
 IDEA HOW TO FIX THE IMMIGRATION
 SYSTEM, AND WORSE, HE'S NOT EVEN
 INTERESTED IN FIXING IT.
 HE IS USING THIS AS A CLARION
 CALL FOR HIS BASE.
 THAT IS IT.
 YES, WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM, WE DO
 HAVE A CRISIS AT THE BORDER.
 GUESS HOW YOU FIX IT.
 YOU ACTUALLY FOCUS ON REAL
 SOLUTIONS.
 YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S GOING
 TO TAKE TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
 STAY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES.
 THAT'S GOING TO TAKE DIPLOMATIC
 RELATIONS.
 THAT'S GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE
 UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING ON
 IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND ACTUALLY
 HELPING TO FIX AND RESOLVE AND
 STABILIZE THEIR ECONOMY AND
 THEIR GOVERNMENT.
 HERE'S THE PROBLEM, JOHN.
 TO FIX THIS LONGSTANDING
 IMMIGRATION PROBLEM, IT'S GOING
 TO BE HARD.
 IT'S GOING TO TAKE BIPARTISAN
 SOLUTIONS BASED POLICY, AND IT'S
 GOING TO TAKE A REAL FOCUS ON
 DOING THIS IN A HUMANE WAY.
 DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T DO HARD.
 DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T DO
 SOLUTIONS-BASED POLICY.
 AND DONALD TRUMP CERTAINLY DOES
 NOT DO HUMANE.
 WHAT ABOUT THE LANGUAGE,
 SENATOR, THAT MARIA WAS TALKING
 ABOUT THERE.
 THE MOCKING LANGUAGE CALLING IT
 A CON JOB FROM THESE ASYLUM
 SEEKERS, WHO AS YOU KNOW ARE
 COMING FROM EL SALVADOR AND
 COUNTRIES RIDDLED BY VIOLENCE.
 YOU KNOW, AS A MAN OF DEEP
 FAITH, AS I KNOW YOU ARE, IS
 THAT THE RIGHT WAY TO TALK ABOUT
 THESE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THIS
 COUNTRY SAYING THEY'RE
 SUFFERING?
 WELL, WHAT HE'S DOING --
 LOOK, I DON'T LIKE THE
 PRESIDENT'S TONE WHEN HE DOES
 THOSE TYPES OF MOCKERIES.
 I THINK IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
 THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE DOING.
 HAVING SAID THAT, HE DOES POINT
 OUT THAT, LOOK, A GREAT
 NUMBER -A FAIRLY HIGH
 PERCENTAGE OF ASYLUM SEEKERS DO
 NOT SUCCEED IN THEIR ASYLUM AND
 DON'T HAVE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS.
 I THINK YOU CERTAINLY CAN MAKE
 THAT CASE BY THE NUMBERS.
 HE MAKES IT BY MOCKERY AND
 DRAMA, AND THAT WAY WE TALK
 ABOUT IT.
 IF YOU MADE IT BY THE NUMBERS,
 NO ONE WOULD TALK ABOUT IT.
 THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE
 PRESIDENT COMMUNICATES.
 YOU CAN LIKE IT OR NOT LIKE IT,
 BUT HE DOES GET HIS POINT
 ACROSS.
 WE HAVE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT.
 LOOK, TO ANSWER MARIA'S ISSUE
 THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T DO
 HARD, THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW OR
 THE OTHER THAT WE'RE GOING TO
 STEM THE TIDE OF PEOPLE COMING
 TO THIS COUNTRY BY DIPLOMATIC OR
 EMERGENCY OR ECONOMIC AID TO EL
 SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA, YOU WANT
 TO TALK ABOUT LONG TERM, THAT'S
 LONG TERM.
 THE SHORT-TERM PROBLEM WHICH IS
 REAL HAS TO BE DEALT WITH AND
 THAT IS RELATIVELY EASY IF THE
 MEXICANS DECIDE THEY WANT TO
 PARTICIPATE IN STEMMING THAT
 TIDE.
 RICK, BEFORE I LET MARIA
 ANSWER THAT, SENATOR, ARE YOU
 SAYING YOU WOULDN'T USE THE TYPE
 OF LANGUAGE THE PRESIDENT USES
 HERE.
 BUT MAKING FUN OF ASYLUM
 SEEKERS, MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE
 FLEEING VIOLENCE, ARE YOU REALLY
 SAYING THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE WAY
 OF MAKING AN ARGUMENT?
 I'M SAYING THE PRESIDENT'S
 EXAMPLE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
 WANT TO CALL IT MAKING FUN.
 HE CALLED IT A CON JOB AND
 SAID --
 HE WAS MAKING FUN.
 WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT
 THERE ARE PROBABLY CIRCUMSTANCES
 THAT FIT THE BILL.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S AN
 APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT, BUT AS
 I SAID, IT'S EFFECTIVE IN THE
 SENSE THAT IT GETS PEOPLE TO
 TALK ABOUT THE POINT OF THE
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COME OVER
 HERE WHO SIMPLY DO NOT QUALIFY
 FOR ASYLUM AND NEVER WOULD AND
 SHOULDN'T BE.
 GO AHEAD, MARIA.
 BUT, SENATOR, HOW IS THAT
 HELPING TO FIX THE PROBLEM BY
 MOCKING THESE PEOPLE?
 WHY DOESN'T HE SIT DOWN WITH
 PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY EXPERTS
 AT HOW YOU FIX ASYLUM?
 AND THE ISSUE IS ACTUALLY NOT
 PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GAME
 THE SYSTEM.
 THE ISSUE ISN'T EVEN ACTUALLY
 MONEY, BECAUSE IMMIGRATION --
 HOMELAND SECURITY GOT A TON MORE
 MONEY IN THE CR THAT WE JUST
 PASSED, THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE
 MISSING IS ACTUALLY PEOPLE THAT
 ARE WANTING TO AND WILLING TO
 SIT DOWN AND FOCUS ON A
 SOLUTION.
 I CAN TALK ABOUT TWO QUICK
 SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW, SENATOR,
 THAT WOULD HELP TO STEM THE
 TIDE.
 SPEND SOME MONEY ON ADDITIONAL
 IMMIGRATION JUDGES TO SET UP
 ASYLUM INTERVIEWS ON THE BORDER
 AND THEN YOU TRY TO DO THESE
 CASES AND DO THEM QUICKLY.
 THAT'S ONE VERY QUICK THING.
 BUT AGAIN, THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT
 INTERESTED IN SOLUTIONS.
 HE'S INTERESTED IN USING THESE
 PEOPLE TO HELP HIS OWN POLITICAL
 SITUATION.
 WE ARE INTERESTED IN
 SOLUTIONS HERE AND WE WILL TALK
 ABOUT THEM AGAIN VERY SOON.
 SENATOR SANTORUM, MARIA CARDONA,
 THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.
 I APPRECIATE IT.
 THANK YOU.

 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BACK IN ATTACK MODE AND HE'S TAKING AIM
 AT ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TARGETS.
 LAST NIGHT BEFORE A FRIENDLY
 CROWD IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN,
 THE PRESIDENT SPENT A GOOD CHUNK
 OF HIS 85-MINUTE SPEECH GOING
 AFTER DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA,
 WHO HE CLAIMS KNEW ALL ALONG
 THAT HE NEVER COLLUDED WITH
 RUSSIA.
 THE CORRUPT MEDIA, AND IT'S
 NEVER BEEN MORE CORRUPT THAN IT
 IS TODAY.
 THE MEDIA BOSSES, BAD PEOPLE.
 THE CROOKED JOURNALISTS, THE
 TOTALLY DISHONEST TV PUNDITS.
 BY THE WAY, THEY KNOW IT'S NOT
 TRUE.
 THEY JUST GOT GREAT RATINGS.
 SO, SLAMMING THE MEDIA IN
 FRONT OF CROWDS OF SUPPORTERS IS
 NOT NEW FOR THIS PRESIDENT.
 WHAT IS NEW, THE RNC AND
 PRO-TRUMP SUPER PAC, AMERICA
 FIRST, ARE REPORTEDLY PLANNING
 ON TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER.
 A SOURCE TELLS "THE ATLANTIC"
 THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE PREPARED
 TO HIT REPORTERS WITH 30-SECOND
 SPOTS HIGHLIGHTING THEIR, QUOTE,
 RIDICULOUS CLAIMS ABOUT
 COLLUSION.
 THE SOURCE ALSO CLAIMS THE
 REPORTERS' TWEETS HAVE BEEN
 SCREENCAPPED AND IT'S ALL READY
 TO GO.
 AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST SAM
 DONALDSON JOINS US NOW.
 SAM, YOU KNOW ATTACKS ON
 COVERAGE IS NOT NEW BUT A PAID
 POLITICAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST
 SPECIFIC REPORTERS, THAT SEEMS
 UNUSUAL.
 YEAH, THAT WAS A NEW ANGLE
 LAST NIGHT IN GRAND RAPIDS.
 YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A
 LOLLAPALOOZA OF A SPEECH.
 THE PRESIDENT WENT ALMOST TWO
 HOURS.
 I THINK FIDEL CASTRO ONCE WENT
 FIVE HOURS.
 NOW, WHEN I TELL HIM THAT CASTRO
 WENT FIVE HOURS, HE'LL GO, I CAN
 DO THAT AND MIGHT DO IT.
 TO ATTACK THE PRESS, I DO NOT
 KNOW, JOHN, WHO THE DEMOCRATIC
 NOMINEE IS GOING TO BE NEXT
 YEAR.
 IT WON'T BE ME, IT WON'T BE A
 REPORTER.
 TO RUN AGAINST US HE'S GOT TO
 RUN AGAINST A REAL, LIVE PERSON
 WHO WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT.
 AND THE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE
 IMPORTANT.
 HE GIVES US, HE GIVES THEM
 HEALTH CARE.
 HE SAYS LET'S RUN ON HEALTH
 CARE.
 PLEASE, PLEASE, COME AHEAD.
 LET'S DO THAT.
 LET'S RUN ON CRUELTY TO CHILDREN
 HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
 LOOK AT HIS BUDGET.
 LET'S TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM THE
 SPECIAL OLYMPICS.
 WELL, MS. DeVOS HAD TO BACKTRACK
 ON THAT WHEN THE PRESSURE GOT
 TOO HARD.
 LET'S LOOK AT HIS RECORD.
 HE'S RUNNING, NOT THE PRESS.
 AND THE FACTS WILL BE OUT.
 DO YOU FEEL, THOUGH, THAT THE
 REPEATED ATTACKS, THAT IT COULD
 BE POLITICALLY EFFECTIVE?
 IT WILL BE POLITICALLY
 EFFECTIVE WITH HIS BASE.
 HE'S GOT 31%, 32%, HARDCORE.
 HE CAN DO ANYTHING, AS HE SAYS,
 SHOOT SOMEBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF
 THE DAY, WOULDN'T LOSE A SINGLE
 ONE OF THEIR VOTES.
 BUT THEY'RE NOT THE MAJORITY IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE THE
 MAJORITY, I DON'T BELIEVE.
 I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM IN

 AN INTERVIEW ABOUT HIS BUSINESS.
 HIS BUSINESS WAS FAILING BUT HE
 BLEW A LOT OF SMOKE.
 DURING THE COURSE OF THE
 INTERVIEW HE CALLED ME RUDE, HE
 CALLED ME IGNORANT.
 I'M NOT THAT SMART.
 HE CALLED ME OUT TO GET HIM.
 SO I'M ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF
 THE DONALD J. TRUMP ATTACK
 MACHINE.
 IT DIDN'T HURT ME.
 I JUST WENT ON.
 BY THE WAY, I WAS NOT OUT TO GET
 HIM AT THAT TIME.
 AND I'M NOT OUT TO GET HIM NOW.
 HE WANTS TO RUN ON ALL OF THIS
 JUNK.
 I THINK HIS OPPONENT OUGHT TO
 RUN ON THE ISSUES THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE REALLY APPARENTLY CARE
 ABOUT.
 LAST NOVEMBER, THEY WEIGHED IN,
 MR. PRESIDENT.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
 DID YOU WIN THAT?
 YES, ON ELECTION NIGHT YOU SAID
 IT WAS ALMOST A TOTAL VICTORY.
 ONCE AGAIN, DOES HE REALLY KNOW
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 LET ME ASK YOU THIS, SAM.
 YOU COVERED MANY ADMINISTRATIONS
 AND MANY PRESIDENTS.
 LAST NIGHT SPEAKING BEFORE THIS
 CROWD, THE PRESIDENT SAID, AND I
 QUOTE, RIDICULOUS --.
 HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT
 CONGRESS WAS SAYING ABOUT HIM
 AND HE USED THOSE WORDS.
 ARE THOSE WORDS IN YOUR MIND
 THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES SHOULD BE USING?
 HE'S USED THEM BEFORE.
 AND WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THAT
 OVER TIME?
 I THINK THE IMPACT IS TO TURN
 A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF.
 MAYBE NOT HIS BASE.
 THEY MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIM.
 WELL, HE WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
 A POINT.
 IT WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK, WE ALL
 DO THAT.
 NO, WE DON'T ALL DO THAT.
 AND IF WE DO IT, WE DO IT
 PRIVATELY AND JUST WITH OUR
 GENTLEMAN FRIENDS.
 HAVE I USED THAT WORD YOU JUST
 USED?
 SURE, I HAVE.
 NOT ON TELEVISION, NOT IN
 PUBLIC, NOT TO PEOPLE IF I DO A
 TALK ONCE IN A WHILE.
 THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT
 CONFORM TO ANY RULES AND NORMS
 OF CIVILITY, ANY RULES AND NORMS
 OF BEHAVIOR THAT I THINK MOST
 AMERICANS WANT TO SEE, WHETHER
 THEY WANT TO SEE IT IN THEIR
 HOUSE OF WORSHIP, WHETHER THEY
 WANT TO SEE IT IN THEIR SCHOOLS,
 WHETHER THEY WANT TO SEE IT IN
 THEIR CLUBS, WHETHER THEY WANT
 TO SEE IT IN THEIR SOCIAL LIFE.
 HE DOESN'T CARE.
 I THINK AMERICANS CARE.
 I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT OUT.
 BUT I COULD BE WRONG.
 SAM DONALDSON, ONE OF MY
 FAVORITE, MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE
 FORMER ABC NEWS REPORTERS, THANK
 YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.
 JOHN, I'VE SAID IT BEFORE,
 YOU'RE TOO EASILY PLEASED.
 I APPRECIATE IT, SAM.
 AS I SAID, YOU'RE MY FAVORITE.
 NOW, TO ONE OF MY TOP 10 OR
 15 FAVORITE FORMER ABC NEWS
 REPORTERS, CHRIS CUOMO.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S
 COMING UP AT THE TOP OF THE
 HOUR.
 EASY, HE WAS MY MENTOR.
 I DID A SHOW WITH SAM.
 HE WAS MY FAVORITE.
 HE TAUGHT ME A LOT OF MY
 TACTICS.
 HE WAS MY FAVORITE.
 YOU'RE ONE OF MY TOP TEN.
 YOU'RE UP THERE.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S
 OKAY.
 LET ME TELL YOU, THIS IS THE
 FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SAID THIS.
 I THINK SAM IS WRONG.
 ONE, HE IS MAYBE ONE OF THE
 FIRST VICTIMS OF THE TRUMP PR
 MACHINE.
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 HE WROTE A LETTER WHEN CHRIS AND
 I WERE INVESTIGATING HIS NET
 WORTH WHERE HE DAMNED ME BACK TO
 THE WOMB.
 HE WAS GOING TO SUE ME, ALL OF
 ABC, ALL OF DISNEY, AND MY
 PARENTS.
 DAMNING ME BACK TO THE WOMB,
 LITERALLY.
 EVEN THOUGH IT WAS WRITTEN BY
 HIS LAWYER, WE THEORIZED THAT HE
 NOT ONLY WROTE IT OR HAD A HAND
 IN IT BUT DICTATED IT BECAUSE IT
 SOUNDED JUST LIKE HIM.
 AND FOR THE COARSE LANGUAGE, HE
 DOES IT BECAUSE IT WORKS FOR
 HIM.
 SAM IS THERE ON THE SCREEN.
 I LOVE YOU, YOU LOOK AS GOOD AS
 EVER AND YOUR POINTS ARE AS
 SALIENT AS EVER.
 BUT I BELIEVE HIS COARSENESS IS
 A DEVICE.
 SAM, CUOMO SAYS YOU'RE WRONG.
 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HIM?
 I GOT ATTACKED PERSONALLY ON
 CAMERA BY HIM.
 YOU GOT A LETTER?
 COME ON, CHRIS.
 YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.
 I'M THE WINNER, I'M THE BIG ONE.
 OH, GOSH, IT'S INFECTIOUS, ISN'T
 IT?
 HE TOLD ME THE REASON HE GETS
 AUDITED SO MUCH BY THE IRS IS
 BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A DEVOUT
 CHRISTIAN.
 TRUMP?
 YEAH, HE TOLD ME THAT DURING
 A DEBATE.
 MY POINT IS THIS.
 HE SAYS OUTLANDISH THINGS AND IT
 MAKES PEOPLE THINK, SEE, HE'S
 ONE OF US.
 HE'S NOT ONE OF THEM, HE'S NOT A
 POLITICIAN, HE'S NOT AN ELITE.
 HE TALKS LIKE US, HE MAKES
 POINTS LIKE WE DO, HE'S ABOUT
 US.
 I THINK IT WORKS TO HIS
 ADVANTAGE.
 WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT, BUT
 THAT'S MY SENSE.
 SAM DONALDSON, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH.
 CHRIS AND I COLLECTIVELY, YOU
 ARE OUR FAVORITE.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 CHRIS, WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR
 SHOW IN ABOUT 11 MINUTES.
 YESTERDAY'S STUNNING
 REVERSAL ON SPECIAL OLYMPIC

 EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY DeVOS SPENT THIS WEEK GETTING
 GRILLED BY CONGRESSIONAL
 DEMOCRATS IN HEARINGS OVER THE
 PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE FEDERAL
 FUNDING FOR THE SPECIAL
 OLYMPICS.
 IT WAS A TOUGH SELL TO
 LAWMAKERS.
 THEN SHE HAD TO FACE THE PRESS,
 WHICH LED TO AWKWARD MOMENTS
 LIKE THIS ONE YOU'RE SEEING
 RIGHT HERE.
 BUT DeVOS STOOD BY HER PROPOSAL
 TO CUT NEARLY $18 MILLION IN
 FUNDING TO THE PROGRAM.
 THEN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, A
 TOTAL REVERSAL.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP APPARENTLY
 UNBEKNOWNST TO BETSY DeVOS
 ANNOUNCED THAT THE MONEY WON'T
 BE CUT AFTER ALL.
 I'VE BEEN TO THE SPECIAL
 OLYMPICS, I THINK IT'S
 INCREDIBLE.
 I JUST AUTHORIZED A FUNDING.
 I HEARD ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.
 I HAVE OVERRIDDEN MY PEOPLE.
 WE'RE FUNDING THE SPECIAL
 OLYMPICS.
 SO AS RANDI KAYE REPORTS,
 THIS IS NOT THE FIRST OR THE
 SECOND TIME THAT THE PRESIDENT
 HAS THROWN ONE OF HIS CABINET
 MEMBERS UNDER THE BUS.
 THE PRESIDENT CAN'T UNDERCUT
 HIS OWN CABINET.
 THE PRES THE LEADER OF
 THE CABINET. orter: DESPITE WHA
 PRESS SECRETARY SAYS, PRESIDENT
 DONALD TRUMP DOES EXACTLY THAT,
 UNDERCUTS NOT JUST HIS CABINET
 BUT MANY ON HIS WHITE HOUSE
 STAFF, AGAIN AND AGAIN.
 DURING THE TRAVEL BAN --
 FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT A
 TRAVEL BAN.
 WHEN WE USE WORDS LIKE TRAVEL
 BAN THAT, MISREPRESENTS WHAT IT
 IS.
 Reporter: JUST A FEW DAYS
 LATER, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
 STILL CALLING IT A BAN, TWEETING
 WHAT IS OUR COUNTRY COMING TO
 WHEN A JUDGE CAN HALT A HOMELAND
 SECURITY TRAVEL BAN?T AGAIN AFT
 THEN FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.
 THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF HAS ONE
 NARRATIVE.
 HE ACTED DECISIVELY TODAY.
 HE TOOK THE RECOMMENDATION OF T■
 Reporter: A DEPUTY ATTORNEY■á
 GE■o2 LIKE COMEY'S LING OF THE
 E-MAIL INVESTIGATION.
 BUT IN THIS BOMBSHELL INTERVIEW
 WITH NBC, THE PRESIDENT SAYS
 COMEY WAS FIRED BECAUSE OF THE
 RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
 IN FACT WHEN I DECIDED TO
 JUST DO IT, I SAID TO MYSELF, I
 SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIA
 THING WITH TRUMP AND RUSSIA IS A
 MADE-UP STORY.
 Reporter: RUSSIA WAS THE
 REASON TRUMP UNDERCUT HIS
 DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
 INTELLIGENCE TOO, CASTING DOUBT
 ON DAN COATS' WARNING ABOUT
 RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE.
 AFTER TRUMP MET WITH PUTIN IN
 HELSINKI, HE WAS ASKED WHOM HE
 BELIEVED REGARDING RUSSIAN
 MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION.
 TRUMP SAID THIS.
 MY PEOPLE CAME TO ME, DAN
 COATS CAME TO ME AND SOME
 OTHERS.
 THEY SAID THEY THINK IT'S
 RUSSIA.
 I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN.
 HE JUST SAID IT'S NOT RUSSIA.
 I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN MY
 INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE, BUT I WILL
 TELL YOU THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN
 WAS EXTREMELY STRONG AND
 POWERFUL IN HIS DENIAL TODAY.
 Reporter: AND WHAT ABOUT
 REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD
 REVEALED HIGHLY CLASSIFIED
 INFORMATION TO RUSSIAN OFFICIALS
 IN THE OVAL OFFICE?
 TEAM TRUMP REFUTED THAT.
 HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AT
 THE TIME QUICK TO CALL THE
 REPORT FALSE.
 AT NO TIME WERE INTELLIGENCE
 SOURCES OR METHODS DISCUSSED.
 I WAS IN THE ROOM, IT DIDN'T
 HAPPEN.
 Reporter: CUE THE PRESIDENT
 THE NEXT MORNING, SEEMING TO
 CONTRADICT HIS NATIONAL SECURITY
 ADVISOR.
 TWEETING, AS PRESIDENT, I WANTED
 TO SHARE WITH RUSSIA AT AN
 OPENLY SCHEDULED WHITE HOUSE
 MEETING WHICH I HAVE THE
 ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DO.
 FACTS PERTAINING TO TERRORISM
 AND AIRLINE FLIGHT SAFETY.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP UNDERCUT HIS
 FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, REX
 TILLERSON, TOO.
 WHILE TILLERSON WAS ON A
 DIPLOMATIC TRIP TO BEIJING,
 HOPING TO MAKE A DEAL ON NORTH
 KOREA.
 TRUMP TWEETING HE'S WASTING HIS
 TIME TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH
 LITTLE ROCKET MAN.
 MORE RECENTLY ON THE LOOMING
 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, VICE
 PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WAS THE T■0
 AFTER HIS OFFICE CHARACTERIZED
 THE MEETINGS HE HAD WITH AIDES
 TO TOP DEMOCRATS AS PRODUCTIVE,
 TRUMP THREW WATER ON THAT
 TWEETING VP MIKE PENCE JUST LEFT
 THE WHITE HOUSE.
 NOT MUCH HEADWAY MADE TODAY.
 RANDI KAYE, CNN, NEW YORK.
 DAVID GERGEN HAS ADVISED
 FOUR PRESIDENTS.
 HE'S ALSO A CNN SENIOR POLITICAL
 ANALYST.
 DAVID, WHEN YOU SEE THIS, THIS
 PUBLIC REALLY FLOGGING AND
 UNDERCUTTING OF CABINET MEMBERS
 AND WHITE HOUSE STAFF, WHAT DOES
 IT TELL YOU?
 IT TELLS ME THAT THIS
 PRESIDENT, HIS NARCISSISM KNOWS
 NO BOUNDS.
 LISTEN, LEADERSHIP 101 TEACHES
 YOU THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO LEAD
 A GROUP OF PEOPLE, THAT YOU WANT
 THEM TO BE LOYAL TO YOU.
 BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT
 LOYALTY RUNS BOTH WAYS.
 IN THIS CASE THE PRESIDENT
 CONTINUALLY DISMISSES OTHERS
 BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE THE
 CENTER OF ATTENTION.
 BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE GOING
 ON HERE I MIGHT SUGGEST, JOHN.
 THAT IS I THINK COMING OUT OF
 THE MUELLER REPORT AND WHAT HE
 SEES AS COMPLETE EXONERATION,
 HE'S GOT A NEW SWAGGER ABOUT HIM
 THESE LAST FEW DAYS.
 SO WHAT HAS HE DONE?
 HE'S OVERRIDDEN BETSY DeVOS, ONE
 OF THE MOST LOYAL MEMBERS OF HIS
 CABINET.
 HE'S THROWN A MONKEY WRENCH INTO
 THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE IN SUCH A
 WAY THAT HIS OWN REPUBLICANS ARE
 RUNNING SCARED FROM IT.
 TAKE MITCH McCONNELL, FOR
 EXAMPLE.
 HE'S ALSO NOW DECLARED THAT
 HE'LL CLOSE THE BORDER WITH
 MEXICO.
 THOSE ARE ALL ACTS OF SOMEONE
 WHO REALLY HAS A SENSE OF I'M IN
 CHARGE HERE, I'M COMPLETELY IN
 CHARGE.
 I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I WANT, I
 DON'T GIVE A DARN WHAT OTHER
 PEOPLE THINK.
 AND THERE'S A CERTAIN ARROGANCE
 ABOUT THIS THAT I THINK IS GOING
 TO IN THE LONG RUN COST HIM A
 LOT.
 THIS IS A HUBRIS WE'VE SEEN
 THIS WEEK.
 I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE THAT WE SEE
 DIFFERENT ACTIONS FROM THE
 PRESIDENT IN THE WAKE OF THAT
 HUBRIS BECAUSE THE SPLITS AND
 THE UNDERCUTTING OF THE CABINET
 MEMBERS IS SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN
 BEFORE.
 THERE ARE THOSE THAT WONDER,
 DAVID, IF WHETHER OR NOT HE
 TREATS IT AS SORT OF A PUBLIC
 FLOAT.
 HE DOESN'T CARE SPLITTING WITH
 HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION IF HE
 DOESN'T SEE THE APPROVAL FOR
 SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT HE
 WANTS TO OUT THERE.
 NO, AND I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
 I THINK HE VALUES SENDING A
 MESSAGE TO HIS BASE THAT HE'S
 HIS OWN INDEPENDENT GUY.
 HE'S NOT ONLY NOT BEHOLDEN TO
 DEMOCRATS, BUT HE'S NOT BEHOLDEN
 TO ANYBODY ELSE IN HIS OWN
 PARTY, IN HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE.
 AND THAT'S THE REASON HE'S GOT
 THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF TURNOVER.
 I THINK IF YOU TAKE ALL FOUR
 PRESIDENTS I WORKED FOR
 COMBINED, I DON'T THINK THERE
 WAS AS MUCH TURNOVER AS THERE
 HAS BEEN IN THIS WHITE HOUSE IN
 THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
 THE THING IS, THOUGH, THERE'S
 SOMETHING DISINGENUOUS ABOUT IT.
 THIS WAS A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
 BUDGET THAT BETSY DeVOS WAS
 DEFENDING ON CAPITOL HILL.
 YES, I'M SO GLAD YOU RAISE
 THAT POINT, THANK YOU.
 YES.
 WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT BUDGET
 WENT THROUGH THE OFFICE OF
 MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET WHERE
 MULVANEY STILL HAS A HUGE AMOUNT
 OF POWER.
 THEN IT WENT THROUGH THE WEST
 WING AND HAD TO BE APPROVED BITE
 PRESIDENT.
 THEY HAD TO RED FLAG ANYTHING IN
 THERE THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL TO
 GET IT BY THE PRESIDENT.
 THEN IT WAS PUBLISHED AND THEN,
 AHA, I ONLY LEARNED ABOUT IT
 FIVE MINUTES AGO AND I'M
 COMPLETELY OVERRIDING MY
 SECRETARY BE DAMNED.
 YEAH, IT REALLY JUST DOESN'T
 PASS THE SMELL TEST THAT IT
 DIDN'T HAVE HIS STAMP OF
 APPROVAL GOING IN.
 CERTAINLY SOMEONE WITHIN THE
 WHITE HOUSE KNEW ABOUT IT THE
 WHOLE TIME.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 DAVID GERGEN, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.
 THANK YOU FOR HELPING US
 UNDERSTAND, WHICH MAY NOT BE
 UNDERSTANDABLE SOMETIMES.
 REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
