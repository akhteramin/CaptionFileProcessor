 MARKET DAN SUZUKI.
 HEALTH CARE, PROFITS ARE
 SLOWING AND A GOOD TIME TO OWN
 IT'S CHEAP AND THE BEST
 LONG-TERM PERFORMING SECTORS OUT
 THERE.
 KAREN FINERMAN.
 WHAT HE SAID AND WITH MORE
 SPECIFICITY.
 ANTHEM CALLS
 UNICORN GUY
 I HAVE TO THANK -THE CRACK
 STAFF, KELLY CAME TO THE HOUSE
 AND SHE BROUGHT DOUGHNUTS AND
 BAGELS AND THE WHOLE THING
 A LOT OF FUN
 WYNN RESORTS
 YES, ONE MORE THING
 KATE AND WILLIAM
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY
 MY TWINS ARE NOW BIG TWINS
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
 THAT DOES IT FOR US AND SEE
 YOMY MISSION IS SIMPLE
 TO MAKE YOU MONEY.
 I'M HERE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING
 FIELD FOR ALL INVESTORS.
 THERE IS ALWAYS A BULL MARKET
 SOMEWHERE.
 AND I PROMISE TO HELP YOU FIND
 IT
 "MAD MONEY" STARTS NOW
 HEY, I'M CRAMER.
 WELCOME INTO "MAD MONEY.
 WELCOME TO CRAMERICA
 I DON'T WANT TO MAKE FRIENDS
 JUST MAKE YOU MONEY.
 MY JOB IS TO EDUCATE AND TEACH
 YOU AND PUT INTO CONTEXT SO CALL
 ME AT 800-743-CNBC OR TWEET ME
 AT JIM CRAMER.
 IF YOU WANT TO GET AN HONEST
 READ ON THE ECONOMY, FORGET THE
 GOVERNMENT DATA FROM THE
 COMMERCE DEPARTMENT OR THE
 FEDERAL RESERVE.
 INSTEAD YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE
 TRANSPORTS
 ESPECIALLY THE RAILS
 ALL ABOARD --
 ON A BLAH DAY WHERE THE DOW
 DIPPED 3 POINTS AND S&P AND
 NASDAQ UP -YOU HAVE AN
 INCREDIBLE SNAPSHOT OF THE
 ECONOMY FROM CSX AND STOCK THAT
 CAUGHT FIRE TODAY.
 YOU RECOGNIZE THE ECONOMY IS
 SLOW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, I
 LOOKED AT THIS STUFF
 THAT IS RIGHT.
 JUST WHEN FED CHIEF SAID IT WAS
 FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS SO HE
 NEEDED TO SLAM THE BRAKES BY
 RAISING INTEREST RATES, I DID
 THE HOMEWORK AND CHECK IN WITH
 THE CHEMICALS AND PAPERS AND
 HOLD BUILDERS AND THE TRANSPORTS
 ESPECIALLY THE RAILS
 SEE, THE RAILS WERE TELLING ME A
 DIFFERENT STORY FROM THE ROSIE
 ECONOMIC FORECAST.
 I HAD TO PUT IT INTO A MOSAIC BY
 HAND AND IT SHOWED THE ECONOMY
 IS SLOWING BECAUSE THE FED HAS
 GOTTEN TOO AGGRESSIVE AND NOT
 ACCELERATING BECAUSE THE FED
 HADN'T DONE ENOUGH
 I'M GLAD POWELL CHANGED HIS MIND
 BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE PEOPLE ON
 THE FEDERAL RESERVE DIDN'T WANT
 TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY ON THE
 CALLS FROM THE COMPANIES
 AND SOME BRANCHS IN ST. LOUIS,
 HIGH QUALITY SEARCH BUT TODAY WE
 HAVE THE BASE BOOK WITH GOOD
 NUGGETS.
 BUT IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT
 YOU COULD ASSEMBLE FOR YOURSELF
 BY KNOWING WHICH COMPANIES HAVE
 THEIR FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF
 THE ECONOMY AND THEY ARE BACKED
 UP BY COLD, HARD CASH AND
 RECEIPTS AND MANIFEST.
 WHAT IS IT TELLING ME NOW, I
 THINK WE HAVE A GOLDILOCKS
 ECONOMY.
 NOT TOO HOT OR TOO COLD.
 MAYBE THAT BORES YOU
 I DON'T CARE
 THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M ABOUT
 THIS ECONOMY NEEDS TO BREATHE
 WITHOUT THE FED HITTING US WITH
 ANOTHER CHOKEHOLD OF A RATE HIKE
 LIKE THE LAST ONE.
 MOST IMPORTANT MOSAIC IS THE
 TRANSPORTS
 THIS GROUP WAS INCREDIBLY
 NEGATIVE
 THEY WERE CHILLING
 I'M TALKING ABOUT FEDEX, THE
 LARGEST AND JB HUNT, THE SECOND
 LARGEST TRUCKING COMPANY AND
 FRED SMITH THE CEO OF FEDEX
 EXPLAINS THE WORLD IS DOWN
 TICKING.
 IMPACTING ALL BUSINESS AND IT
 WAS A DOWN BEAT CONVERSATION
 AFTER A SUBDUED CONFERENCE CALL.
 AND THEN IT WAS SOMETHING TO
 HEAR THIS MAJOR TRUCKING COMPANY
 SAY THERE IS NO PICKUP IN THE
 ECONOMY AT ALL
 ALL OF THE VOLUME NUMBERS WERE
 DOWN 6% TO 7% INCLUDING MARCH SO
 WE'RE GOING INTO APRIL COLD.
 HOWEVER, YOU COULD NEVER REALLY
 RELY ON JUST ONE OR TWO
 COMPANIES.
 THAT IS TWO ANECDOTAL.
 AFTER SAUL THEY HAVE -CHINA IS
 EXPERIENCING A SLOW DOWN UNTIL
 ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS AGO BUT THEY
 THEY PLACED A BET ON EUROPE.
 NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNITED
 STATES
 THEY ARE NOT ONE IN THE SAME
 THAT IS WHY I WAS SO FOCUSED ON
 CSX.
 THE RAILROAD SUPPORT
 AND I WAS AMAZED AT HOW STRONG
 IT WAS AND THAT IS WHY IT HIT A
 ALL HEIM HIGH UP 7%.
 AND THE BUSINESS DOESN'T STRETCH
 OVERSEAS
 NO TRAINS GO THERE BUT IT IS A
 TESA
 TERRIFIC TELL FOR THE ECONOMY
 AND ON THE HUNT FOR NEW STOCK
 PICKS.
 HOW DO YOU DO IT
 YOU TURN TO A PAGE THAT ALL
 RAILS HAVE IN THE SLIDESHOW
 DECK
 THIS IS THE REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS
 THE FIRST PAGE OF A RAIL IF YOU
 WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY
 OKAY
 THIS TELLS US ABOUT THE ECONOMY.
 ANYWAY, IT IS LABELLED STRONG
 PRICE AND FAVORABLE MIX DROVE
 REVENUE GAINS.
 SO THAT IS WHAT IT WOULD SAY
 ABOVE THAT
 FIRST ONE, CHEMICALS
 PLUS FIVE.
 COMMENTARY AND THEY INCREASED
 BROAD BASED GROWTH OFFSET BY LPG
 AND SHIPMENT DECLINES.
 WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE
 WHO COULD MATCH THAT
 AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE
 DECLINE, THAT IS A -RELATED TO
 FRACKING SAND NOT NEEDED FROM
 ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
 BUT THE ONE THAT WORKS FOR THIS
 IS THE NEW DOW CHEMICAL.
 AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT SUPPORTS
 A MAGNIFICENT 4.79% YIELD AND
 DOW HAS A ROBUST BOOK OF
 BUSINESS AS WE KNOW FROM THE
 INTERVIEW WITH THE CEO FROM
 "SQUAWK ON THE STREET.
 THEY HAVE A PLENTY OF PLANTS IN
 THE CSX TERRITORY AND SO YOU
 PLAY THIS CHEMICALS WITH DOW
 AND THEN NEXT AUTOMOTIVE
 IT IS DRIVEN BY STRENGTH IN
 TRUCKS AND SUVs.
 AND GM AND FORD COME TO MINDFUL
 I WOULD GO RATHER GO WITH FORD
 AND THEY SELL FOR JUST EIGHT
 TIMES EARNINGS AND STOM IS MORE
 THAN 6% AND THEY CUT COSTS
 THIS IS GUTSY AND I'M MAKING IT
 HERE, BUY FORD MOTOR AT $9.50.
 THEN THERE IS AG AND FOOD UP

 CSX SAID THERE WAS DRIVEN BY
 STRENGTH IN ETHANOL.
 FORGET THAT.
 I'LL GO BACK TO THE WELL
 DuPONT IS THE WAY TO PLAY IT
 WITH THE MASSIVE PROTECTION
 BUSINESS AND GENETICALLY
 MODIFIED BUSINESS AND DuPONT HAD
 CORN SEEDS AND THAT IS ETHANOL
 AND IT ANNOUNCED A WEAK COURT SO
 IT IS DERISK SO FOR THAT ONE,
 DuPONT
 AND HOW ABOUT FOREST, CSX SAID
 IT WAS LED BY GROWTH AND
 BUILDING AND STRONG IMPORT
 DEMAND
 TOUGH ONE.
 OPEN THE FILE ON WAREHOUSER AND
 LOSING MONEY ON A 5% YIELD AND I
 WOULD RATHER BUY A BIG HOME
 BUILDER.
 LET'S BUY LENNAR IN FLORIDA.
 AND THEN CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING
 PRODUCTS
 CATERPILLAR COULD BE A WINNER.
 I LIKE THAT STOCK.
 BUT IT IS TOO GLOBAL
 AND ROCK STONE COULD WORK BUT
 BANK OF AMERICA DOWNGRADED IT
 THE OTHER DAY AND WORRISOME.
 JIM FISH OF WASTE MANAGEMENT
 COMES ON THE SHOW AND OFTEN
 COMMENTED THE BEST SOURCE OF
 REVENUE IS CONSTRUCTION.
 THEY ANNOUNCED THE ACQUISITION
 OF THE COMPETITOR AND BUSINESS
 IS GOOD AND GETTING BETTER THAT
 IS THE ONE TO BUY.
 AND I'M TALKING ABOUT METAL AND
 EQUIPMENT AND FERTILIZER AND THE
 METAL IS DOING WELL BECAUSE
 THERE IS STEEL BUT TOO MUCH
 COMPETITION AND COAL, NOT ON MY
 WATCH.
 AND INNER MOBILE THAT IS BACK IN
 THE WORLD OF J.B. HUNT AND SOME
 GROUPS THAT JUST STINK
 FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU TRYING TO
 FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GET YOUR
 MONEY TO BUY THESE, EVERYONE IS
 SELLING HEALTH CARE.
 THEY ARE OBLITERATED BY A PANIC.
 AND DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE
 CRACKING DOWN ON HEALTH CARE
 COSTS AND MANY OF THEM EMBRACING
 SINGLE PAYER BUT IT IS UNLIKELY
 THE INDUSTRY WILL GET SLAMMED,
 EVEN IF BERNIE SANDERS WINS AND
 TAKES THE WHITE HOUSE AND IN A
 LANDSLIDE AND PICKS UP SENATE
 SEATS, I DON'T THINK HE'LL HAVE
 THE NUMBERS TO MAKE MEDICARE FOR
 ALL HAPPEN
 STILL THERE IS NEW POLITICAL
 RISK
 PORTFOLIO MANAGERS DON'T LIKE
 IT
 AND YOU KNOW THE PAIN IS OVER
 WHEN ELI LILLY AND REALLY GOOD
 COMPANIES HAVE MONEY COMING OUT
 AND GOING RIGHT HERE
 WHEN YOU SEE THAT MONEY POURING
 OUT OF A GROUP IT IS LOOKING FOR
 A HOME
 THAT HOME WILL HAVE ECONOMIC
 SENSITIVITY.
 WHO HAS THAT
 HOW ABOUT THE RAILS AND YOU'LL
 OF THE THINGS THAT THEY MOVE ON
 THEM
 NOW HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE.
 I'M DOING REAL SHORTHAND AND
 TRYING TO GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT OF
 THE KIND OF THINGS I DO.
 BUT IT IS THE CRAFT.
 IT IS THE CRAFT THAT I PRACTICE
 FOR 40 YEARS
 THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS TO SKIN
 THE CAT.
 THIS WORKS FOR ME AND IF YOU ARE
 A CURIOUS PERSON IT COULD WORK
 FOR YOU TOO.
 I WANT TO GO TO BARBARA IN MY
 HOME STATE OF NEW JERSEY
 Caller: HI, JIM
 I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING AND INVESTED
 IN RICK ADO, NASDAQ MELI, IT IS
 CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
 LEADING MARKET PLACE MUCH LIKE
 AMAZON AND E-BAY, IT IS
 EXPENSIVE AND VOLATILE AND MAY
 EVENTUALLY PHASE OFF AGAINST
 AMAZON
 BUT WHO HASN'T --
 I LIKE IT
 I WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
 INVESTORS WAY BACK WHEN I COULD
 INVEST
 I THINK IT IS A SWELL COMPANY.
 IT HAS BEEN SWELL AND HAD BETTER
 GROWTH THAN E-BAY.
 THAT IS A GOOD CALL BY BARBARA
 FROM NEW JERSEY.
 IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
 ECONOMIC SENSAIVITY AND PEOPLE
 ARE BAILING OUT OF HEALTH CARE,
 LOOK TO THE RAIL OPERATORS AND
 WHAT THEY MOVE AND PLUS LENNAR
 AND FORD AND WASTE MANAGEMENT.
 CSX LATEST RESULTS TELL ME THERE
 IS MONEY TO BE MADE HERE
 ON MAD TONIGHT, ONE OF THE MOST
 SCRUTINIZED STOCKS IN THE MARKET
 I'M TALKING NETFLIX.
 TIME TO ADD THIS STREAMING STAR
 TO YOUR CUE OR DID YOU MISS THE
 MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE MOVIE
 AND STILL WAITING FOR IT TO GET
 BACK
 AND DAN LOWE MAY STIR A POT WHEN
 IT COMES TO CAMPBELL'S SOUP BUT
 IS THE PROXY BATTLE SIMMERING
 AND STILL TOO HOT TO CONSIDER OR
 ALL OVER AND THEY ARE ALL
 TOGETHER IN ONE CAN.
 AND WHAT IS ON THE HORIZON FOR
 FIRST VERIZON, I HAVE THE CEO.
 SO STAY WITH CRAMER.

 CAN NETFLIX PEACEFULLY COEXIST WITH THE NEW STREAMING
 SERVICE?
 WILL PEOPLE PAY $15.99 FOR A
 SUBSCRIPTION ON TOP OF $6.99 FOR
 DISNEY AND 11.99 FOR THE YOUTUBE
 PREMIUM.
 IF YOU LISTEN TO NETFLIX
 CONFERENCE CALL I THINK THE
 ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES
 WHY?
 BECAUSE I REALIZED HOW MUCH
 CONTENT I'VE MISSED OUT ON SINCE
 THE LAST CALL THREE MONTHS AGO
 AND WHAT WAS I THINKING MISSING
 TRIPLE FRONTIER, A BEN AFFLECK
 MOVING SEEN BY 52 MILLION
 HOUSEHOLDS AND MY LOVED IT WITH
 45 MILLION OTHERS NOW I HAVE TO
 SEE IT NOW
 IF YOU LOVE KINGDOM AND THE
 PIECE WITH ZOMBIES, AND I DID
 WATCH FIRE THE GREAT OF THE
 PARTY THAT NEVER HAPPENED SO AT
 LEAST I HAD SOMETHING TO TALK
 ABOUT AND I MILKED THAT FOR
 WEEKS ON END
 FIRE FEST AND I EVEN WATCHED IT
 ON THE OTHER GUY'S SHOW.
 AND NETFLIX IS ABOUT GIVING YOU
 SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
 SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU
 COME IN ON MONDAY MORNING.
 THAT IS WHAT IT IS
 IT IS ABOUT NOT FEELING LIKE A
 SMOOTH WHEN -A STOOGE WHEN
 EVERYBODY ELSE IS WATCHING BIRD
 BOX AND THE REAL METRIC IS CAN
 WE KEEP MEMBERS HAPPY WITH THE
 IRISHMAN AND JIMMY HOFFA'S
 MURDER AND FILMED ON MY STREET
 AND IF A FAMILY LIKE SIX WANTS
 TO GO TO THE MOVIES, I BREAK OUT
 A HUNDRED.
 BUT TO WATCH PACHINO AND DENERO
 HAVE BOTH APPEARED TOGETHER IN A
 SCORE ZEZY MONEY AND MAYBE SOME
 CANDY AND YEAH AND IT COST NEXT
 TO NOTHING
 NETFLIX IS A STEAL
 IT IS NOT JUST A BARGAIN, IT IS
 WHAT I CALL A NECESSARY BARGAIN.
 AN NB.
 I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT
 WEAK DOMESTIC.
 I CARE ABOUT THE SLATE OR
 MISSING APP OR NOT SEEING THE
 IRISHMAN
 AS MY SQUAWK ON THE STREAK
 CO-HOST SAYS, I HAVE A WHOLE
 BUNCH OF HOUSES AND THEY ALL
 HAVE CABLE
 I HAVE TO HAVE CABLE
 I WENT OVER MY BILLS, ONE OF
 THEM IS $325 AND ANOTHER $270
 AND ANOTHER $225 AND TWO AT

 THE HORROR
 OF COURSE, SOME OF THAT IS HIGH
 SPEED INTERNATIONAL.
 BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE
 FOR A HANDFUL OF GAMES AND
 HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS THAT I
 NEVER WATCH TO HAVE TO GO
 THROUGH.
 I PAY THEM NOT TO HAVE TO GO
 THROUGH THEM
 I MEAN HUNDREDS OF THEM.
 THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF
 CHANNELS THAT YOU DON'T WATCH
 EITHER.   I KNOW YOU
 AND THAT IS OKAY
 I DON'T THINK THE PRICES WONDER
 HOW COULD I GET THIS DOWN.
 AND NETFLIX IS RAISING PRICES BY
 A COUPLE OF BUCKS AND SAY, WOW,
 WHAT A BARGAIN
 A NECESSARY BARGAIN.
 NB
 YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MANY
 CABLE NETWORKS EXCEPT FOR CNBC
 WHEN IT WAS CREATED YEARS AGO
 TODAY.
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY
 AND I HAVE NO DESIRE TO WATCH 85
 OF THEM.
 AND WITH NETFLIX I'M DESPERATE
 TO WATCH EVERYTHING.
 EVERYTHING THEY HAVE
 DISNEY, WHEN MY KIDS WERE
 YOUNGER.
 I DID TAKE ESPN PLUS FOR $4.99
 AND NOT THE BARGAIN IT YOU WANT
 TO WIN IN FANTASY FOOTBALL WHICH
 I ALMOST ALWAYS DO
 MY WIFE LOVES HULU SO SHE WOULD
 WATCH WHERE SHE WANTS AND SHE
 PLAYS THAT CANDY CRUSH
 WHAT IS THAT ABOUT
 IT TAKES YOUR CORTEX -I BET
 APPLE STREAMING SERVICE WILL BE
 LIKE THAT TOO.
 I DON'T RECALL ANYONE ASKING ME
 ABOUT ANYTHING ON YOUTUBE BUT I
 WISH I HAD WATCHED THAT "GAME OF
 THRONES.
 I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD CANCEL
 HBO UNTIL MY WIFE STOPS WATCHING
 IT
 $15 A MONTH.
 NOT MUCH OF A SAVING
 IN THE END NETFLIX IS CHARGING
 $15.99 AND CABLE NETWORKS COULD
 CHARGE MORE FOR WHAT I WANT AND
 IT IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS PLUS
 CANDY THAT I'LL NEVER TALK
 ABOUT.
 THAT IS WHY MY TWO MILLENNIAL
 KIDS ONLY TAKE NETFLIX AND THINK
 MOVIES AND CABLE ARE RIPOFFS AND
 DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE A SHOW.
 YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GIVE
 ME SPORTS PACKAGES WITHOUT THE
 85 CHANNELS FROM ONE TO 100 AND
 I COULD BE A CORD CUTTER AFTER
 SEEING THE CABLE BILLS
 THEY ARE NECESSARY
 AND I WOULD SAY THE SHOWS ARE
 EITHER NECESSARY OR NOR A
 BARGAIN.
 BUT THE CABLE, WHEN IT COMES TO
 CABLE, I SURE DO LIKE THEIR
 STOCKS
 MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
 MUCH MORE "MAD MONEY" AHEAD. IT
 WAS A FOOD FIGHT WITH CAMPBELLS
 AND DAN LOBE OPENS UP A SPICY
 CAN OF A PROXY BATTLE.
 AND I'LL GIVE YOU MY TAKE.
 AND I'LL TALK TO FIRST HORIZON
 AND AFTER CHEVRON COULD OTHER
 OIL STOCKS GET ON THE ACTION
 I'M EYEING THE MERGER AND
 ACQUISITION IN THE OIL PATCH SO
 STAY WITH CRAMER

 SOMETHING YOU OFTEN ASK ME ON TWITTER, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN
 YOU ARE DEALING WITH A REAL COME
 BACK IN A ONCE BEATEN DOWN STOCK
 AS TO OPPOSED TO A FLASH IN THE
 PAN THAT COULD VANISH UNDER YOUR
 FEET
 AND THAT IS THE QUESTION WE NEED
 TO ASK ABOUT
 AN ICONIC NAME TO DREDGE UP
 HERE, CAMPBELL'S SOUP.
 THE CAMPBELLS PORK AND BEANS
 THAT IS WHERE THE SYMBOL COMES
 FROM
 AND YOU KNOW FROM THE NAMESAKE
 V-8 AND SWAN SON BROTH AND THE
 BRAND.
 HERE IS A COMPANY AN ABSOLUTE
 MESS
 WE KNOW THAT THE PANTRY PLACE
 BROUGHT IN -BOUGHT IN THE
 CENTER OF THE AISLE HAVE BEEN
 STRUGGLING FOR YEARS AS YOUNGER
 PEOPLE LIKE THE STOCK THAT -A
 FRENCH ONION SOUP.
 THINK IT IS FROM WHEN -THIS IS
 LAFAYETTE.
 AND CAMPBELL'S SOUP STRUGGLING
 MORE THAN MOST
 IT WAS LAST YEAR THAT DENISE
 MORRIS LEFT THE COMPANY AND
 LEAVING THE NUMBER IN DISARRAY
 AND THE BUSINESS SEEMED
 RUDDERLESS AND THEN TWO THINGS
 HAPPENED
 THE INTERIM MANAGEMENT ANNOUNCED
 A STRATEGIC REVIEW TELLING US
 THEY WERE PUTTING ALL OPTION ON
 THE TABLE AND IN AUGUST IT
 BECAME AN IF ACTIVIST STORY.
 ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS TAKEOVER
 ARTICTS OR ACTIVISTS, DAN LOBE,
 THE HEAD OF THIRD POINT, DECIDED
 TO GET INVOLVED AND ALMOST
 IMMEDIATELY DECLARED WAR ON THE
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 HE DOESN'T LIE -DOESN'T BUY A
 LOT OF COMPANIES
 HE RECOGNIZE TAD CAMPBELL AS
 SOUP HAS BEEN AN UNDERMANAGED
 MESS WHICH IS RIGHT OUT OF THE
 GATE HE ASKED THEM TO PUT IT UP
 FOR SALE
 THE ACTIVISTS STOCK AND THE
 STORY HAS MOVING PARTS
 WE KNOW LOBE HAS A PLAN.
 BUT IS IT A GOOD PLAN?
 CAN HE CON VIBS THE BOARD OF
 DIRECTORS TO FOLLOW THE BRAND OR
 GO OVER THEIR HEADS AND APPEAL
 DIRECTLY TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND
 IF IT IS A PROXY FIGHT, CAN HE
 ACTUALLY WIN OR IS THE CURRENT
 LEADERSHIP HAVE TOO MUCH
 ENTRENCHED SUPPORT
 IN THIS CASE FROM THE FAMILY
 THAT OWNS NEARLY HALF OF THE
 COMPANY AND THEN THE MANAGEMENT.
 THEY TRY TO STRIKE A COMPROMISE.
 WILL THEY FIGHT THE INCURSION BY
 WORKING HARDER TO MAKE THE
 SHAREHOLDERS HAPPY
 THERE ARE A DOZEN POTENTIAL
 PERMEATIONS FOR CAMPBELL'S SOUP
 WHICH IS WHY WE'RE WAITING FOR
 THE SMOKE TO CLEAR BEFORE
 DIGGING DEEPER
 AND MAYBE THAT IS A MISTAKE.
 AFTER BEING CLOBBERED, THEY HAD
 A COME BACK AND UP 9% AND AS THE
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS BROUGHT IN A
 TALENTED NEW CEO AND THE LAST
 COUPLE OF QUARTERS WERE BETTER
 THAN MANY FEARS AN THE PACKAGE
 FOOD SPACE, SUDDENLY OUT OF
 NOWHERE HAS WIND ON ITS BACK
 AFTER GENERAL MILLS REPORTED A
 GOOD QUARTER AND PEPSICO THIS
 MORNING AND THE BENCHMARK AT
 2.59 THE DIVIDENDS LOOK MORE
 ATTRACTIVE
 EVEN AT 3.55% YIELD.
 SO THEY ARE PAYING YOU TO WAIT
 FOR A TURN
 SO HOW DID THEY DO IT?
 AND IS THE TURN IN THE STOCK FOR
 REAL
 FIRST YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
 WHERE CAMPBELL'S STOCK AND THE
 COMPANY IS COMING FROM
 AFTER MAKING A SERIES OF SMALL
 ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANY SWUNG
 FOR THE FENCES SNAPPING UP
 SNYDER LANCE FOR $6.1 BILLION.
 DRAMATIC OVERPAY
 WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, THINK OF
 SNYDER'S PRETZELS OR POP SECRET
 OWNED BY GENERAL MILLS AND MY
 PERSONAL FAVORITE NIP CHEESE
 NIP CHEESE
 THEY'RE REALLY GOOD FOR YOU.
 THEY'RE ORANGE
 THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ROUGHLY A
 YEAR AGO AND RIGHT OUT OF THE
 GATE THERE WERE PROBLEMS
 11 MONTHS AGO THEY REPORTED AN
 OKAY QUARTER WITH DISMAL I'DEN
 AND THEN THE CEO ANNOUNCED HER
 SUDDEN RETIREMENT.
 THERE WAS NOT MUCH ABOUT THIS
 SITUATION THAT INSPIRED
 CONFIDENCE
 SO IT WAS A SHOCK WHEN DAN LOBE
 CAME OUT IN AUGUST AND TOLD US
 THAT HIS HEDGE FUND THIRD POINT
 HAD TAKEN A 5.6% STAKE IN THE
 COMPANY.
 LOBE IMMEDIATELY CRITICIZED
 MANAGEMENT, ARGUING THAT
 CAMPBELL'S DEBT FUEL TAKEOVER
 SPREE, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU WHEN
 THEY DID THIS ONE, SNYDER'S
 LANCE, THIS WAS JUST A KILLER
 HOW MUCH DEBT THEY TOOK IN
 HE SAID THAT ACQUISITION PUT
 THEM IN A PRECARIOUS SPACE
 AND NO KIDDING
 $6.1 BILLION WORTH OF DEBT
 FOR SOMETHING THAT REALLY WAS
 NOT THAT -NO BLUE CHIP
 HOW ABOUT THAT
 HE POINTED OUT THE STOCK WAS
 BASICALLY FLAT SINCE 1996, OKAY.
 THAT IS ABOUT IT
 AND HE REALLY HAMMERED HOME LACK
 OF LEADERSHIP SAYING THE CURRENT
 CEO VACUUM REMINDS US OF
 BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S RES ONAT
 INSIGHT IF YOU FAIL TO PLAN, YOU
 ARE PLANNING TO FAIL
 BUT THE CEO STARTED A STRATEGIC
 REVIEW AND LOBE SAID THE OME
 OUTCOME IS TO SELL ITSELF
 THROUGH STRATEGIC FIRE
 THAT'S TYPICAL ACTIVIST TALK
 WE CAN'T FIX IT SO JUST SELL IT.
 BUT THAT IS ALWAYS AN UPHILL
 BATTLE
 BECAUSE YOU SEE CAMPBELL'S SOUP
 IS STILL A FAMILY BUSINESS
 A LITTLE HISTORY
 ABOUT 122 YEARS AGO A CHEMIST
 NAMED JOHN T. DURANCE INVESTED
 CONDENSED SOUP AND WENT ON TO
 RUN THE COMPANY AND BUY UP A
 CONTROLLING INTEREST
 THIS IS CONDENSED.
 YOU PUT A LOT OF TOMATOES IN
 THIS
 HE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT.
 TODAY HIS DESCENDANTS OWN 45%
 AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL AND
 THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CAPITAL
 APPRECIATION, THEY MAINLY JUST
 WENT THE DIVIDENDS
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 SHOULD WE JUST KEEP DOING IT
 UNTIL IT FALLS
 CREAM OF CELERY, IT IS MY FAVE
 AND DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY
 CELERY IN THIS
 SHOW OF HANDS?
 THANK YOU.
 LOBE GOT INVOLVED AND THE
 COMPANY AND THEN AT THE END OF
 AUGUST, THE NUMBERS WERE
 WORRISOME BUT THE GROSS MARGIN
 AFTER THE COST OF GOODS SOLD
 DECLINED AND ONCE AGAIN
 MANAGEMENT GAVE AWFUL GUIDANCE
 HOME MADE STYLE CHICKEN NOODLE
 ANY CHICKEN IN THIS?
 RICHARD.
 AT
 AT THE SAME TIME, THE COMPANY
 SAID THEY WOULD SELL CAMPBELL
 INTERNATIONAL AND THE KELSON
 GROUP AND THE MANUFACTURING
 OPERATIONS IN ASIA AND CAMPBELL
 FRESH.
 WHEN THEY BOUGHT THIS THEY CAME
 ON THE SHOW AND STARTED USING IT
 AND I USE THEIR SALAD DRESSINGS
 CONSTANTLY
 THEY'RE ALL UP TOP IN THE -IN
 THE FRIG SECTION WHY YOU MAYBE
 USE WISH BONE.
 AND A WAY, THEY HAD THIS GARDEN
 FRESH GOURMET AND THAT CUSHIONED
 THE BLOW FROM THE LOUSY
 GUIDANCE
 AT THE BEGINNING -THIS IS
 GOOD
 I'VE HAD THIS.
 I'M NOT KIDDING.
 AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER, DAN
 LOBE OFFICIALLY WANTS A PROXY
 FIGHT TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND -THE
 ENTIRE BOARD
 AND EVEN RECRUITED A DEFECTOR
 FROM THE DURANT FAMILY WHO IS
 UNHAPPY WITH THE DIRECTION OF
 THE BUSINESS
 AS DISPUTE WENT ON, THE DISPUTE
 GOT MORE AND MORE VICIOUS.
 BUT BEFORE IT GOT TOO HEATED AND
 EVERYTHING BLEW UP
 LOBE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 MADE A DEAL AT THE END OF
 NOVEMBER, IT WAS SMART
 THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ANNUAL
 MEETING LOBE GETS TWO BOARD
 SEATS WITH INPUT INTO THE NEW
 CEO.
 AND THE STORY BECAME DIFFERENT
 AND THE ACTIVISTS AND BOARD WERE
 WORKING TOGETHER AND MADE THIS
 BRILLIANT HIRE, THIS GUY NAMED
 MARK CLOUS, JOINING THE COMPANY,
 THAT SOLD PINNACLE TO PIN AGRA
 AND IT IS COME BACK WITH A
 VENGEANCE IN 2019 SO THAT IS
 SELF HELP.
 AND NOW LOOKING CLOSE TO SELLING
 THE COOKIE BUSINESS TO MONGA
 LEASE TO MAKE US ALL FAT
 THEY ARE GETTING $510 MILLION
 FOR BULL HOUSE WHICH THEY PAID A
 LOT MORE FOR AND THIS COULD BE
 THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG LETTUCE
 THAT I USED THIS ON.
 PLUS WHEN CAMPBELL'S SOUP
 REPORTED THE LATEST NUMBERS AT
 THE END OF THE FEBRUARY, THEY
 CAME IN BETTER THAN EXPECTED
 MARK CLOUS MADE IT CLEAR HE'S
 MAKING REAL PROGRESS,
 STABILIZING THE CORE BUSINESS.
 WHICH IS TRUE.
 THAT SAID I THINK SOME OF THE
 REASON THIS HAS TO DO WITH A
 SENSE OF OPTIMISM ABOUT THE DAN
 LOBE INVOLVEMENT NOW THAT HE AND
 MANAGEMENT ARE COOPERATING
 SO WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS
 STOCK?
 THEY BOUGHT EVERY LOUSY, EVERY
 BRAND.
 THEY JUST BOUGHT EVERYTHING AND
 THEY BOUGHT -REMEMBER THIS ONE
 FROM THE GUY WHO LIKE -WELL I
 CAN'T SAY WHAT HE DID TO THE
 COMPANY.
 AND THIS -REMEMBER THIS.
 AND HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE.
 AFTER SPENDING YEARS LOST IN THE
 WILDERNESS AND BUYING UP
 COMPANIES THAT NOBODY WANTED,
 CAMPBELL'S SOUP IS FINALLY
 TURNING ITSELF AROUND.
 BUT WITH THE STOCK NOW TRADING
 AT 15.7 TIMES NEXT YEAR'S
 EARNING ESTIMATES I'M NOT SURE
 HOW MUCH UPSIDE IT HAS LEFT IF
 LOBE CAN'T FIND A WAY TO
 ENGINEER A SALE.
 THE DEBT IS STACKED AGAINST THAT
 OUTCOME TO BEGIN WITH BUT THINGS
 GO SOUTH, I THINK THAT COULD
 MAKE A SALE A GENUINE
 POSSIBILITY INCLUDING CLOUS'S
 SUCCESSFUL OF PINNACLE AND WITH
 THE DIVIDEND TO WAIT FOR THE
 FAMILY TO LOSE THE RESOLVE TO
 STAY INDEPENDENT
 LET ME TAKE A QUESTION
 LET'S GO TO -LET'S GO TO
 DENNIS IN CALIFORNIA
 DENNIS
 Caller: B-B-B BOO-YAH JIM
 I'M A FIRST TIME CALLER AND I
 LIKE YOUR SHOW SO I'M THINKING
 ABOUT ADDING TO MY POSITION IN
 COSTCO
 SO I HAVE SOME RESEARCH AND I
 COME UP FROM $200 IN THE YEAR TO
 THE CURRENT PRICE OF $245.
 I ALSO THINK IT HAS TWO COUNTS
 GOING FORWARD.
 ONE IS THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND
 WHICH IT PAID IN 20 -MAY OF
 2015 AND 2017.
 RIGHT
 YEAH.
 Caller: AND THE OTHER
 CATALYST IS THE INCREASED STORE
 TRAFFIC BY HIGHER GAS PRICES AND
 PEOPLE FUEL UP AND THEN DO YOUR
 COSTCO RUN
 SO DO YOU THINK AT THIS LEVEL IT
 IS A ACCIDENT RISK ON TRADE.
 IT IS ONLY TWO POINTS OFT
 HIGH
 YOU CAN'T BUY THIS ALL AT ONCE
 THIS IS A STOCK WHERE YOU BUY
 SOME TOMORROW, AND THEN YOU BUY
 SOME ON A TRRETREAT.
 BECAUSE YOU COME IN AND BUY SOME
 AND THEN BOOM THE MARKET GOES
 DOWN AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FIRE
 POWERMENT BUT THE CONCEPTION OF
 THE IDEA, I'M ALL IN.
 THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR
 STRUGGLING CAMPBELL'S SOUP.
 AND WHILE THE FUTURE IS UNCLUR
 AND THE FUNDAMENTALS -LET'S
 CALL THEM IMPROVING.
 AND IF DAN LOBE CAN CONVINCE IT
 TO SELL ITSELF IT COULD GO
 HIGHER
 AND MUCH MORE "MAD MONEY."
 THE FED'S RATE RAISE IS OVER BUT
 I'LL TALK TO THE CEO OF A
 COMPANY AND.
 THEN DID CHEVRON ADD ENERGY
 THROUGH A PATCH AND I'M LOOKING
 FOR OTHER PLAYERS THAT COULD BE
 M&A BUYERS AND THEN TONIGHT'S
 RAPID EDITION OF "THE LIGHTNING
 ROUND.
       I consulted with your       grandmother's doctor.
           We can do the      screening at her house.

 WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME FOCUSING ON THE MAJOR NATIONAL
 BANKS AND THEY ARE DOING WELL
 BUT TAKE FIRST HORIZON, A
 TENNESSEE-BASED BANK WITH 300
 BRANCHES ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST.
 YESTERDAY MORNING THIS REGION
 REPORTED A STRONG QUARTER,
 INLINE EARNINGS AND HIGHER THAN
 EXPECTED SALES AND THE STOCK
 VAULTED 3% AND ANOTHER 1.6%
 TODAY BUT EVEN AFTER THE MOVE,
 FIRST HORIZON IS CHEAP
 SELLING FOR TEN TIMES THIS
 YEAR'S EARNING AT 1.6 TIMES THE
 BOOK VALUE
 WHAT WOULD IT BE WORTH IF THE
 PLACE IS CLOSED.
 IF IT LIQUIDATED
 SO COULD THIS STOCK HAVE MUCH
 MORE ROOM TO RUN
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT BRIAN
 JORDAN
 THE CHAIRMAN ABOUT WHERE THE
 COMPANY IS HEADING
 WELCOME BACK TO "MAD MONEY."
 THANK YOU
 IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK.
 BRIAN, IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME
 THAT THERE WAS A BANK THAT HAD
 7% LOAN GROWTH AND OVER 10%
 CUSTOMER DEPOSIT GROWTH AND ONLY
 $5 MILLION IN CHARGEOFFS, I
 WOULD TELL YOU THAT IS ABOUT AN
 18 PRICE SERIES MULTIPLE AND
 SHOULD BE ABOUT 25
 CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME
 WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS
 COUNTRY YOU HAVE THE BEST
 QUARTER I'VE SEEN AND -PEOPLE
 SAY, OH, THAT IS OKAY.
 WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
 YEAH, WE HAVE -WE DID HAVE
 A VERY GOOD QUARTER.
 WE HAVE AN INTERESTING
 ENVIRONMENT.
 I THINK AT THIS POINT THERE IS
 STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF QUESTION
 ABOUT WHETHER THIS ECONOMY IS
 GOING TO DIE OF OLD AGE AND WHAT
 THAT MEANS FOR THE FINANCIAL
 INSTITUTIONS STOCKS.
 AND IN OUR CASE WE, AS YOU KNOW,
 HAD AN INTEGRATION LAST YEAR
 THAT TOOK A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME.
 BUT I THINK WHAT WE'VE PROVEN
 OUT OVER THE LAST HALF OF 2018
 AND FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND I
 THINK WE'LL CONTINUE INTO THE
 SECOND QUARTER IS WE'RE BUILDING
 MOMENTUM
 AND WE'RE SEEING GREAT PROGRESS
 ON THE BANK WE INTEGRATED, THE
 ECONOMY IS STILL GOOD.
 AND WE'RE SEEING GOOD LOAN
 DEMAND, AND GOOD CUSTOMER
 DEPOSIT ACTIVITY
 WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT HOW
 WE'RE POSITIONED.
 SEE WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT
 AT A CERTAIN POINT AND WE WON'T
 FOCUS ON NET INTEREST INCOME OR
 MARGIN AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF
 BASIS POINTS BUT REAL GROWTH
 AND I SEE WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR
 SOUTH FLORIDA PROPERTIES OR
 HOUSTON OR THE CAROLINAS, YOU
 HAVE GENUINE GROWTH LIKE A
 GROWTH COMPANY THAT WE WOULD
 CHERISH NOT AS A INTEREST RATE
 PLAY BUT AS A COMPANY THAT IS
 GOING TO PUT UP MAYBE
 DOUBLE-DIGIT NUMBERS
 YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE
 UNIQUE FEATURES OF OUR
 ORGANIZATION
 TENNESSEE WHERE WE'VE BEEN FOR
 155 YEARS IS A GREAT MARKET AND
 GREAT GROWTH DYNAMIC
 WE EXPANDED WITH TOE HOLDS
 THROUGH CAPITAL BANK INTO NORTH
 CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA
 AND WE HAVE AN 8-YEAR-OLD
 PRESENCE OR SO IN HOUSTON,
 TEXAS.
 SO WE'VE GOT A TOE HOLD IN
 STRONG GROWTH MARKETS AND WE SEE
 A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
 OPPORTUNITY TO WIN AND GAIN
 SHARE AND TO BUILD THE BUSINESS
 AND AS I SET EARLIER, BUILD THE
 MOMENTUM.
 ARE THERE PROPERTIES FOR
 SALE
 BECAUSE YESTERDAY WE SPOKE WITH
 ANNA BOUGHTIN, CHAIRMAN OF SEND
 AIR.
 SHE'S GREAT.
 AND SHE WANTS TO EXPAND
 EVERYWHERE AND I'M THINKING
 YOU'RE IN SOUTH FLORIDA, ARE
 THERE BANKS STILL FOR SALE IN
 SOUTH FLORIDA THAT YOU COULD
 BUY?
 I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY
 ARE REGULAR WAY TRANSACTIONS
 THAT COULD GET DONE.
 I THINK THE MARKET HAS PROBABLY
 SHIFTED WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF
 BB&T AND SUN TRUST AND I THINK
 THE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE LARGER
 AND I SAID WE'RE FOCUSED ON
 EXECUTION IN 2019 AND 2020 AND
 BEYOND
 WE'RE NOT REALLY IN THE FRAME OF
 MIND WHERE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT
 ACQUISITION.
 WE WANT TO CAPITALIZE ON WHAT
 WE'VE GOT IN TERMS OF FOOT HOLD
 IN NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH
 CAROLINA, SOUTH FLORIDA AND
 BUILD MOMENTUM WITH THAT FOR THE
 SHORT-TERM
 NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT BE
 SAYING, LOOK, HE ONLY HAS
 $5 MILLION IN CHARGEOFFS BECAUSE
 NOBODY IS GETTING A LOAN WHO IS
 EVEN AT ALL RISKY.
 I THINK THAT THERE IS A NEW
 ATTITUDE POST 2008 AND '09 BUT
 YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEBTORS OR
 PEOPLE WHO WANT MONEY THAT WOULD
 BE GOOD CREDIT BUT NOT SUPER
 IT IS NOT LIKE YOU ARE NOT
 TAKING ANY RISK, IS IT
 NO, NOT AT ALL.
 WE HAVE A VERY NICE -A
 GRANULAR PORTFOLIO
 IT IS GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE
 IT IS A STRONG PORTFOLIO
 IT IS LARGELY A COMMERCIAL AND
 INDUSTRIAL LENDING PORTFOLIO SO
 IT IS COMMERCIAL ENTITIES AND
 REAL ESTATE AND THEN CONSUMER.
 I THINK RISK IS BEING MANAGED
 BETTER TODAY IN THE FINANCIAL
 SERVICES INDUSTRY THAN IT WAS
 PRE-2008, 2009
 BUT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF
 COMPETITION FOR EVERY DEAL THAT
 IS OUT THERE
 THE PRICING AND THE STRUCTURE IS
 STILL VERY GOOD FOR BORROWERS
 AND I THINK IT IS STILL SOUND
 FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
 INDUSTRY
 BUT I THINK WE'RE TAKING
 MEASURED AND BETTER RISK TODAY
 I THINK OUR PORTFOLIO TO THE
 EXTENT THAT IT EVER DOES SEE A
 DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY, WILL BE
 PESSIMISTIC AND SAY WHEN, I
 THINK OUR PORTFOLIO WILL PERFORM
 VERY WELL.
 WE'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
 OF WORK OVER TEN YEARS TO CHANGE
 OUR CREDIT PROFILE TO THIS
 GRANULAR AND DIVERSIFIED CNI
 ORIENTED PORTFOLIO WHICH I THINK
 WILL HOLD UP AND PERFORM VERY,
 VERY WELL THROUGHOUT A CHANGE IN
 ECONOMY.
 SO HOW MUCH OF WHAT YOU SAID
 IS CHANGED HAS TO DO WITH THE
 10% OF THE REVENUES THAT YOU
 SPENT ON TECHNOLOGY OR IS THAT
 MORE CUSTOMER FACING, NOT
 NECESSARILY A WAY TO BE ABLE TO
 MEASURE RISK
 YEAH, I THINK IT IS A LITTLE
 BIT OF BOTH.
 THE TECHNOLOGY SPEND IN THE
 INDUSTRY IS PROBABLY THE
 FASTEST-GROWING THING IN THE
 BUSINESS
 AND I THINK THE COST PRESSURES
 ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE WILL GO
 UP
 IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.
 IT WILL BE BACK OFFICE AND TOOLS
 TO HELP YOU DECISION CREDIT AND
 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND
 TOOLS OF THAT NATURE AND THE
 CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGIES
 THINGS LIKE REAL-TIME PAYMENTS,
 VENMO, ZEL, TECHNOLOGIES THAT
 ALLOW YOU TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT
 TOOLS AND FEATURES THAT ALLOW
 CUSTOMERS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF
 BANKING.
 HOW THEY WANT TO BANK AND WHEN
 THEY WANT TO BANK.
 AND WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
 FLEXIBILITY.
 SO WE'LL HAVE AN INCREASING
 PRESSURE ON THE TECHNOLOGY SPEND
 OVER TIME AND YOU MAY HAVE NOTED
 THAT WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF
 TIME TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE
 TRYING TO PAY FOR THAT WITH OUR
 EXISTING COST BASE SO WE'RE
 REORIENTED THE CALL STRUCTURE TO
 ENABLE US TO MAKE THE
 INVESTMENTS.
 ONE LAST QUESTION AND IT HAS
 TO BE QUICK.
 NEXT MOVE BY THE FED, RATE CUT
 OR RATE HIKE
 IF I HAD TO GUESS, I WOULD
 SAY IT IS FLAT FOR A WHILE AND
 THEN DOWN.
 WOW
 OKAY.
 WE'LL END IT THERE
 THANK YOU TO BRYAN JORDAN FROM
 CHAIRMAN AND CEO

 STOCK.

 CRUSHED.

 HEALTH CARE.

 I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, IT FEELS GOOD TO BE RIGHT
 LAST FRIDAY PACK OIM HAD A
 TAKEOVER BID FROM CHEVRON.
 VERSUS WHERE THE STOCK WENT OUT
 THE DAY BEFORE
 I CALLED IT.
 I PREDICTED THIS DEAL WOULD
 HAPPEN AND I'M BETTING IT IS THE
 FIRST OF MANY MAJOR ACQUISITIONS
 IN THE OIL AND GAS SPACE
 WHEN I SAY I CALLED IT, I'M NOT
 TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT
 WE'VE OWNED IT BUT FOLLOW ALONG
 BY JOIN THE CLUB
 HONESTLY, THAT IS NOTHING TO
 BRAG ABOUT
 AND IT HAS BEEN AN AGONIZING
 POSITION BECAUSE BEFORE CHEVRON
 CAME ALONG THE STOCK SPENT
 MONTHS AND MONTHS --
 THE HOUSE OF PAIN.
 IT IS GOOD TO BUST OUT OF MY
 PERSONAL SHAWSHANK
 BUT STILL THREE WEEKS AGO I DID
 MAKE A SHOT AND EXPLAINED THIS
 MARKET WAS IN NEED OF
 ACQUISITIONS AND WE HAVE TOO
 MANY PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES
 AND WILL GET WORSE AS MORE AND
 MORE PRIVATELY HELD UNICORNS
 LIKE PINTEREST BECOME PUBLIC
 AND THAT IS THE POINT I WAS
 MAKING WHEN I TALKED ABOUT
 POTENTIAL TAKEOVER TARGETS
 TAKE A LOOK.
 THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY OIL
 COMPANIES.
 I THINK THE MID-SIZE NEED TO
 BAND TOGETHER TO CUT COSTS
 APACHE AND ANNA DARKA MAKE MOST
 SENSE.
 THAT CRAMER GUY HAS GOOD IDEAS
 WHY DID I THINK IT WAS A NATURAL
 TAKEOVER TARGET?
 I'LL LET HIM EXPLAIN.
 ANADARKO WOULD BE GOOD FIT
 FOR THE MAJORS
 IT HAS HOLDINGS ALL OVER THE
 WORLD BUT DINGED BY HIGHER
 PRODUCTION COSTS WHICH PREDICTED
 TO THE 40% EARNINGS MISS THAT
 GUTTED THE STOCK IN FEBRUARY
 SO IT WAS AN ATTRACTIVE TAKEOVER
 PRODUCT.
 WHEN THE NEWS BROKE, ONE ANALYST
 JOKED THAT, AFTER 30 YEARS OF
 TAKEOVER SPECULATION, IT IS
 GETTING ACQUIRED
 ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID AND NEVER A
 BRIDE UNTIL NOW.
 THIS IS A BIGGER GAME-CHANGER
 THAN ANYONE IS SAYING.
 IT REALLY IS
 AND FOR CHEVRON, THE LARGEST
 PRODUCER IN THE BASIN AN AREA OF
 TEXAS OVERFLOWING WITH OIL THAT
 IS SUPER CHEAP TO GET OUT OF THE
 GROUND, IT IS A BIG DEAL
 BUT WE HAVE TO ASK, WHO IS NEXT?
 BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW, BUT
 WHAT IS THE NEXT COMPANY
 AND I'M EXTREMELY CONFIDENT
 WE'LL SEE MORE CONSOLIDATION IN
 THE OIL INDUSTRY
 THE SAME THAT MADE IT A SWEET
 BUY FOR CHEVRON MEANS THAT THE
 RIVALS WOULD BE TERRIFIC
 TAKEOVER FOR THE OIL COMPANIES
 THAT WANT TO SIMMER DOWN BEFORE
 I COME OUT WITH THE PIECE BUT
 I'M PREDICTING COMPANIES WILL
 GOBBLE UP BY THE INTEGRATED OR
 LARGER EMP
 WHY IS THAT?
 FOR STARTERS, WE HAVE WAY TOO
 MANY OIL PRODUCER AND ONE DEAL
 DOES NOT CHANGE THAT
 OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THE
 PRICE OF CRUDE HAS BEEN STUCK
 BETWEEN THE MID-40s AND MID-70s.
 EVERY TIME WE APPROACH THE HIGH
 END COMPANIES PRODUCE THE OIL
 PRODUCTION AND PRICES COME BACK
 DOWN
 BUT ONE A COMPANY GETS MERGED
 OUT, THE REMAINING PLAYERS ADD
 NEW CAPACITY
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, THESE OIL
 PRODUCERS, ESPECIALLY THE ONES
 IN THE PERMIAN BASIN ARE
 COMPETING FOR RESOURCES AND A
 LIMITED SUPPLY OF PIPELINE AND
 LABOR.
 CONSOLIDATION COULD CONTAIN THE
 COSTS.
 AND THE MORE OBVIOUS, MULTIPLE
 BIDDERS FOR ANADARKO
 THANKS TO FANTASTIC REPORTING
 FROM MY "SQUAWK ON THE STREET"
 TEAM, WE KNOW THAT OXY PETROLEUM
 TRIED TO BUY THEM AND THE OFFER
 WAS HIGHER THAN CHEVRON'S $65
 SHARE BID.
 AND THEY SAID THEY WERE WILLING
 TO PAY IN THE MID-70s PER SHARE,
 INCLUDING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF
 STOCK AND IT SEEMS LIKE ANNA
 DARKA WOULD HAVE THEM BETTER
 THAN CHEVRON
 BUT WE DO KNOW THAT OX DENTAL
 WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL AND CAME
 WITHIN INCHES OF GETTING
 ANADARKO
 THEY HAVE THE FIRE POWER LINED
 UP AND I BET THEY ARE NOT THE
 ONLY ONE WITH THE FIRE POWER
 ONCE THE ACQUISITION CLOSES,
 CHEVRON WILL BECOME NEARLY AS
 LARGE AS EXXON-MOBIL AND SHELL
 IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION
 I DON'T THINK EXXON WANTS TO SEE
 THE CROWD WITHOUT A FIGHT.
 THEY HAVE -WELL OXY HAS
 CLAIMED THEY HAVE THE PERMIAN
 CROWN AND ALL OF THE COMPANIES
 ARE FAR AND AWAY THE LARGEST OIL
 AND GAS FORMATION EVER IN THE
 U.S.
 AND SO MUCH OF THAT STUFF IS SO
 EASY TO GET OUT OF THE GROUND.
 IT HAS PIPES AND EVERYTHING.
 AND IF THEY COULD BULK UP THE
 BUSINESS BY BUYING AN
 INDEPENDENT THAT WOULD MAKE A
 TON OF SENSE
 SO WHICH INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS
 WOULD MAKE THE MOST OBVIOUS
 TARGETS.
 I'LL GIVE THEM TO YOU.
 WRITE THEM DOWN.
 LAST ONE IS PROBABLY BEST BUT
 ALL OF THESE WILL PROBABLY
 HAPPEN
 THE FIRST IS APACHE.
 THEN CONCHO AND PARSLEY AND
 PIONEER.
 AND LET'S START WITH APACHE.
 USED TO BE MUCH HIGHER AND EGYPT
 AND A GOOD PLACE AND IN THE
 NORTH SEA OFF THE COAST OF THE
 BRITAIN.
 MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY HAVE A
 TON OF EXPOSURE TO THE PERMIAN
 BASIN BUT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN
 INCONSISTENT PRODUCER.
 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE LEARNED
 OF A MAJOR NEW DISCOVERY, ALPINE
 HIGH BUT NOT LIVED UP TO THE
 EXPECTATIONS
 THE HYPE WAS TERRIBLE.
 AND PROBABLY BECAUSE THE
 PROPERTY TURNED OUT TO BE LESS
 OILY AND MORE GASSY AND OIL IS
 MORE VALUABLE THAN GAS
 THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THE DARK
 STUFF.
 BUT STILL APACHE STOCK HAS COME
 DOWN TO RIDICULOUSLY LOW LEVELS.
 THIS IS $101 STOCK FIVE YEARS
 AGO AND IT BOTTOMED AT $25 AT
 CHRISTMAS.
 I THINK IT HAS MORE UPSIDE
 YOU HAVE TO LIKE NATURAL GAS
 AND THEY DO HAVE A DEBT-LADEN
 BALANCE SHEET AND I THINK THIS
 IS THE PRODUCER THAT MIGHT BE
 WORTH MORE TO EXXON ON ON ITS
 OWN.
 AND NEXT UP CONCHO
 IT IS TRANSFORMED INTO A NICE
 EASY TO UNDERSTAND WELL-RUN AND
 PURE PLAY IN THE PERMIAN BASIN
 IF I'M RUNNING OXY DENTAL I
 WOULD BE SALIVATED BUT THEY'VE
 BEEN WORKING HARD TO CREATE A
 STRAIGHTFORWARD BEST OF BREED
 COMPANY AND WITH THE CLEANER
 STRUCTURE, CONCHO IS IN A
 TERRIFIC POSITION TO COIN MONEY
 AND FOR THE RIGHT PRICE MAYBE
 THEY AGREE TO BE ACQUIRED AND
 OVERALL 6.6% AND [ INAUDIBLE ]
 AND THEY HAVE GOOD HOLDINGS
 ACROSS TWO OF THE BEST SUB AREAS
 OF THE PERMIAN AND I THINK THEY
 ARE POISED TO TRANSITION FROM
 HEAVY INVESTMENT TO TREMENDOUS
 PROFITS AND PLUS A BITE SIZE
 TAKEOVER TARGET AND STOCK IS
 CHEAP AT 5 FINALSE EARNINGS AND
 THE BEST ONE IS LAST, PIONEER
 NATURAL.
 IT WOULD BE A MAJOR DEAL IF IT
 WAS BOUGHT
 PERHAPS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT
 THAN ANADARKO.
 DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE
 PREMIUM.
 THIS IS RIGHT IN THE CROSS-HAIRS
 AND IT DEFINITELY, I THINK, THE
 BEST OF THESE FOUR COMPANIES
 NOW PIONEER'S FOUNDING CEO SCOTT
 SHEFFIELD STEPPED DOWN IN 2016
 HANDING THE REIN TO JIM DUB BE
 ANNOUNCED THE RETIREMENT AFTER A
 HIDEOUS QUARTER.
 IT WAS ABRUPT AND SHOCKING
 WHO IS E.R.A. PLACING HIM?
 65-YEAR-OLD SHEFFIELD.
 I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE
 WANTS TO PUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS
 UP FOR SALE.
 AND I'M NOT ALONE THERE.
 AND THERE IS A REASON IT JUMP

 I LOVE THIS COMPANY.
 SHEFFIELD MADE BRILLIANT
 ACQUISITIONS AND SUCH A SMART
 GUY.
 THINK A TACIT NEGOTIATOR, HE'LL
 GET THE HIGHEST PRICE IF HE DOES
 SELL
 BOTTOM LINE, ANNA DARKA WON'T BE
 THE LASTOND SO I LIKE APACHE AND
 CONCHO AND PARSLEY AND PIE --
 PIE ON EAR AND EVEN IF THEY
 DON'T NEED CONSOLIDATION I THINK
 PIONEER SHEFFIELD WILL FIND A
 WAY TO MAKE MONEY FOR YOU.
 STICK WITH CRAMER.
