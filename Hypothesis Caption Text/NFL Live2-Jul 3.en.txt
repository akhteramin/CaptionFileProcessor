 IT RIGHT WAS THE SQUAD ITSELF. AFTER THE GAME, THEY POASTD A
 VIDEO OF MOST OF THE TEAM
 DANCING TO THE 2007 BANGER.
 IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT, THAT
 SUCKS FOR YOU.
 BUT THE FACT THAT THIS SONG IS
 WHAT BRINGS THIS TEAM TOGETHER
 IS AMAZING.
 IN THE NAME OF THE GROUP WHO
 MADE IT, PROBABLY DESCRIBED
 BOTH COUNTRIES' HISTORIES OF
 MONEY MAKING QUITE WELL, CRIME
 MOB.
 GOD BLESS THEM, AND GOD BLESS
 AMERICA.
 "NFL LIVE" IS NEXT.
 WE'RE BACK ON JULY 11.


 "NFL LIVE" PACKED WITH
 SPECIAL GUEST STARS TODAY.
 JAGUARS QUARTERBACK JALEN RAMSEY
 JOINS THE SHOW LIVE.
 TALK ABOUT HOW THE JAGS BOUNCE
 BACK THIS YEAR.
 WE'LL TALK TO BROWNS TIGHT END
 DAVID NJOKU ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT
 IN CLEVELAND AND WHAT'S AHEAD
 FOR THE BROWNS.
 SINCE TOMORROW IS INDEPENDENCE
 DAY, WE'LL SHOW YOU SOME OF OF
 THE BEST INDEPENDENT PLAYS IN
 NFL HISTORY.
 YOU'LL WANT TO STICK AROUND TO
 FIND OUT IF ONLY WHAT YOU
 NEED -IF YOU CAN'T GET YOUR
 HOLIDAY WEEKEND STARTED WITHOUT
 HEARING 90 MORE MINUTES OF
 OFF-SEASON CONTENT, YOU HAVE
 COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
 DAVE GRAZIANO HERE.
 WE'LL START WITH THE SITUATION
 REGARDING EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
 THE COWBOYS SUPERSTAR RUNNING
 BACK MET TUESDAY WITH ROGER
 GOODELL TO DISCUSS A RECENT
 INCIDENT INVOLVING ELLIOTT AND A
 SECURITY GUARD IN LAS VEGAS.
 ELLIOTT WAS DETAINED BUT NOT
 ARRESTED.
 GIVEN HIS HISTORY WITH THE
 PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY, THE
 COMMISSIONER CALLED HIM IN FOR A
 DISCUSSION.
 FOLLOWING THAT DISCUSSION,
 ELLIOTT POSTED THE FOLLOWING
 STATEMENT ON TWITTER.
 EARLIER TODAY I MET WITH THE
 COMMISSIONER TO SHARE WITH HIM
 WHAT OCCURRED IN LAS VEGAS AND
 WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THAT
 INCIDENT.
 I'VE WORKED HARD TO MAKE BETTER
 DECISIONS AND LIVE UP TO THE
 HIGH STANDARDS EXPECTED OF ME.
 I FAILED TO DO THAT HERE AND I
 MADE A POOR DECISION.
 I APOLOGIZED TO KYLE JOHNSON,
 THAT'S THE SECURITY GUARD IN
 QUESTION AT THE TIME AND I MEANT
 IT.
 I NEED TO WORK HARDER TO ENSURE
 I DO NOT PUT MYSELF IN
 COMPROMISED SITUATIONS IN THE
 FUTURE.
 I AM REDEDICATING MYSELF TO USE
 ALL THE RESOURCES THE LEAGUE HAS
 MADE AVAILABLE.
 IN THE END, IT'S UP TO ME AND I
 AM DETERMINED NOT TO BE IN THIS
 POSITION AGAIN.
 WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL?
 PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE WARNING
 COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL
 ISSUED TO ELLIOTT WHEN HE
 SUSPENDED HIM IN 2017.
 IN HIS SUSPENSION LETTER AT THAT
 TIME, GOODELL WROTE TO ELLIOTT,
 YOU MUST HAVE NO FURTHER ADVERSE
 INVOLVEMENT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT
 AND MUST NOT COMMIT ANY
 ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS OF LEAGUE
 POLICY.
 YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT
 ANOTHER VIOLATION MAY RESULT IN
 YOUR SUSPENSION OR POTENTIAL
 BANISHMENT FROM THE NFL.
 LOOK, WE'RE NOT HERE TO MAKE
 EQUATIONS OR COMPARISONS TO WHAT
 HE DID IN THE PAST AND WHAT HE
 DID NOW.
 HERE HE IS MAKING THE WRONG
 HEADLINES AGAIN.
 BEING CALLED INTO THE
 COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE, NO SMALL
 THING FOR A PLAYER IN HIS
 SITUATION.
 MIKE, IF YOU'RE IN THE FRONT
 OFFICE OF THIS TEAM AND YOU HAVE
 A PLAYER IN THIS SITUATION, GOT
 THE CONTRACT SITUATION COMING UP
 OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS,
 WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATION DO YOU
 NEED TO HAVE WITH HIM AT THIS
 TIME.
 YOU NEED TO HAVE A DIRECT,
 HONEST AND VERY DIFFICULT
 CONVERSATION.
 YOU HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW THAT
 THIS BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE
 AND THIS IS MORE THAN ONE
 INSTANCE.
 AS YOU SAID, DAN, MAYBE IT'S NOT
 AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE ONE THAT
 HAPPENED IN THE PAST, BUT FROM
 THE COWBOY ORGANIZATION, I WOULD
 TELL HIM, LOOK WE'RE GOING TO
 HIT PAUSE ON YOUR CONTRACT
 NEGOTIATIONS.
 THERE'S FOUR OTHER PLAYERS RIGHT
 NOW THAT THE COWBOYS HAVE, DAK
 PRESCOTT, THEIR STARTING
 QUARTERBACK, AMARI COOPER WHO
 THEY TRADED FOR FROM THE OAKLAND
 RAIDERS, JAYLEN SMITH AND BYRON
 JONES.
 ALL FOUR OF THOSE PLAYERS ARE
 GOING FOR THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR
 RESPECTIVE CONTRACTS.
 THEY HAVE PLAYED WELL AND ACTED
 FLAWLESSLY OFF THE FIELD.
 I HAVE HAD THAT CONVERSATION
 WITH EZEKIEL ELLIOTT TO SAY
 WHILE WE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE
 DONE ON THE FIELD, RIGHT NOW
 YOU'RE UNDER CONTRACT FOR THIS
 YEAR.
 WE HAVE THE OPTION FOR 2020 AND
 WE CAN FRANCHISE YOU THE YEAR
 AFTER.
 BASICALLY FOR THE NEXT THREE
 YEARS WE CAN CONTROL YOUR
 RIGHTS.
 BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU'VE ACTED,
 WE'RE HITTING PAUSE AROUND IT
 MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT TO
 HEAR, BUT THAT'S THE
 CONVERSATION YOU NEED TO HAVE
 WITH THE PLAYER.
 STANDPOINT OF A TEAMMATE, A
 GUY LIKE THIS IN THIS SITUATION,
 WHAT CONVERSATION DO YOU HAVE?
 LISTEN, I THINK IT'S
 IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE AVAILABLE.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF THE
 GUY WHO BASICALLY STIRS THE
 DRINK ISN'T AVAILABLE, YOU'RE
 AFFECTING MY MONEY.
 YOU'RE AFFECTING EVERYBODY IN
 THE ORGANIZATION.
 THINK ABOUT IT.
 JASON GARRETT, THIS IS LIKE HIS
 CONTRACT YEAR, THIS IS HIS YEAR,
 DO OR DIE YEAR AND YOU'RE
 PUTTING YOURSELF -YOU'RE
 EZEKIEL ELLIOTT, YOU'RE PUTTING
 YOURSELF IN A COMPROMISING
 SITUATION WHERE YOU COULD BE
 POTENTIALLY SUSPENDED ACHBD NOT
 AVAILABLE TO THE TEAM.
 THERE'S SO MUCH RIDING ON THE
 DALLAS COWBOYS THIS YEAR, IT'S
 ALL HANDS ON DECK.
 IF I'M A VETERAN IN THE LOCKER
 ROOM, LIKE, DUDE, LET'S CHILL
 OUT, CALM DOWN, CAN'T KEEP
 PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE
 BECAUSE YOU'RE HURTING
 EVERYBODY, NOT JUST YOURSELF.
 DAMIAN, TO YOUR POINT HOW
 EZEKIEL ELLIOTT STIRS THE DRINK.
 LOOK AT DAK PRESCOTT, HE HAS A
 PASSER RATING OF 122 WHEN IT'S
 PLAY ACTION, THE REASON IT'S
 EFFECTIVE IS THE OPPOSING
 DEFENSE IS WORRYING ABOUT
 EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
 THAT IS NOT BY COINCIDENCE THAT
 HAS A HIGH PASSING RATING WHEN
 THEY'RE IN PLAY ACTION.
 BECAUSE EVERYTHING WILL BE KEYED
 ON EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
 IF HE'S NOT AVAILABLE -AMARI
 COOPER WAS A VERY VALUABLE
 ACQUISITION.
 WITHOUT EZEKIEL ELLIOTT, THAT
 OFFENSE IS A LOT EASIER TO
 DEFEND.
 NO QUESTION OBVIOUSLY ABOUT
 THE IMPORTANCE OF EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT TO THE COWBOYS OFFENSE,
 THEY STRUGGLED WITHOUT HIM IN
 2017 WHEN HE WAS SUSPENDED.
 WE AWAIT WORD FROM THE
 COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WHETHER HE
 FACES DISCIPLINE FOR THIS
 INCIDENT.
 IF THAT COMES IN THE NEXT HOUR
 AND A HALF, WE'LL BRING IT TO
 YOU.
 IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE GOING TO
 MOVE ON TO THE SILLIER PORTION
 OF YOUR SHOW.
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 THE 243rd ANNIVERSARY OF THE
 SIGNING OF DECLARATION OF
 INDEPENDENCE.
 WE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOMAS
 JEFFERSON, WE HAVE DAMIAN WOODY
 AND MIKE TANNENBAUM.
 EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE
 BEEN THE FIRST CHOICE ON
 DECLARATION, JEFFERSON COULDN'T
 MAKE IT, WE'VE DECIDED TO ASK
 THEM FOR DECLARATIONS OF THEIR
 OWN.
 WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE IS
 SOMETHING YOU FEEL STRONGLY
 ABOUT, SOMETHING YOU FEEL LIKE
 DECLARING ABOUT THE UPCOMING NFL
 SEASON.
 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT
 LIFE, LIBERTY OR THE PURSUIT OF
 APP HAPPINESS.
 IT HAS TO BE ABOUT FOOTBALL.
 DAMIAN, WHAT'S YOUR FIRST
 DECLARATION OF THE DAY?
 KIRK COUSINS WILL BE THE
 FIRST QUARTERBACK IN THE NFC
 NORTH THIS YEAR.
 WHOA.
 YES.
 I'M GOING OUT THERE ON KIRK
 COUSINS AND THE MINNESOTA
 VIKINGS.
 I LOVE WHAT THE VIKINGS DID IN
 THE DRAFT.
 ADDING A COUPLE PIECES UP FRONT
 IN THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
 THEY HAVE ARGUABLY THE BEST WIDE
 RECEIVER TANDEM.
 THEY DRAFTED IRV SMITH.
 TIGHT END FROM ALABAMA TO GO
 ALONG WITH KYLE RUDOLPH.
 EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW IS READY
 MADE.
 MIKE T. IS TRYING TO JUMP IN ON
 THIS.
 I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM.
 I AM ADAMANT RIGHT NOW THAT KIRK
 COUSINS IS GOING TO GET IT DONE
 IN THE NFC NORTH THIS YEAR.
 DON'T MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL,
 KIRK COUSINS.
 THE NFL CONSTITUTIONAL
 CRISIS.
 I GOT TWO WORDS.
 AARON RODGERS.
 I UNDERSTAND AARON RODGERS
 AND NFC NORTH.
 I GOT MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT FOR
 AARON RODGERS.
 BUT I ALSO LOOK AT THIS.
 WHAT DID THE GREEN BAY PACKERS,
 HOW MUCH ADDITION DID THE
 PACKERS ADD TO AARON RODGERS,
 THEIR OFFENSE TO HELP AARON
 RODGERS THIS UPCOMING YEAR?
 NOT MUCH.
 I DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING
 THIS YEAR.
 LIKE I SAID, WITH KIRK
 COUSINS, THIS IS THE YEAR IN
 GETTING PAID A BOATLOAD OF
 MONEY.
 THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS DRAFTED
 GUYS UP FRONT TO HELP THE
 OFFENSIVE LINE.
 I THINK THIS IS THE YEAR THAT
 KIRK COUSINS MAKES A STATEMENT
 IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
 IF HE DOES, WHAT DOES THAT
 MEAN FOR THE VIKINGS?
 HOW FAR CAN THEY TAKE IT?
 THEY CAN GO TO THE SUPER
 BOWL.
 OH, BOY.
 IF YOU HAVE --
 IF THAT'S HOW WE DO
 DECLARATIONS --
 IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED IT
 OUT, I'M PRETTY BULLISH ON THE
 MINNESOTA VIKINGS.
 DAMIAN, WE KNOW THE SIGN OF A
 GREAT PLAYER WHEN THEY MAKE
 EVERYBODY AROUND THEM BETTER.
 AARON RODGERS, THAT HE COULD
 ELEVATE THE PLAY OF HIS
 TEAMMATES.
 I AGREE MINNESOTA HAS HAD A GOOD
 OFF-SEASON.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, ISN'T
 AARON RODGERS THE BETTER PLAYER
 THAN KIRK COUSINS.
 COUSINS HAS THE HIGHEST
 COMPLETION PERCENTAGE THAN ANY
 NFC NORTH QUARTERBACK.
 HE WAS ONLY 1-6-1 AGAINST TEAMS
 WITH WINNING RECORDS.
 OBVIOUSLY, GOT TO DO BETTER THAN
 THAT.
 MIKE TANNENBAUM, WHAT IS YOUR
 DECLARATION.
 KYLE MURRAY WILL NOT PLAY
 IN -HIS PLAY STYLE IS SIMILAR
 TO MARCUS MARIOTA.
 MARCUS MARIOTA, THROUGHOUT HIS
 CAREER, NEVER PLAYED IN 16
 GAMES.
 WHILE KYLER MURRAY IS A DYNAMIC
 ATHLETE BECAUSE OF HIS BUILD, I
 THINK AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING
 TO BE HARD FOR HIM TO ANSWER THE
 BELL AT SOME SUNDAY THIS SEASON
 AND I CAN SEE HIM MISSING AT
 LEAST ONE GAME.
 MY DECLARATION IS KYLER MURRAY,
 BASED ON HIS SIZE, BASED ON THE
 WAY HE PLAYS, HE WILL NOT PLAY
 IN 16 GAMES.
 A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT
 KYLER MURRAY.
 IN ARIZONA THE FIRST YEAR.
 HE IS A SCRAMBLER.
 HE SCRAMBLED 41 TIMES, NINTH
 MOST OF ANY FBS QUARTERBACK.
 THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF HIS
 GAME.
 THEY SAY THAT THAT HELPS WHEN
 THERE ARE QUESTIONS ON THE
 OFFENSIVE LINE.
 DO YOU BUY IT OR DO THEY NEED TO
 BE BETTER UP FRONT?
 NO, THEY NEED TO BE BETTER UP
 FRONT.
 I'M A BIG BELIEVER, FOOTBALL
 ISN'T COMPLICATED.
 YOU GOT TO BLOCK, YOU GOT TO
 TACKLE, CATCH AND ALL THOSE
 TYPES OF THINGS.
 WHAT WE SAW FROM THE ARIZONA
 CARDINALS LAST YEAR, THEY
 COULDN'T BLOCK THEIR WAY OUT OF
 A WET PAPER BAG.
 THIS IS GOING TO BE -THIS IS
 GOING TO BE A SITUATION THAT
 BEARS WATCHING AS FAR AS KYLER
 MURRAY AND PROTECTING MOVING
 FORWARD.
 BY THE WAY, WE HEARD THE SAME
 SPIEL WHEN I WAS TRYING TO SIGN
 DAMIAN WOODY.
 HE REMINDED US HOW IMPORTANT THE
 OFFENSIVE LINE IS.
 YEAH.
 LISTEN, THE TAPE DON'T LIE.
 TAPE DOESN'T LIE.
 I LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF
 DAMIAN.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 WE GOT MORE DO, THOUGH.
 COMING UP ON "NFL LIVE," AS WE
 MENTIONED EARLIER, INDEPENDENCE
 DAY IS TOMORROW.
 WE'RE NOT ON THE AIR TOMORROW.
 WE'RE GOING TO CELEBRATE A DAY
 EARLY WITH THE NFL'S MOST
 INDEPENDENT PLAYS.
 LOOKING AT THE GUYS WHO CAN DO
 IT ALL BY THEMSELVES.
 SPEAKING OF DOING IT ALL, CAM
 NEWTON MAY BE REHABBING HIS
 THROWING ARM, BUT THAT DOESN'T
 MEAN HE CAN'T CATCH.
 WHICH QUARTERBACK HAS THE BEST
 HANDS?
 DAMIAN WOODY IS GOING TO TAKE A
 SHOT AT RANKING THOSE.
 JALEN RAMSEY, HAS HE CHANGED HIS
 WAYS?
 WE'LL BRING HIM IN LIVE.
 HE'LL TELL US.
 I GO OUT THERE WITH A LITTLE
 FLAG.
 SOMETIMES I GO OUT THERE AND LET
 THE RECEIVER KNOW THIS IS GOING
 TO BE A LONG GAME, YOU'RE TRASH
 COMPARED TO ME.
   I got a very, very small loan          from my father.
    You gotta start somewhere.
        I'm a reporter for        The New York Times.
       The when, the where  bank statements, tax returns,
 it's out, dozens of copy records      of deeds and reports.
      1995 showed that he was          bleeding money.
        Go through it all,        understand it all
             Holy sh**
         Number by number,          brick by brick.
     That's when we realized.
           That's fraud.
      I built this empire and        I did it by myself.
         New for summer,
    it's Bud Light Lemon Tea.           That's fraud.
   Brewed with REAL lemon peels
   and aged on REAL tea leaves.
         Yes, it's real.
     No, you're not dreaming.
       Hey, don't do that.

          In every trip,      there's room for more

            I switched to MiraLAX             for my constipation.
             <i> Stimulant laxatives</i>            <i> forcefully stimulate</i>
       <i> the nerves in your colon.</i>
              <i> MiraLAX works with</i>               <i> the water in your</i>
            <i> body to unblock your</i>               <i> system naturally.</i>

        So I can buy from
 Enterprise Car Sales and you'll take ANY trade-in?
          That's right!
              Great!
          Here you go...
       Well, it does need       to be a vehicle.
     But I need this out of     my house.

 Announcer: "NFL LIVE" IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PIZZA HUT.
 NO ONE OUT-PIZZAS THE HUT.
 IT'S SOMETHING THAT MY MOM
 WARNS ME ABOUT.
 YOU ONLY GET ONE SET OF TEETH.
 FROM EAR TO EAR, HE'S ALWAYS
 SMILING.
 HE'S ALWAYS KIDDING AROUND
 AND KEEPING IT LIGHT.
 IF I'M FEELING GOOD, I KNOW THAT
 IT'S GOING TO BE CONTAGIOUS
 ENOUGH AROUND OTHERS.
 CAM NEWTON IS SMILING BECAUSE
 HE'S AWESOME.
 HE CAN RUN AND THROW AND
 APPARENTLY HE CAN CATCH.
 RECENTLY SHOWING UP, ONE HAND
 BEHIND HIS BACK.
 ODELL BECKHAM HAS NOTHING ON
 CAM.
 SO I KNOW DAMIAN ALWAYS SAYS WE
 DON'T GIVE QUARTERBACKS ENOUGH
 ATTENTION AROUND HERE.
 QUARTERBACK CATCHES OF
 ALL-TIME.
 THIS MOHAMED SANU CATCH.
 LOOK AT THE REST OF THE WAY, TO
 THE END ZONE.
 THE SWEET DIVE TO THE PYLON.
 MOST PLACES.
 ANDREW LUCK IN COLLEGE.
 HE HAD A COUPLE TARGETS LAST
 SEASON.
 LOOK AT THIS ONE-HANDED CATCH HE
 MADE AT STANFORD.
 LOOK AT THAT FOOT INBOUNDS.
 NOT A CATCH IN THE NFL.
 NOT A CATCH IN THE NFL.
 GOT TO DRAG IT.
 THESE ARE GREAT ATHLETES.
 THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR THERE.
 BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING
 TO HAVE TOO MUCH OF THAT.
 HOW COULD WE FORGET.
 QUARTERBACK, SUPER BOWL
 HISTORY, NICK FOLES IS ACTING
 JOB MIECHB MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN
 THE CATCH ITSELF.
 WHAT A MOMENT.
 ALL-TIME MOMENT IN NFL AROUND
 CERTAINLY EAGLES HISTORY.
 OBVIOUSLY QUARTERBACKS ARE
 ALL-AROUND ATHLETES TOO IN SOME
 CASES.
 I KNOW, I KNOW.
 IT HURT YOU.
 IT HURTS TO GIVE THIS MUCH
 PRAISE TO QUARTERBACKS.
 HERE WE ARE.
 JULY 3rd.
 WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.
 WE'RE GOING TO GRIND OUT THIS
 CONTENT.
 DAMIAN, I WANT YOUR LIST OF THE
 MOST VERSATILE QUARTERBACKS
 CURRENTLY PLAYING IN THE NFL.
 NUMBER 5, WE'RE GOING TO
 START WITH THIS BIG GUY RIGHT
 HERE.
 JOSH ALLEN.
 THE THING I LIKE -TALKING
 ABOUT HIS CANNON ARM.
 I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS AN OLYMPIC
 HURDLER AS WELL.
 JUMPING OVER THE MINNESOTA
 VIKING DEFENDER THERE.
 THAT WAS A HUGE PLAY IN THAT
 BUFFALO BILLS WIN UP IN
 MINNESOTA LAST YEAR.
 SO THIS DUDE IS A TREMENDOUS
 ATHLETE.
 LOOK FOR HIM TO HAVE A BIG YEAR
 THIS YEAR.
 HE LED THE BILLS RUSHING.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 EVERYTHING THAT DAMIAN SAID,
 HE'S BIG, STRONG, CAN MAKE ALL
 THE THROWS.
 HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW
 TO CORRAL THAT IN SO HE CAN PLAY
 A FULL SEASON.
 HE'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF
 HITS.
 YOU MEAN PLAY QUARTERBACK.
 NUMBER 4 RIGHT HERE.
 WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH MITCHELL
 TRUBISKY.
 I ALWAYS WANT TO CALL MITCHELL
 VICK.
 HE LOOKS LIKE -GOES ALL THE
 WAY BACK TO THE -THIS PLAY
 HERE AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND
 PATRIOTS, YOU WATCH THIS GUY
 RUN, HE'S A REALLY GOOD ATHLETE,
 HE CAN RUN WITH THE FOOTBALL IN
 HIS HANDS.
 DANGEROUS IN RUNNING THE
 FOOTBALL AGAIN.
 HE TAKES OFF IN THE POCKET.
 HE'S PULLING AWAY FROM PEOPLE
 HERE.
 SO LISTEN THE DEFENSE GOT TO
 DEFEND BOTH OF THE ASPECTS OF
 THE QUARTERBACK, MAKES IT
 AWFULLY HUFF.
 THE OFFENSIVE PLAY TO HIS
 STRENGTH.
 A LOT THE ANDY REID CONCEPT.
 THAT'S A HARD OFFENSE TO DEFEND.
 NUMBER 3.
 NUMBER 3.
 I CAN DO BOTH.
 GOT BIG BEN HERE.
 WE ALL KNOW BIG BEN IS A FUTURE
 HALL OF FAMER.
 HOW MUCH THIS, PLAYING
 SITUATIONAL FOOTBALL.
 WE TALK ABOUT SITUATIONAL
 FOOTBALL DOWNED THE BALL INSIDE
 THE 1 YARD LINE.
 HUGE PLAY AGAIN.
 BIG BEN SHOWING OFF WITH ANOTHER
 BOOT PUNT.
 SETTING IT UP RIGHT HERE.
 SETTING UP WITH THE SPECIAL
 TEAMS.
 NOT ONLY GO OUT THERE -SET
 YOUR FIELD POSITION UP.
 GET PAID.
 HE MUST ENJOY THAT.
 HE MUST BE LOVING IT.
 SO NUMBER TWO, WE GOT KILLER
 CAM.
 CAM NEWTON RIGHT HERE.
 LISTEN, CAM NEWTON IS A FREAK OF
 NATURE.
 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE RIGHT HERE,
 LITTLE TRICK.
 BOOM.
 DROP THE HAMMER DOWN ON THE
 DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.
 HOW MANY QUARTERBACKS ARE
 WILLING TO THROW THEIR SHOULDER
 IN ON A DEFENSIVE LINEMAN AND
 KNOCK HIM DOWN TO THE GROUND.
 CAM IS A BIG BOY.
 SO IT REALLY DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
 THAT HE'S KNOCKED THAT DEFENSIVE
 LINEMAN ON HIS BUTT.
 AGAIN, OFFENSIVE LINEMAN CAN
 APPRECIATE A QUARTERBACK.
 ONE THAT'S BODYING FOR THE PLAY.
 HE'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSING.
 WHEN YOU SEE HIM COME OUT FROM
 WARMUPS, HE'S A PHYSICALLY
 IMPOSING PLAYER THAT HAPPENS TO
 BE A QUARTERBACK.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 QUARTERBACK SEGMENT WITHOUT
 YOU TALKING ABOUT BLOCKING.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 GOT TO HAVE --
 THIS GUY.
 THIS RIGHT HERE, HALL OF
 FAMER RIGHT HERE, PATRICK
 MAHOMES.
 WE TALK ABOUT HIM AS A -AS A
 FATHER, YOU TALK ABOUT HAVING
 YOUR KIDS INVOLVED IN MORE THAN
 ONE SPORT.
 HERE'S WHY.
 YOU TAKE A GUY IN PATRICK
 MAHOMES, GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER,
 ALSO A GREAT BASEBALL PLAYER.
 YOU SEE HIM THROWING FROM ALL
 DIFFERENT ARM ANGLES, BEING ABLE
 TO MAKE PLAYS.
 THROWING WITH HIS LEFT HAND.
 HE DID THIS TIME AFTER TIME
 AGAIN DURING THE SEASON.
 THAT MADE HIM SPECIAL.
 NO-LOOK PASSES.
 TO ME, THAT'S A PART OF A PLAN.
 MULTIPLE SPORTS, THEY KIND OF
 INTERTWINE WITH EACH OTHER.
 THERE'S A BIG REASON WHY HE WAS
 NFL MVP LAST YEAR.
 MIKE, WHEN YOU'RE EVALUATING
 QUARTERBACKS, HOW MUCH DOES IT
 FACTOR IN HOW ATHLETIC THEY ARE
 AND THEY CAN DO THIS STUFF?
 BEING ABLE TO BUY A SECOND
 CHANCE, WE TALKED ABOUT KYLER
 MURRAY BEHIND THE OFFENSIVE
 LINE, THE FACT THAT HE'LL BE
 ABLE TO AVOID, MOVE UP IN THE
 POCKET, SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT
 YARDS, BUT AVOIDING THE BIG HIT,
 EXTENDING THE PLAY.
 KEEPING YOUR EYES DOWN THE
 FIELD.
 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
 IT'S A SKILL THAT TRANSFERS FROM
 COLLEGE TO PROS.
 YOU GUYS -TRIVIA TIME.
 DO YOU KNOW WHICH ACTIVE NFL
 QUARTERBACK HAS THE MOST CAREER
 CATCHES?
 THEY DON'T KNOW.
 NO.
 DREW BREES.
 HE HAS EIGHT.
 WOW.
 HOW ABOUT THAT.
 REALLY?
 WE'LL RUN THEM BACK.
 WE'LL HAVE TO SEE THAT.
 LATER IN THE SUMMER, WE'LL DO
 DREW BREES HIGHLIGHTS.
 WE NEED THE CONTENT.
 JALEN RAMSEY HAS NOT BEEN SHY
 ABOUT SHARING HIS OPINION ON
 THINGS LIKE QUARTERBACK
 RANKINGS.
 NOW HE'S GOT A SUPER BOWL MVP
 LEADING HIS OFFENSE.
 DOES JALEN THINK
       Remember that degree       you got in taxation?
       Of course you don't       because you didn't!
    Your job isn't    understanding tax code...
  it's understanding why that...
 will get him a body like that...
              MOVE!
             ...that.
        Your job isn't        doing hard work...
              Here.
       ...it's making       her do hard work...
   ...and getting paid for it.

 IF YOU DREAM ABOUT CATCHING THIS BALL ON ME, YOU BETTER WAKE
 UP AND APOLOGIZE.
 I GO OUT WITH A LITTLE SWAG.
 PUKD OFF BY JALEN RAMSEY.
 RAMSEY CAME OVER THE TOP.
 YOU GO OUT THERE AND I LET
 THE RECEIVER KNOW EVERY PLAY,
 HEY, THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG
 GAME FOR YOU.
 I CALL THE OUT THEIR ROUTES TO
 LET THEM KNOW.
 YOU'RE TRASH.
 PLEASE, WELCOME INTO "NFL
 LIVE."
 JAGUARS QUARTERBACK JALEN RAMSEY
 WHO JOINS US TODAY FROM LONDON,
 ENGLAND.
 JALEN, I GOT TO START HERE.
 I WAS DISMAYED WHEN YOU SAID YOU
 WERE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE
 BUSINESS OF EVALUATING
 QUARTERBACKS.
 YOU WERE SO GOOD AT IT.
 WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO STOP?
 REALLY, I WENT THROUGH MOST
 OF THEM LAST YEAR.
 TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T THINK I
 NEEDED TO DO IT AGAIN.
 MY OPINIONS DIDN'T SAY TOO MUCH.
 SO YEAH.
 I JUST DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED TO
 DO IT AGAIN.
 I WANTED TO PUMP UP NICK A
 LITTLE BIT.
 I WAS EXCITED TO SEE NICK OUT
 THERE.
 I WANTED TO PUMP NICK UP A
 LITTLE BIT.
 YEAH, GOT AWAY FROM IT FOR A
 LITTLE BIT.
 I'LL STILL TALK MY TRASH,
 THOUGH.
 AS YOU WENT AROUND THE
 LEAGUE, DID YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT
 THAT INTERVIEW YOU GAVE WHERE
 YOU TALKED ABOUT ALL THE
 QUARTERBACKS, PEOPLE GIVE YOU A
 HARD TIME OR TELL YOU YOU WERE
 RIGHT?
 YEAH.
 I MEAN, IT WAS OPINION-BASED.
 YOU KNOW, WE WERE EXACTLY HOW IT
 WENT.
 WE WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT.
 WE STARTED OFF NAMING LIKE WHO
 WERE THE TOP FIVE QUARTERBACKS
 AND GOING DOWN THE LIST.
 I WAS KIND OF STILL KEEPING THE
 TIME FRAME, HE'S NOT TOP FIVE.
 HE'S OVERRATED.
 HE'S GOOD, WHATEVER.
 WHATEVER I WAS SAYING ABOUT EACH
 AND EVERY QUARTERBACK, YEAH,
 GIVING SOME OPINIONS.
 SOME PEOPLE, OF COURSE, YOU
 KNOW, THEY'RE GOING TO AGREE AND
 SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO
 AGREE.
 EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO THEIR
 OWN OPINION.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 YOU MENTIONED YOUR NEW
 QUARTERBACK, NICK FOLES JOINING
 THE JAGUARS AS A FREE AGENT THIS
 YEAR.
 WHAT'S THE ONE THING ABOUT HIM
 THAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU THAT YOU
 MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN BEFORE HE WAS
 YOUR TEAMMATE?
 I MEAN, HE'S JUST -HOW WELL
 HE PRACTICES, I GUESS.
 I OF COURSE, NEVER PRACTICED
 WITH HIM.
 AT MINI-CAMP I SAW HOW HE COMES
 OUT AND WORKS HARD AND PUSHES
 THE GUYS AND LEADS THE OFFENSE.
 IT WAS TRULY IMPRESSIVE.
 I HAD KNOWN AND HEARD ABOUT HOW
 GOOD OF A TEAMMATE HE WAS AND
 HOW GOOD OF A PERSON HE WAS IN
 GENERAL.
 BUT JUST SEEING HIM IN THE
 LOCKER ROOM, BEING IN HIS
 PRESENCE AND COMMUNICATING WITH
 HIM AND OUR FEW INTERACTIONS, IT
 WAS SUPER NICE.
 STARTING QUARTERBACK IS
 OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR CHANGE ON ANY
 NFL TEAM.
 WHAT'S THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN
 THE JAGUARS THIS YEAR VERSUS
 LAST YEAR HAVING MADE THAT
 CHANGE?
 I FEEL LIKE IT'S UPGRADE.
 OF COURSE, I WAS SAYING -BLAKE
 WAS A REALLY GOOD TEAMMATE TO
 EVERYBODY.
 HAVING NICK AND A FORMER SUPER
 BOWL CHAMPION AND SUPER BOWL
 MVP, WE HAVE SUPREME CONFIDENCE
 IN HIM AND WE THINK THAT HE'S
 GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB OF
 LEADING OUR OFFENSE.
 OF COURSE ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE
 OF THE BALL, WE ARE OVERFLOWING
 WITH CONFIDENCE OVER THERE AND
 SAYING WHO WE THINK CAN GET THE
 JOB DONE OVER THERE ON THAT
 SIDE.
 NOW WE GOT SOMEBODY ELSE TO ROLL
 WITH THE OTHER GUYS OVER THERE.
 WE'RE SUPER EXCITED.
 THE DEFENSE OBVIOUSLY
 COMPLETELY DOMINANT TWO SEASONS
 AGO.
 YOU KWAME AGONIZINGLY CLOSE TO
 THE SUPER BOWL AND LAST YEAR,
 DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE TEAM ALL
 THE WAY AROUND.
 WHAT GIVES YOU THE CONFIDENCE
 THAT THIS CAN BE CLOSER TO 2017
 THAN 2018?
 WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THE
 JOURNEY TO BE HONEST.
 YOU KNOW, JOURNEY PEOPLE SAY
 TRUST THE PROCESS AND STUFF LIKE
 THAT.
 I REALLY DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IN
 THAT.
 WE CAN MAKE HOWEVER MANY PLANS
 WE WANT TO IN OUR HEADS AND
 WHATEVER WE FEEL THE PROCESS IS.
 IT'S TRULY GOING TO BE A
 JOURNEY.
 IT'S GOING TO BE UPS AND DOWNS,
 HIGHS AND LOWS.
 WE HAVE TO ROLL WITH ALL OF
 THEM.
 WE HAVE TO ROLL WITH THE HIGHS
 AND THE LOWS.
 WE HAVE TO PUSH THROUGH AND MAKE
 SURE THAT WE ARE IN POSITION TO
 WIN THE DIVISION, WIN THE
 CONFERENCE AND GO TO THE SUPER
 BOWL AND COMPETE FOR THE SUPER
 BOWL.
 YOU'VE QUICKLY ESTABLISHED
 YOURSELF AS ONE OF THE BETTER
 PLAYERS AT YOUR POSITION IN THE
 LEAGUE.
 BUT THE NFL BEING WHAT IT IS,
 YOU'RE STILL A WAYS AWAY FROM
 FREE AGENCY.
 THE JAGUARS PICKED UP YOUR
 CONTRACT OPTION FOR 2020.
 ANY EXTENSION TALKS YET OR IS
 THAT STILL ON THE BACK BURNER?
 IT'S ON THE BACK BURNER RIGHT
 NOW.
 BUT THAT'S COMPLETELY FINE.
 FIRST ROUND CONTRACTS OUR
 STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW.
 THE TEAMS HAVE A LOT OF
 LEVERAGE.
 THEY CAN PICK UP THE FIFTH-YEAR
 OPTION.
 YOU KNOW, UNLIKE OTHER GUYS WHO
 OUT-PLAY THEIR ROOKIE CONTRACT
 AND CAN REUP RIGHT NOW AND GET
 BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE WORTH,
 FIRST ROUNDERS DON'T HAVE THAT
 LUXURY.
 WE HAVE THE FIFTH YEAR OPTION
 AND AFTER THAT THEY CAN
 FRANCHISE TAG AND DO EVERY THING
 THEY WANT TO DO.
 THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
 LEVERAGE.
 I'M GOING TO LET MY AGENT HANDLE
 A LOT OF THAT.
 I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON WHAT I CAN
 FOCUS ON AND PLAY BALL.
 HELP THE TEAM WIN WHILE I'M HERE
 IN JACKSONVILLE.
 HOPEFULLY, I'M HERE FOR A LONG
 TIME.
 IT'S TIME TO OPEN UP CONTRACT
 NEGOTIATIONS.
 WE'LL SEE HOW THINGS GO.
 OF COURSE, WE WANTED TO GET IT
 DONE THIS YEAR.
 BUT IT WON'T GET DONE THIS YEAR.
 HEY, IT IS WHAT IT IS.
 WE TALKED WITH THE JAGUARS AND
 EVERYBODY WHO IS IN CHARGE OF
 THAT.
 THEY KNOW WHAT'S UP.
 THEY KNOW --
 YOU'RE COMING TO US FROM
 LONDON TODAY.
 A BIG STORY IN THE STATES IS THE
 U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM BEATING
 ENGLAND IN THE WORLD CUP
 YESTERDAY.
 WHAT'S CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF A
 LOT OF PEOPLE IS ALEX MORGAN --
 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT AS
 A KNOWN TRASH TALKER?
 I LOVED IT, OF COURSE.
 LIKE YOU SAID, I'VE BEEN KNOWN
 TO TRASH TALK MYSELF AND DO EYE
 A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.
 I LOVED IT.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FITTING,
 OF COURSE.
 BECAUSE OF WHO THEY PLAYED,
 OBVIOUSLY.
 I MEAN, SERVING IT UP, WHY NOT?
 HAVE SOME FUN.
 YOU KNOW, WE'RE PROFESSIONAL
 ATHLETES, OF COURSE, BUT WE'RE
 ALSO ENTERTAINERS IN A SENSE.
 WE WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING
 INTERESTING.
 SO NOW, SHE GAVE PEOPLE
 EVERYTHING TO TALK ABOUT, A LOT
 TO TALK ABOUT.
 I THINK IT'S COOL.
 I THINK IT'S GOOD.
 JALEN RAMSEY, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH FOR JOINING US ON "NFL
 LIVE" AND SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS.
 BEST OF LUCK TO YOU IN COMING
 SEASON.
 APPRECIATE IT.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 ALL RIGHT.
 BACK TO OUR DECLARATIONS.
 IF YOU WEREN'T HERE EARLIER,
 TOMORROW IS THE FOURTH OF JULY
 AND THE DECLARATION OF
 INDEPENDENCE.
 NFL DECLARATIONS HERE ON "NFL
 LIVE."
 DAMIAN MADE A DECLARATION
 EARLIER ABOUT KIRK COUSINS.
 HE WAS VERY VOCIFEROUS.
 MIKE, YOU GOT ONE ON THE
 JAGUARS?
 I ABSOLUTELY DO.
 I DECLARE THAT NICK FOLES WILL
 LEAD THE JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS TO
 THE SUPER BOWL REPRESENTING THE
 AFC.
 I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS
 BECAUSE YOU'RE A STUDENT OF THE
 GAME.
 LAST YEAR THE JAGUARS AVERAGED
 LESS THAN 10 POINTS A GAME AND
 YOU TAKE WHAT IS ALREADY A
 CHAMPIONSHIP LEVEL DEFENSE LED
 BY JALEN RAMSEY AND THIS YEAR'S
 FIRST ROUND PICK, JOSH ALLEN,
 WITH A QUARTERBACK WHO TWO YEARS
 AGO, BUT FOR A DROP IN THE NFC
 PLAYOFFS, BROUGHT THE EAGLES TO
 TWO CONSECUTIVE SUPER BOWLS.
 THAT'S MY DECLARATION.
 THIS IS INTERESTING.
 JALEN RAMSEY HAS, IN FACT,
 STAYED ON THE LINE AND HEARD
 YOUR DK DECLARATION, MIKE
 TANNENBAUM.
 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON
 THAT?
 I LOVE THAT DECLARATION RIGHT
 THERE.
 SPEAKING OF -I LOVE IT.
 I'M SUPER EXCITED TO HAVE NICK
 ON THE TEAM.
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT ALL THAT
 CONFIDENCE BEHIND HIM AND LET
 HIM LEAD THE OFFENSE.
 LIKE YOU SAID, THIS DEFENSE WE
 HAVE, WE THINK SOME BIG THINGS
 COULD BE IN STORE FOR THE 2019
 SEASON.
 JALEN WHEN EVERYBODY IS ON
 THE BANDWAGON, REMEMBER WE HAD
 THIS CONVERSATION ON JULY 3rd.
 THAT WAS MY DECLARATION.
 I'M WITH YOU GUYS.
 THE BANDWAGON STARTS TODAY.
 LET NOT LET ANYBODY ELSE ON.
 I APPRECIATE YOU STICKING
 AROUND.
 LOVE IT.
 DECLARATION -WE SHOULD HAVE
 JALEN IN AND DO THE --
 YOU JUST GO ALL IN.
 GO ALL IN ON MY HEAD ABOUT KIRK
 COUSINS.
 YOU'RE ALL IN ON JACKSONVILLE.
 LISTEN, NICK FOLES WAS GREAT
 WITH DOUG PEDERSON.
 I FELT THEY HAD A CHEMISTRY.
 YOU THINK THEY CAN CREATE THAT
 IN JACKSONVILLE WITH THIS
 DIFFERENT CAST OF CHARACTERS?
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
 IT STARTS WITH THE OFFENSIVE
 LINE.
 THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD OFFENSIVE
 LINE.
 DOUG MARRONE WAS AN OFFENSIVE
 LINEMAN, PLAYED, COACHED IT.
 NOW HE'S THEIR HEAD COACH.
 IT ALLOWS THEM TO TRAVEL, PLAY
 WELL ON THE ROAD AND WITH THAT
 DEFENSE, THEY'RE LOADED UP
 FRONT.
 THEY HAVE A LOT OF DEPTH AT PASS
 RUSHER WHEN YOU LOOK AT LAST
 YEAR'S FIRST ROUND PICK.
 NOKE WAY.
 AT DEFENSIVE END AND CALAIS
 CAMPBELL AND JOSH ALLEN THIS
 YEAR.
 THEY HAVE DEPTH UP FRONT AND TWO
 CORNERS IN RAMSEY.
 BLAKE BORTLES.
 WE'RE BEING GENEROUS WITH THAT.
 NICK FOLES WAS A GOOD
 QUARTERBACK.
 THAT'S MY DECLARATION.
 ONE DIFFERENCE, MIGHT BE THE
 REASON THEY SIGN THEM, 23
 INTERCEPTIONS IN 40 GAMES IN
 PHILADELPHIA.
 BORTLES HAD 58 INTERCEPTIONS IN
 60 GAMES.
 THEY SHOULD BE BETTER THERE.
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE
 DECLARATIONS LATER IN THE SHOW.
 WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO SOCCER.
 ALEX MORGAN SHOOK UP THE TWITTER
 VERSE WITH HER TEA SIPPING --
 WHAT COMPARES TO THIS
 SURPRISINGLY CONTROVERSIAL ONE.
 STAY TUNED TO "NFL LIVE."
 WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.
  Why use Post-it Extreme Notes?
  Because they make your message  stick,
 getting it said, and done right, the first time.
         Aw, C'mon!
  Stop the Re-work with Post-it  Extreme Notes.
 Hiyeeeeeee!
                      Hiyeeeeeee!
                Oh!
        We all just got new      smartphones at Cricket!
            Hiyeeeeeee!

                      !Holaaaaa!
 Hiyeeeeeee!
                      Hiyeeeeeee!
          OK, biyeeeeee!
    Is Bud Light Orange coming        back this summer?            Biyeeeee!!
        And never leaving?
       And brewed with real          orange peels?
       The answer is yes...
             ...yes...
             and yes.

          In every trip,      there's room for more
 p,          and yes.      than just the business      theryou came for.more

    Whether that's keeping up    with what you always do...

    you've never done before.

           That's room         for possibility.
    you've never done before.
           That's room         for possibility.
           That's room         for possibility.



 WITH THE FIRST PICK, THE NEW ORLEANS PELICANS SELECT DIE ON
 WILLIAMSON.
 THE KNICKS SELECT R.J. BARRY.
 I LOVE --
 MY DREAM CAME TRUE.
 NBA SUMMER LEAGUE ACTION
 FRIDAY.
 WE'VE GOT A TRIPLE HEADER
 STARTING AT 7:30 EASTERN.
 YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS THE
 SPECIAL MATCHUP AT 9:30 EASTERN
 TIME FEATURING WILLIAMSON AND
 BARRETT FACING OFF FOR THE FIRST
 TIME AS PROS.
 SPEAKING OF THE NBA, LAKERS FAN
 DAMIAN WOODY INSISTS THAT WE
 TALK ABOUT THE KAWHI LEONARD
 FREE AGENCY SITUATION.
 STILL WAITING FOR WORD ON WHERE
 HE'LL END UP.
 IF IT IS THE LAKERS, DAMIAN IS
 EXCITED TO SEE THAT PICTURE
 THERE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 AN IMPOSING BIG THREE WITH
 LeBRON JAMES AND ANTHONY DAVIS.
 SO SAY THIS ABOUT 20 TIMES
 TODAY, THAT GOT US THINKING
 ABOUT NFL BIG THREES AND WE'RE
 LOOKING AT SOME PRETTY GOOD ONES
 RIGHT HERE.
 MIKE TANNENBAUM, WHY DON'T YOU
 RANK THEM FOR US.
 NUMBER 5 TO 1.
 NUMBER 5, THE L.A. RAMS.
 STAYING IN L.A.
 COME ON OVER.
 THERE YOU GO.
 THERE WE GO.
 THE REASON THEY'RE ONLY FIVE.
 I LIKE COOKS, I DON'T SEE HIM AS
 AN ELITE RECEIVER, HE'S STRAIGHT
 LINE AND FAST.
 NOT GREAT CHANGE OF DIRECTION.
 THAT'S WHY THEY'RE FIVE FOR ME.
 GOT THEM TO THE SUPER BOWL.
 NUMBER 4, THE ATLANTA
 FALCONS.
 YOU LOOK AT MATT RYAN, SUPER
 BOWL QUARTERBACK, JULIO JONES,
 ARGUABLY THE BEST RECEIVER IN
 THE NFL AND THEN OBVIOUSLY
 FREEMAN OFF THE INJURY.
 HE'S A GOOD RUNNING BACK.
 I THINK THAT'S A REALLY SOLID
 THREE GUYS RIGHT THERE.
 RUNNING BACKS COMING OFF
 INJURIES.
 THEY CAN REST ON THOSE TOO TWO
 GUYS.
 DRAFTED A COUPLE LINEMEN UP
 FRONT.
 THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR
 MATT RYAN AND DeVONTE FREEMAN.
 BIG THREE OFFENSIVE LINE.
 NUMBER 3, THE DALLAS
 COWBOYS.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE
 THIS.
 DAK PRESCOTT, 32-16 AS A
 STARTING.
 ZEKE ELLIOTT A RUNNING BACK AS
 THERE IS IN THE LEAGUE, AMARI
 COOPER, ALL THEY DID WAS GO 7-2
 AFTER THE TRADE AND THEY WERE
 NUMBER ONE OVER THE LAST NINE
 GAMES ON THIRD DOWN.
 NUMBER 2, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
 THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS LED BY
 FUTURE HALL OF FAMER DREW BREES
 AT QUARTERBACK.
 MICHAEL THOMAS WHO IS NOT BAD.
 JULIO JONES NOT FAR BEHIND.
 WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM, HE'S A
 GREAT RUNNING BACK AND OUT OF
 THE BACKFIELD.
 WHO COULD BE BETTER THAN
 THAT?
 LET'S -ONE OF YOUR FORMER
 TEAMS.
 THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS,
 SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN TO THE --
 TOM BRADY, BEST QUARTERBACK OF
 ALL-TIME, JULIAN EDELMAN, I HAVE
 SO MUCH RESPECT AND ADMIRATION
 FROM HIM.
 HE'S WILLED HIMSELF INTO A GREAT
 PLAYER.
 SONY MICHEL ISN'T A GREAT
 PLAYER -HE WAS A FIRST ROUND
 PICK.
 GOT BETTER AS THE YEAR WENT ON.
 HE'S GOING TO TURN INTO BEING A
 GOOD NFL RUNNING BACK.
 TOM BRADY, IT STARTS WITH HIM.
 YOU KNOW, I AM DISAPPOINTED
 IN YOU RIGHT NOW.
 YOU KNOW WHY?
 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T
 BELIEVE IN KIRK COUSINS.
 THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST DUO IN
 THE LEAGUE IN ADAM AND STEPHAN
 DIGS.
 WHAT IS UP WITH THE HATE AGAINST
 THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS?
 YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN TO THE
 PURPLE PEOPLE EATERS OUT THERE.
 I WATCHED THE TAPE, THAT'S I
 CAN'T.
 WHOA.
 THAT IS A GOOD GROUP.
 IT'S NOT LIKE -OBVIOUSLY
 KANSAS CITY.
 THESE ARE ALL GOOD.
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HALL OF
 FAME QUARTERBACK, TOM BRADY.
 HALL OF FAME QUARTERBACK IN DREW
 BREES.
 MATT RYAN HAS A HALL OF FAME
 CREDENTIALS POSSIBLY AND I THINK
 THAT'S A REALLY HIGH LEVEL.
 NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF OVER
 HERE.
 DO YOU THINK THAT IF DALVIN
 COOK IS A HEALTHY RUNNING BACK,
 HE COULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT
 THEM IN THIS CATEGORY.
 I THINK DALVIN COOK IS A GAME
 CHANGER.
 KIRK COUSINS IS A GOOD RUNNING
 GAME.
 PLAY ACTION.
 DALVIN COOK HOPEFULLY NOT ONLY
 HELPS THE RUNNING GAME BUT THEIR
 PASSING GAME.
 THOSE ARE THE BIG THREES.
 STILL NOTHING ON KAWHI.
 WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF WE SEE
 ANYTHING.
 WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO TIGHTI
 HAD NJOKU ABOUT ALL

         New for summer.
         Here for summer.
     Arriving...this summer.
    It's Bud Light Lemon Tea.
         New for summer.


 I've been waiting my whole life            for this.

            You ready?
             Are you?

               Woo.

        Look! Make a wish!
       I wish for a Biggie       Bag from Wendy's.
    I wish everyone loved each    other and was always...
   That's a great wish, Jimmy.
  Get a Bacon Double stack with  a quarter pound of fresh beef,
   nuggets, fries and a   drink for just five bucks.
  Wendy's Biggie Bag is  everything you could wish for.
 BREAKING NEWS INTO "NFNFL LIVE."
 COWBOYS RUNNING BABACK, EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT HAS BEEN INFORMED HE
 WILL NOT BE SUSPENDED FOR HIS
 ROLE IN THAT RECENT ALTERCATION
 IN LAS VEGAS WITH THE SECURITY
 GUARD THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE
 TOP OF THE SHOW.
 ELLIOTT MET WITH COMMISSIONER
 ROGER GOODELL YESTERDAY AND
 ISSUED A STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
 ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT THERE,
 APOLOGIZING AND WE ARE NOW BEING
 INFORMED THAT HE WILL NOT FACE
 ANOTHER SUSPENSION.
 SO OBVIOUSLY A RELIEF FOR
 EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND FOR THE
 COWBOYS THERE.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 LISTEN, AS A VETERAN IN THE
 LOCKER ROOM, THIS IS EXACTLY THE
 OUTCOME YOU WANTED.
 YOU WANT ALL YOUR GUYS, ALL
 HANDS ON DECK TO BE AVAILABLE.
 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT YEAR FOR
 EVERYONE WITHIN THE DALLAS
 COWBOYS ORGANIZATION FROM THE
 HEAD COACH ON DOWN.
 OBVIOUSLY, MAYBE THE MOST
 IMPORTANT PLAYER FOR THE TEAM IS
 GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AT THE
 START OF THE SEASON.
 ARE YOU SURPRISED, MIKE?
 I WAS MILDLY SURPRISED.
 AGAIN, THE PERSONAL CONDUCT

 POLICY'S STANDARD IS LOWER THAN
 CRIMINAL CONDUCT.
 THE COMMISSIONER COULD HAVE
 SUSPENDED HIM BECAUSE HE'S A
 REPEAT OFFENDER AND THE FACT
 THAT HE BROUGHT HIM TO NEW YORK
 CITY SHOWS IT WAS SIGNIFICANT
 ENOUGH FOR A FACE-TO-FACE
 MEETING.
 LOOK, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
 HOPEFULLY EZEKIEL ELLIOTT HAS
 LEARNED AND ALL THESE SORT OF
 BUMPS IN THE ROAD FROM OFF THE
 FIELD ARE IN HIS PAST BECAUSE HE
 IS A GREAT PLAYER AND BY ALL
 ACCOUNTS A GOOD TEAMMATE AS
 WELL.
 HOPEFULLY HE'S LEARNED FROM THIS
 AND MOVED ON.
 WE TALKED EARLIER IN THE SHOW
 ABOUT THE KIND OF CONVERSATION
 YOU HAVE WITH A PLAYER IN THIS
 SITUATION IF YOU'RE IN THE FRONT
 OFFICE.
 DOES THE FACT THAT HE ISN'T
 BEING SUSPENDED CHANGE ANY PART
 OF THAT MESSAGE OR MAKE IT MORE
 DIFFICULT TO DELIVER?
 NO.
 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STERN, DIRECT
 AND HARD CONVERSATION THAT YOUR
 BEHAVIOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND
 EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T RISE TO
 THE LEVEL OF SUSPENSION, IT'S
 STILL NOT CONDUCT BECOMING OF A
 DALLAS COWBOY.
 AGAIN, IF I WAS IN THE FRONT
 OFFICE MAKING THE DECISION, I
 WOULD HIT PAUSE ON THE CONTRACT
 EXTENSION AND I WOULD PUT MY
 EFFORTS AND ENERGY INTO THE GOOD
 PLAYERS AND THE PLAYERS THAT
 HAVE HANDLED THEMSELVES THE
 RIGHT WAY OFF THE FIELD STARTING
 WITH THE QUARTERBACK, DAK
 PRESCOTT AND THEIR RECEIVER,
 AMARI COOPER.
 HOPEFULLY, IT'S A LESSON LEARNED
 FOR ZEKE ELLIOTT, IT DOESN'T
 HAPPEN AGAIN.
 IF I'M THE DALLAS COWBOYS, I
 HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION
 WITH HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT WE'RE
 THINKING AND WHY WE'RE THINKING
 IT.
 DAMIAN?
 AGAIN, AS A PLAYER IN THE
 LOCKER ROOM, THIS IS WHAT YOU
 WANT TO HEAR.
 HE'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AND
 WE CAN GO OUT AND WIN FOOTBALL
 GAMES.
 I MEAN, IS THERE ANYTHING TO
 THE IDEA HE'S NOT BEING SPEBDED
 SO YOU STILL HAVE TO SORT OF
 MAKE SURE SOMETHING IT LEARNED
 FROM THIS, RIGHT, AS A PLAYER?
 THERE'S SOMETHING FOR THE
 DALLAS COWBOYS INTERNALLY FOR
 THE ORGANIZATION THEY WANT TO
 DO.
 FOR A VETERAN, DON'T MESS WITH
 MY MONEY.
 THAT'S MY BIGGEST THING.
 WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE, YOU
 AFFECT MY PLAY.
 SO STAY ON THE STRAIGHT AND
 NARROW SO WE CAN WIN FOOTBALL
 GAMES.
 NOT THIS NECESSARILY HAPPENED
 TO YOU, BUT BEING CALLED INTO
 THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE EVEN
 WITH NO SUSPENSION, SHOULD
 THAT --
 IT SHOULD BE.
 SCARED STRAIGHT.
 YOU GOT TO TALK TO BIG BAD ROGER
 GOODELL, MAKE SURE I'M ON THE
 STRAIGHT AND NARROW.
 HOPEFULLY EZEKIEL HAS LEARNED
 FROM THIS AND THE COWBOYS CAN
 MOVE FORWARD NOW.
 THAT'S THE PART THAT THERE'S
 A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE NFL
 COMMUNITY THAT ARE SURPRISED.
 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS
 AGO, THE LAST TIME, GOT

 SUSPENDED, HAD TO GO TO THE
 LEAGUE OFFICE.
 YOU WOULD THINK WITH THE
 CONTRACT ON THE HORIZON, HE
 WOULD TRY TO BE IMPECCABLE.
 HOPEFULLY HE'S LEARNED FROM IT
 AND CAN MOVE ON.
 OBVIOUSLY, THIS CLEARS THE
 DECK IN TERMS OF A MAJOR
 CONCERN.
 THEY HAVE CONTRACT SITUATION
 TOSS WORK THROUGH HEADING INTO
 CAMP.
 YOU SEE THEM PRIEPD FOR A REAL
 SERIES RUN?
 I THINK THE DALLAS COWBOYS
 CAN REPRESENT IN THE SUPER BOWL.
 THE WAY THAT DAK PRESCOTT PLAYED
 AFTER THE TRADE OF AMARI COOPER
 FROM OAKLAND, THE NUMBERS SPEAK
 FOR THEMSELVES.
 ACROSS THE BOARD.
 COMPLETION PERCENTAGE, YARDS PER
 ATTEMPT.
 THIRD DOWN.
 ALL THOSE NUMBERS WERE
 SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER WITH AMARI
 COOPER.
 YOU KNOW, DURING THE TRADE,
 DURING THE SEASON, SO IMAGINE
 NOW IN THE OFF-SEASON, YOU GOT A
 NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN
 KELLEN MOORE.
 WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING
 TO WORK OUT, BUT YOU WOULD THINK
 IT WOULD ACCENTUATE ALL PARTS OF
 DAK'S GAME.
 THIS OFFENSE, THIS TEAM IN
 GENERAL TO ME IS ONE OF THE
 BETTER TEAMS IN THE NATIONAL
 FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
 ONLY THREE TEAMS IN THE
 LEAGUE WON MORE GAMES THAN THE
 COWBOYS THE LAST THREE YEARS.
 THE CHIEFS, THE PATRIOTS AND THE
 STEELERS.
 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD COMPANY.
 AGAIN, I DON'T THINK DAK
 PRESCOTT GETS ENOUGH CREDIT.
 HE'S 32-16 AS A STARTER.
 THE ULTIMATE MEASURE OF A
 QUARTERBACK IS HIS ONE LOSS
 RECORD.
 YOU GO BACK TO THE LAST YEAR,
 PASSER RATING OF 122 ON PLAY
 ACTION PLAYS.
 IT SHOWS YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF
 EZEKIEL ELLIOTT'S AVAILABILITY
 AS YOU MENTIONED, DAMIAN.
 DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH OF
 CARSON WENTZ, DALLAS HAS A
 REASONABLE CHANCE OF WINNING
 THIS DIVISION.
 OVERS LAST COUPLE YEARS,
 PHILADELPHIA HAS DONE A GOOD JOB
 OF HAVING BEEN BEHIND WENTZ.
 FOLES ISN'T THERE.
 WENTZ HAS TO OVERKONL THAT
 ISSUE.
 CAN HE STAY HEALTHY FOR 16
 GAMES.
 YOU LOOK AT THE WAY DALLAS HAS
 BUILT ITS TEAM ON BOTH SIDES OF
 THE BALL.
 THE NFL RELEASED A STATEMENT
 ON THIS ISSUE REGARDING EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT.
 ANNOUNCING THAT HE WON'T BE
 SUSPENDED.
 IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REPORTS OF
 AN INCIDENT IN LAS VEGAS IN MAY,
 THE NFL CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE
 INVESTIGATION THAT INCLUDED
 INTERVIEWS WITH MULTIPLE
 WITNESSES, INCLUDING SECURITY
 PERSONNEL AND OTHERS WITH DIRECT
 INVOLVEMENT.
 AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF
 DOCUMENTARY AND OTHER
 INFORMATION.
 ON TUESDAY, AS PART OF THE
 REVIEW, NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER
 GOODELL MET WITH MR. ELLIOTT TO
 REINFORCE THE STANDARDS OF
 CONDUCT EXPECTED OF HIM AND THE
 CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO MEET
 THOSE STANDARDS.
 MR. ELLIOTT ACKNOWLEDGED HE
 DEMONSTRATED POOR JUDGMENT AND
 COMMITTED TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES
 IN THE FUTURE.
 HE VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
 OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO
 HIM TO HELP HIM TO GROW
 PERSONALLY.
 COMMISSIONER GOODELL DETERMINED
 THERE WAS NO VIOLATION OF THE
 PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY AND NO
 FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED.
 SO STATEMENT CONFIRMING WHAT WE
 WERE TOLD.
 ANY QUICK REACTIONS THERE?
 GOT LUCKY.
 HE GOT LUCKY.
 HE COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN
 SUSPENDED AGAIN.
 MIKE, YOU HAD TOUCHED UPON IT
 PRIOR.
 USUALLY IN THESE SITUATIONS, YOU
 KNOW, THIS IS YOUR SECOND TIME
 GOING TO NEW YORK AND TALKING TO
 THE COMMISSIONER.
 YOU'VE BEEN SUSPENDED BEFORE
 ALREADY.
 YOU GET OFF WITH NO PUNISHMENT.
 HE'S VERY FORTUNATE TO BE IN
 THIS SITUATION.
 THEY TOUCHED ON IT IN A
 LETTER THERE THAT LEAGUE AND THE
 UNION DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT,
 THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO
 PLAYERS, TO COACHES, TO STAFF IN
 TERMS OF, IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
 NEED HELP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
 RESOURCES BEHIND THE SCENES.
 HOPEFULLY IF HE NEEDS THAT, HE
 TAKES ADVANTAGE OF IT AND I KNOW
 THEY MENTIONED THAT IN A LETTER.
 THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF
 THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
 AGREEMENT.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO HELP PLAYERS.
 ONCE AGAIN, THE NEWS ON
 COWBOYS RUNNING BACK, EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT, NO PUNISHMENT, NO
 SUSPENSION AS A RESULT OF HIS
 MOST RECENT INCIDENT.
 WHEN WE RETURN, ALEX MORGAN
 WOKE UP SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER
 CASUALLY SIPPING HER TEA
 TUESDAY.
 WE'LL SHOW YOU SOME NFL
 CELEBRATIONS THAT ALEX REMINDED
 US OF.
 THEY WANT A SHOW.
 THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET ONE.
 GOT YOUR POPCORN READY.
 GET YOUR POPCORN READY.
 THAT'S ALL FOLKS.
      It's Rukmini here from       The New York Times .
        Hey, you see this?
      THIS IS A PAYDAY BAR.
    AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING    YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
  IT HAS A TRUCK LOAD OF PEANUTS  SURROUNDING SWEET CARAMEL.
          I MEAN HOLY...
    LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEANUTS.
    BEST PART IS IT HELPS    YOU GET THROUGH YOUR DAY.
             PAYDAY.
    BEST PART IS IT HELPS    YOU GET THROUGH YOUR DAY.
      You can tell from     the airborne citrus
   that Bud Light Lime, Orange          and Lemon Tea
    are brewed with real lime,
     orange and lemon peels.
      Well, maybe you can't,
          but there are some         firm context clues.
          In every trip,      there's room for more
          In every trip,      there's room for more
      than just the business          you came for.

     Whether that's taking in          every moment,
      or capturing a moment       worth bringing back.
      or capturing a moment       worth bringing back.
   That's room for possibility.


      Feed your imagination.      Feed your excitement.
       Feed...your hunger.
     When heroes get hungry,
  they get the $12 Extra Large,         Superhero Pizza
         at Papa John's.
  they get the $12 Extra Large,         Superhero Pizza
            It's open!
               Hey.
         This is amazing.
     With moderate to severe       ulcerative colitis,
          Are you okay?
      even when I was there,
  I never knew when my symptoms
       would keep us apart.
     So I talked to my doctor          about HUMIRA.
  I learned HUMIRA can help get,
    and keep UC under control
  when other medications haven't       worked well enough.
   And it helps people achieve       control that lasts.
    So you can experience few
         or no symptoms.
  <i> HUMIRA can lower your ability</i>       <i> to fight infections,</i>
     <i> including tuberculosis.</i>
     <i> Serious, sometimes fatal</i>     <i> infections and cancers,</i>
     <i> including lymphoma, have</i>            <i> happened;</i>
    <i> as have blood, liver, and</i>     <i> nervous system problems,</i>
 <i>serious allergic reactions, and</i> <i>new or worsening heart failure.</i>
        <i> Before treatment,</i>        <i> get tested for TB.</i>
 <i>Tell your doctor if you've been</i>             <i> to areas</i>
 <i>where certain fungal infections</i>           <i> are common,</i>
      <i> and if you've had TB,</i>
           <i> hepatitis B,</i>
     <i> are prone to infections,</i>
    <i> or have flu-like symptoms</i>            <i> or sores.</i>
  <i> Don't start HUMIRA if you have</i>          <i> an infection.</i>
   Be there for you, and them.
   Ask your gastroenterologist          about HUMIRA.
           With HUMIRA,       control is possible.

 HE WILL NOT FACE A PUNISHMENT
 FOR A RECENT ROLE INVOLVING A
 SECURITY GUARD.
 HE DID NOT VIOLATE THE PERSONAL
 CONDUCT POLICY SO NO SUSPENSION

 THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON ESPN.
 BIG NEWS YESTERDAY IN THE
 OTHER KIND OF FOOTBALL.
 U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM BEATING
 ENGLAND IN THE SEMIFINALS AT THE
 WORLD CUP.
 SINCE THAT TEAM CAN'T SEEM TO DO
 ANYTHING, PART OF THE STORY IS
 ALEX MORGAN'S TEA SIPPING
 CELEBRATION FOLLOWING WHAT
 TURNED OUT TO BE AT GAME WINNING
 GOAL.
 THE CELEBRATION -HOWEVER YOU
 FEEL ABOUTT IT'S GOT US THINKING
 ABOUT SITUATIONS IN THE NFL
 WHERE PEOPLE CELEBRATE AND KIND
 OF TAILOR THEIR CELEBRATIONS A
 LITTLE BIT TO THE OPPONENT.
 WEEK FOUR OF THE YEAR 2000,
 49ers AND COWBOYS, CELEBRATES A
 TOUCHDOWN BY POSING ON THE
 DALLAS STAR.
 WAS THAT A HIT AT THE COWBOYS?
 I COULDN'T TELL.
 I LOVED IT, MAN.
 WEEK TEN, DOLPHINS/PACKERS,
 SACK OF AARON RODGERS.
 KNOCKS HIM WITH THE DISCOUNT
 DOUBLE-CHECK.
 IF YOU'RE GOING TO DITCH
 THEM, YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE
 IT.
 BAKER MAYFIELD, OKLAHOMA,
 COLLEGE FOOTAGE.
 OKLAHOMA, OHIO STATE, DEFEATS
 THE BUCKEYES.
 PLANTS THE OU FLAG IN THE OHIO
 STATE LOGO AT MIDFIELD.
 AGAIN, NOT REAL SUBTLE.
 2011, NFC WILDCARD GAME.
 I WAS THERE.
 FALCONS/GIANTS, AKIM NICKS
 CATCHES A TOUCHDOWN PASS AND
 DOES THE DIRTY BIRD DANCE.
 I THOUGHT HE WAS TOO YOUNG TO
 KNOW THAT.
 DID HIS RESEARCH BEFORE THE
 GAME.
 WEEK 10, PANTHERS/BRONCOS.
 MILLER SACKS CAM NEWTON AND DOES
 HIS SUPERMAN.
 HE PRACTICED THAT.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 DOUBLE STRUT THERE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 T.O. AGAIN.
 WEEK 8, 2004.
 EAGLES/RAVENS, TERRELL OWENS
 CATCHES A TOUCHDOWN PASS AND
 THREE GAME DANCE.
 THAT'S GOOD.
 I LOVE T.O.
 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM
 DO IT, THEN YOU BETTER STOP HIM.
 YOU KNOW HE PRACTICED THAT.
 OF COURSE.
 YOU FRONT OFFICE GUYS IN YOUR
 OFFICE OR WHATEVER, THESE GUYS
 ARE IN THE LOCKER ROOM THINKING
 OF ALL TYPES TO DO ON GAMEDAY.
 I LOVED IT, MAN.
 DID YOU KNOW THEY WERE DOING
 THAT DOWN THERE?
 COME ON.
 DON'T BE A LAME.
 WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE FUN OUT
 HERE.
 THIS IS A SPORT.
 WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE FUN.
 THE NFL HAS ALLOWED
 CELEBRATIONS RECENTLY.
 BUT THEY DON'T LIKE THE DIRECT
 TAUNTING OF OPPONENTS.
 WHERE IS THE LINE?
 LISTEN, FOR ME IT'S
 COMPETITION.
 IT'S COMPETITION FOR ME.
 I KNOW EVERYONE IS GOING TO TALK
 ABOUT SPORTSMANSHIP.
 I'VE BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION,
 IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO
 CELEBRATE AND TALK TRASH, STOP
 THEM.
 STOP THEM.
 PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
 WHEN AT THE CELEBRATE AS A
 TEAM, IT'S GREAT.
 THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THERE'S
 BEEN CREATIVE CELEBRATIONS GOING
 BACK TO THE STEELERS, BENCH
 PRESSING.
 WHEN IT'S THE TEAM, I'M ALL FOR
 IT.
 SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE GENERAL
 MANAGER.

 COWBOYS RUNNING BACK, EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT WILL NOT FACE PUNISHMENT
 FOR HIS ROLE IN A RECENT
 INCIDENT WITH A SECURITY GUARD
 IN LAS VEGAS.
 ELLIOTT MET WITH COMMISSIONER
 ROGER GOODELL FOR A COUPLE OF
 HOURS TUESDAY THIS WEEK AND WAS
 INFORMED HE WOULD NOT BE
 SUSPENDED.
 THE NFL RELEASED A STATEMENT
 EXPLAINING IT, BASICALLY SAYS
 THEY FOUND HE DID NOT VIOLATE
 THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY, BUT
 THEY HOPE THAT HE CONTINUES TO
 STAY OUT OF THESE SITUATIONS IN
 THE FUTURE.
 DAMIAN, YOUR THOUGHTS?
 WELL, I MEAN, MY BIGGEST
 THING IS DOES ZEKE GROW FROM
 HERE?
 THIS IS THE SECOND TIME GOING TO
 NEW YORK.
 THE FIRST TIME, I BELIEVE IT WAS
 A SIX-GAME SUSPENSION.
 THIS TIME HE GOT OFF WITH NO
 SUSPENSION, BUT YOU WOULD THINK
 THAT AT THIS POINT NOW, IT'S
 TIME FOR YOU TO GROW AND MATURE
 AND PUT YOURSELF IN COMPROMISING
 SITUATIONS BECAUSE, AGAIN AS A
 VETERAN, I'M DEPENDENT ON YOU.
 I NEED -GUYS IN THE LOCKER
 ROOM NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.
 I WANT TO SEE MORE GROWTH AND
 MATURITY OUT OF ZEKE ELLIOTT.
 I TOTALLY AGREE.
 YOU TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER
 WITH THE CONTRACT SITUATION IF
 HE'S BEHAVING WITHOUT THAT BIG
 DEAL, $45 MILLION GUARANTEED,
 FROM AN ORGANIZATION STANDPOINT
 WHAT, IS HE GOING TO BE LIKE
 ONCE HE HAS THAT MONEY?
 NOT ONLY DO I HAVE PAUSE FOR
 CONCERN TO DO ANY DEAL, BUT IF
 AND WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT,
 NOW I'M GOING TO REALLY WANT TO
 MAKE SURE THAT THE STRUCTURE IS
 APPROPRIATE WHERE WILL
 GUARANTEED MONEY, CERTAINLY IF
 HE GETS HURT PLAYING FOOTBALL.
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE
 TIEBLT -IF THERE'S A THIRD
 BUMP IN THE ROAD IN TERMS OF
 ANYTHING OFF THE FIELD.
 HE'S PUT HIMSELF IN THAT
 POSITION.
 HE'S HAD TEAMMATES THAT PLAYED
 VERY WELL, LIKE THE STARTING
 QUARTERBACK, DAK PRESCOTT AND
 HANDLED THEIR BUSINESS OFF THE
 FIELD.
 HE'S DONE THIS TO HIMSELF.
 NOT ONLY WOULD I CONSIDER
 PAUSING AND NOT DOING A
 LONG-TERM DEAL IF AND WHEN WE
 GOT TO THE POINT, THE STRUCTURE
 OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE -AS
 AN ORGANIZATION, SOMETHING ELSE
 HAPPENS, I WANT TO CUT THE
 PLAYER AND NOT HAVE TO PAY HIM
 MORE MONEY.
 THAT'S THE KEY POINT.
 IF SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS, HE
 WAS WARNED WHEN HE WAS SUSPENDED
 IN 2017.
 HE SEEMS -DAMIAN SAID HE GOT
 LUCKY BUT THEY COULD HAVE
 SUSPENDED UNDER THE PERSONAL
 CONDUCT POLICY GIVEN THAT
 WARNING.
 BUT I MEAN, THIS IS A
 TRANSCENDENT PLAYER WHO LED THE
 LEAGUE IN RUSHING TWO OF HIS
 THREE YEARS, LED THE LEAGUE IN
 RUSHING THE YEAR HE WAS
 SUSPENDED.
 TO GET TO THE POINT YOU RELEASE
 HIM, THAT HAS TO BE A PRETTY
 EXTREME SITUATION, DOESN'T IT?
 LISTEN, WE KNOW HOW THE
 LEAGUE WORKS.
 THE MORE TALENTED YOU ARE, THE
 MORE OPPORTUNITIES YOU GET.
 YOU SAID IT PERFECTLY, THE
 TRANSCENDENT TALENT.
 ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE
 IN OUR LEAGUE.
 BUT AGAIN, IF YOU'RE NOT
 AVAILABLE, WHAT GOOD ARE YOU TO
 THE TEAM?
 AGAIN, YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE
 ZEKE ELLIOTT MATURE AND GET PAST
 THESE INCIDENCES THAT WE'VE SEEN
 FROM HIM, THE THREE YEARS PLUS
 OF WHATEVER HE'S BEEN IN THE
 NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE SO HE
 CAN HELP HIS TEAM GET TO WHERE
 THEY WANT TO GO.
 PRODUCTION EQUALS TOLERANCE.
 BECAUSE HE'S PRODUCED AT SUCH A
 HIGH LEVEL, HE'S BEEN A HIGH
 LEVEL POWER.
 AT SOME POINT THAT EQUALS OUT.
 HOPEFULLY, HE CAN LEARN FROM
 THIS, GROW AND PUT ALL THIS
 BEHIND HIM AND HELP THE COWBOY
 TRY TO WIN A SUPER BOWL.
 EZEKIEL ELLIOTT REPRESENTS
 THE BIG NFL NEWS OF THE DAY.
 ON ESPN, THOUGH, WE DON'T LIMIT
 OURSELVES TO NFL.
 OUR NEXT CANADIAN FOOTBALL
 LEAGUE MATCHUP ON ESPN PLUS IS
 TOMORROW NIGHT.
 IT'S A FORMAT BETWEEN THE TIGER
 CATS AND THE MONTREAL AL OWE
 WETS.
 THAT WILL BE AT 7:30 EASTERN.
 EVERYBODY IS GOING TO SAY WE
 COULD BE AND SHOULD BE SUPER
 BOWL CONTENDERS.
 WHO WOULDN'T ASPIRE TO BE THE
 PATRIOTS.
 WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE 11-5?
 I WANT TO GET TO BE WHAT THE
 PATRIOTS ARE.
 THE CLEVELAND BROWNS GOING
 FROM THE HUNTER TO THE HUNTED
 NOW.
 OH, WHAT A CATCH BY NJOKU.
 I FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID, THE
 EXCITEMENT THAT I HAVE.
 THEY HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR NOT
 BEING A CONTENDER IN THE AFC.
 THEY HAVE NO EXCUSE.
 CLEVELAND BROWNS DAVID NJOKU
 GETTING READY FOR A HIGHLY
 ANTICIPATED SEASON IN CLEVELAND.
 DAVID, WE'VE SEEN SOME OF WHAT
 YOU GUYS CAN DO.
 CERTAINLY INDIVIDUALLY.
 WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IS FREDDIE
 KITCHENS AS A HEAD COACH.
 TELL US WHAT FREDDIE IS LIKE NOW
 THAT HE'S THE HEAD COACH?
 FREDDIE IS A GREAT HEAD
 COACH.
 I BELIEVE HE'S A PLAYER'S COACH
 IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.
 HE KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES FOR US TO
 DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
 WE KNOW AS WELL.
 EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
 HOPEFULLY GOOD THINGS HAPPEN.
 SO WE'LL SEE.
 BRINGING SOME STABILITY TO
 THAT SITUATION THIS YEAR.
 OBVIOUSLY, LAST YEAR THERE
 WASN'T.
 WHAT WAS IT LIKE GOING THROUGH
 THAT LAST YEAR WITH ALL THE
 TURMOIL AND THE FIRINGS AND ALL
 THAT STUFF IN MID-SEASON WITH
 THE COACHING STAFF.
 HOW TOUGH WAS THAT?
 YES, IT WAS A BUNCH OF
 TURMOIL.
 HAVING YOUR HEAD COACH AND O.C.
 FIRED.
 IT BROUGHT A LOT OF QUESTIONS
 AND CURIOSITY, BUT I FEEL LIKE
 AS A TEAM AND AS LIKE THE
 PLAYERS, WE TOOK IT UPON
 OURSELVES TO, YOU KNOW, TO COME
 TOGETHER AND FOCUS ON HOW WE
 HAVE TO FINISH THIS YEAR OR THIS
 PAST YEAR STRONG.
 AND I BELIEVE WE DID JUST THAT.
 AND I BELIEVE THIS UPCOMING YEAR
 WILL BE REALLY SPECIAL.
 A LOT OF TIMES PLAYERS SAY
 THE FRONT OFFICE STUFF, DOESN'T
 AFFECT THE LOCKER ROOM.
 WERE THERE HARD FEELINGS.
 IT SEEMS LIKE BAKER MAYFIELD HAD
 THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE
 SITUATION.
 WAS THAT A WIDESPREAD FEELING?
 THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, EVERYONE
 MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A
 BUSINESS.
 YOU HAVE TO TREAT IS AS SUCH.
 THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS.
 WHATEVER HAPPENED, HAPPENED.
 IT IS WHAT IT IS.
 WE'RE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE HAVE TO
 DO TO REACH OUR GOAL.
 YOU DIDN'T LACK FOR TALENT ON
 THE OFFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL
 TO BEGIN WITH.
 ODELL BECKHAM ESTABLISHED AS ONE
 OF THE TOP RECEIVING OPTIONS IN
 THE ENTIRE LEAGUE.
 WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN FROM HIM IN
 TERMS OF WHAT HE'S SHOWN YOU ON
 THE FIELD AND WHAT KIND OF
 TEAMMATE HE IS.
 YEAH.
 ODELL IS AN ELITE ATHLETE.
 WE'RE ACTUALLY ALL TOGETHER
 YESTERDAY, JARVIS, HOLLYWOOD
 HIGGINS, ME, BAKER AND A BUNCH
 OF OTHER GUYS.
 DEMETRIUS HARRIS, BROWN, WE WERE
 WORKING ON TIMING AND
 EVERYTHING.
 WHEN IT COMES TO US AS A UNIT,
 WE ARE VERY DANGEROUS IS THE
 WORD TO SAY.
 HOW ABOUT PERSONAL GOALS FOR
 YOU?
 OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE A YOUNG PLAYER
 STILL GROWING IN THIS LEAGUE,
 WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT AND SAY
 HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH
 GOING FORWARD?
 AS LONG AS I FEELEY GAVE IT
 MY ALL, I WORKED TO MY ABILITY,
 I'M CONTENT WITH THIS YEAR.
 I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY NUMBERS.
 I WAS MESSING AROUND SAYING 20
 TOUCHDOWNS, BUT HONESTLY
 SPEAKING, I WANT TO HAVE A GREAT
 YEAR.
 WE WANT TO WIN AND WIN AS MUCH
 AS POSSIBLE AND OBVIOUSLY GO TO
 THE SUPER BOWL AND THAT'S WHAT
 THE BIG TERM GOAL.
 WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING TO
 IMPROVE YOUR GAME, IS THERE
 SOMETHING YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY
 WORKING ON YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
 BETTER AT?
 OF COURSE.
 HONESTLY, SPEAKING, I'M WORKING
 ON ALL ASPECTS.
 I DON'T BELIEVE I MASTERED
 ANYTHING REGARDING THE TIGHT END
 POSITION JUST YET.
 IT'S REALLY EVERYTHING THAT I
 WANT TO WORK ON TO BETTER MYSELF
 AS AN OVERALL TIGHT END AND
 PLAYER.
 WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU A
 PERSONAL QUESTION IF THAT'S ALL
 RIGHT.
 YOU HAVE EIGHT SIBLINGS, IS THAT
 CORRECT?
 YOU'RE ONE OF NINE BROTHERS AND
 SISTERS.
 CORRECT.
 YOUR OLDER BROTHER, INNOCENT,
 STUDYING TO BE A NEUROLOGIST.
 WHAT KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS --
 NEUROSURGEON.
 EXCUSE ME.
 MORE IMPRESSIVE.
 WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS DO
 YOU HAVE ABOUT FOOTBALL AND THE
 DANGERS OF YOUR CHOSEN
 PROFESSION.
 OBVIOUSLY, HE UNDERSTANDS AS
 WELL AS I DO THAT FOOTBALL IS A
 DANGEROUS SPORT.
 I HAVE TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS, HE
 PLAYS AT MIAMI RIGHT NOW.
 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI AND
 MY YOUNGEST ONE CHARLES NJOKU,
 HE JUST ARRIVED AT UCLA TO START
 HIS SUMMER PROGRAM AS A
 RECEIVER.
 THEY BOTH PLAY RECEIVERS.
 WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT FOOTBALL
 IS OBVIOUSLY A DANGEROUS SPORT.
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS OUR
 PASSION.
 WE WORK EXTREMELY HARD TO BE THE
 BEST WE CAN BE.
 MY OLDEST BROTHER, INNOCENT, HE
 UNDERSTANDS THAT.
 HE LOVES OUR PASSION FOR IT.
 BUT OBVIOUSLY, HE'S THE ONE
 SAYING, BE CAREFUL.
 MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE AND
 EVERYTHING.
 YEAH.
 THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
 I GUESS IT CAN BE HANDY TO
 HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT IN THE
 FAMILY.
 I ALWAYS TELL HIM THAT ONCE
 THE THREE OF US ARE DONE PLAYING
 FOOTBALL, HE HAS TO TAKE CARE OF
 US IN ALL SHAPE AND FORM.
 IT'S ALL LOVE AT THE END OF THE
 DAY.
 HOPEFULLY HE DOESN'T HAVE
 MUCH TO DO IN THAT REGARD.
 DAVID, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
 JOINING US, BEST OF LUCK.
 MY PLEASURE.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 BAKER MAYFIELD, OVEN NJOKU,
 JARVIS LANDRY, RECEIVER ALONG
 WITH KAREEM HUNT IN THE
 BACKFIELD WHEN HUNT'S SUSPENSION
 IS OVER.
 THOSE FIVE COMBINED FOR 41
 TOUCHDOWNS AND 641 TOUCHES.
 SO I GUESS THE BIG QUESTION,
 GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE, IS THERE
 ENOUGH TO GO AROUND IN THAT
 CLEVELAND BROWNS OFFENSE?
 I LOT A LOT OF PIECES.
 A GREAT COLLECTION OF TALENT.
 THAT'S WHY IT FALLS ON FREDDIE
 KITCHENS.
 THE CLEVELAND BROWNS ARE IN A
 POSITION THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN A
 LONG TIME.
 THEY ARE THE HUNTED.
 IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
 POSITION TO BE IN GOING FORWARD
 IN THE SEASON.
 THEY'LL BE ON PRIMETIME A LOT.
 LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH
 IT.
 THE ONE THING WE DIDN'T SEE
 ON THE GRAPHIC WAS THE LACK OF
 EXPERIENCE OF THEIR HEAD COACH
 FREDDIE KITCHENS.
 I BELIEVE ONE DAY KITCHENS WILL
 BE A HEAD COACH.
 ONE YEAR AGO, GUYS, HE WAS A
 POSITION COACH.
 IT'S LIKE LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE
 A CAR GOING 90 MILES AN HOUR IN
 THE LEFT-HAND LANE AND IN THE
 DIVISION, YOU HAVE JOHN HARBAUGH
 AND MIKE TOMLIN SINCE 2007.
 MIKE TOMLIN HAS THE SECOND MOST
 WINS IN THE NFL.
 JOHN HARBAUGH HAS THE SIXTH MOST
 WINS.
 FROM A COACHING STANDPOINT, HOW
 FREDDIE KITCHENS CAN MELD THAT
 GROUP WILL BE INTERESTING TO
 WATCH.
 INTERESTING TO WATCH WHAT WE
 HAVE COMING STILL ON "NFL LIVE"
 TODAY.
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT SITUATION.
 COWBOYS RUNNING BACK NOT
 SUSPENDED BY THE NFL FOR HIS
 RECENT INCIDENT AND BECAUSE

           That's room         for possibility.
           That's room         for possibility.



        Look! Make a wish!
       I wish for a Biggie       Bag from Wendy's.
    I wish everyone loved each    other and was always...
   That's a great wish, Jimmy.
  Get a Bacon Double stack with  a quarter pound of fresh beef,
   nuggets, fries and a   drink for just five bucks.
  Wendy's Biggie Bag is  everything you could wish for.
