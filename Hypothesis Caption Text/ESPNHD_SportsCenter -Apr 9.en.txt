 THE GAME FOR A LONG TIME. LEADING IN REBOUNDING FOR MUCH
 OF THE YEAR AND HE GAVE THEM
 BIG-TIME MINUTES FOR TONY
 BENNETT, THEY GET THE FIRST
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP IN SCHOOL
 HISTORY IN THE MEN'S TOURNAMENT
 D ALSO WINNING THE■ FIRST ONE
 VIRGINIA AND■ THE A.C.C., E OF ;
 THAT'S NOW THEIRNATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIPú■
 THE RECORD.
 WE'LL HEAR FROM THE COACHES A
 LITTLE BIT LATER ON IN
 "SPORTSCENTER."
 BOTH CHRIS BEARD AND TEXAS TECH
 AND TONY BENNETT WINNING HIS
 FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP.
 TALKED TO TONY YESTERDAY ABOUT
 WHAT THE FEELING HE ANTICIPATED
 IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING UP THAT
 LADDER TO CUT DOWN THE NET.
 SAID HE WOULD THINK ABOUT HIS
 FAMILY.
 YOU GUYS MENTIONED DIRK BENNETT
 BEING THERE.
 THEY TODAY A PICTURE OF HIM IN
 THE STANDS.
 I'M NOT SURE HE WAS ACTUALLY
 WATCHING THE GAME.
 THE NEW CONFERENCE OF
 CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH ITS FIFTH
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.
 FOLLOWED BY THE S.E.C. AND THE
 BIG 10.
 ONE NOTE DOES STAY INTACT.
 NO TEAM HAS EVER WON HIS -IT'S
 FIRST TIME IN THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP BUT TEXAS TECH WAS
 OH, SO CLOSE.
 AND I THINK THE RESILIENCE THEY
 SHOWED THROUGHOUT THE TOURNAMENT
 AND IN THIS GAME.
 HISTORICALLY WE'VE ALWAYS SAID
 IF VIRGINIA GETS UP BY 10, IT'S
 LIKE BEING UP BY 20 FOR OTHER
 TEAMS.
 IT WASN'T THE CASE IN THIS
 TOURNAMENT.
 THEY WERE ABLE TO ANSWER EVERY
 TIME.
 JAY W.: WHEN YOU HEAR THAT
 PHRASE CALM IS CONTAGIOUS, THAT
 TRANSLATES TO THE TEAM.
 THEY NEVER SEEM RUSHED.
 TAI WAS JUST CALM AND HE SAW THE
 FACT THAT THE DEFENSE COB
 TRACTED.
 KICKED IT OUT TO DE' ANDRE
 HUNTER.
 THEY JUST MAKE THE RIGHT PLAYS.
 SOME PEOPLEHERE'S AN
 ELEMENT OF LUCK BUT YOU HAVE TO
 PUT YOURSELF IN POSITION TO GET
 THAT ELEMENT OF LUCK.
 SETH: YOU SAW THE MA WHICH YOU
 REMEMBER THE OF THE VIRGINIA
 TEAM EVERY TIME THEIR BACK WAS
 AGAINST THE WALL.
 WE SAW TY JEROME AGAINST AUBURN
 SETTLE LAST -LATE CLOCK.
 WE SAW HIM TODAY PLAY FROM THAT
 EXPERIENCE AND ATTACK DOWNHILL.
 BUT THE MA CLURLT AND POISE OF
 THIS VIRGINIA TEAM IN EVERY
 ADVE SITUATION, TO ME,
 THROUGHOUT THE TOURNAMENT --
 THIS WIL■■E THE FEWEST
  ANY TEA HAS WON A
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP BY.
 SNIRD ST. IVES?
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 BUT THEY'RE POISED EVERY TIME
 THEIR BACK WAS AGAINST IF WALL.
 A GREAT TRIBUTE TO EVERYTHING
 VIRGINIA BASKETBALL STANDS FOR.
 JAY B.: THEIR EXECUTION AT THE
 END OF A SHOT CLOCK.
 THEY LIVE FOR THE END OF THE
 SHOT CLOCK.
 NOTHING SEEMS TO WORRY THEM.
 THEY DON'T GET RUSHED AND THEY
 PLAY QUICKLY.
 I THINK TONY BENNETT CALLED IT
 PATIENT FLOW AND THEY WERE
 EXTRAORDINARY THEIR PATIENT
 WHILE STILL PROBING AND LOOKING
 TO ATTACK ALL THE TIME.
 JEROME IS A GREAT PLAYER.
 JUST A GREAT PLAYER.
 PLAYS AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS.
 HE CAN SEE OVER WITH YOU THAT
 SIZE.
 HE'S GOT THAT RUNNER, FLOATER --
 FLOATER, CAN MAKE THREES AND
 CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF YOU.
 I THOUGHT HE WAS TERRIFIC AT
 CONTROLLING THE PACE OF THE GAME
 THROUGHOUT.
 HE REBOUNDED WELL.
 HAD EIGHT ASSISTS AND ONLY
 COUGHED IT■■■■■■■P ONE TIME AGA
 THAT DEFENSE?
 THAT'S OUTSTANDING.
 RECE: OKLAHOMA CIT■8
 MINNESOTA HERE IN TOWN YESTERDAY
 AND BILLY DONOVAN HAS WON TWO
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS AND BILLY
 DONOVAN MADE A COMMENT THAT HE
 THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE
 DIFFERENT ONCE HE WON A NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP AND IT REALLY
 WASN'T.
 AS YOU SAID PRE-GAME IT PUTS ALL
 YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN A
 DIFFERENT LIGHT BUT BILLY SAID
 YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS YOU
 ACCOMPLISHED AS A GROUP FLAW
 COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH BY YOURSELF.
 VIRGINIA IS UNDERSTANDING THAT
 PROBABLY AS WELL AS YOU CAN
 RIGHT NOW, GIVEN THAT LOSE LAST
 YEAR IN THE 1-16 LOSS.
 TO LOSE IN THE ROUND OF 64 AND
 COME BACK AND WIN THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP AND NONE OF THE
 OTHER THREE DID IT QUITE LIKE
 THE HOOVES DID.
 KENNY: THE SHELL THAT WOULD LOSS
 IS OFF THEM.
 THE BALTIMORE COUNTY LOSS IS OFF
 THEM.
 ZUBIN: THEY WERE A NUMBER ONE
 SEED BUT THEY DID NOT FACE A ONE
 OR A TWO ON THEIR WAY TO THE
 CHAMPIONSHIP.
 KENNY: UNLV BEING THE LAST TO
 FULL THAT OFF.

 ZUBIN: ON THE WAY, A PROUD TONY
 BENNETT, AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT
 OF CHRIS BEARD.
 BUT THE ANTY THINKS IS --
 KENNY: THE KIDS BACK THERE IN
 VIRGINIA CELEBRATING.
 WE'RE GOING TO
        So I can buy from
 Enterprise Car Sales and you'll take ANY trade-in?
          That's right!
              Great!
          Here you go...
       Well, it does need       to be a vehicle.
     But I need this out of     my house.
   (VO) With fair, transparent   value for every trade-in...
    Enterprise makes it easy.
    WE DON'T JUST MAKE CARS...
        WE MAKE TECHNOLOGY        THAT MOVES PEOPLE

               Yeah
        Battery charging.


        Thank you So Much.
        Battery charging.

 KENNY: VIRGINIA WAS KNOCKED OUT IN THE FIRST ROUND LAST YEAR IN
 THE TOURNAMENT AS A ONE SEED.
 THEY COME ALL THE WAY THROUGH
 THIS TIME AND IN OVERTIME TAKE
 DOWN TEXAS TECH 857 IN
 OVERTIME.
 FOR THE FIRST TIME, VIRGINIA,
 NATIONAL CHAMPS OF MEN'S COLLEGE
 BASKETBALL.
 FULL COVERAGE THE REST OF THIS
 HOUR ON THE "SPORTSCENTER."
 YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE COACHES,
 PROGRAM PLAYERS, STUDENT
 MANAGERS IF THEY HAVE A RELEVANT
 THING TO OFFER AND ALL■÷&÷■■■■ú
 INTERESTING THINGS.
 INCLUDING --
 ZUBIN: THE■■TIME GAME   IN THE L
 TONIGHT.=

 MARIO CHALMERS FOR THE TIEAw/ F
 KANSAS,@@ OVERTIME.
 KANSAS WAS DOWN NINE WITH:1 TO■
 AND WIN.
 EY TAKE IT IN 2008 FOR BILL
 SELF.
 THAT WAS THE BIG 12 BEING
 VICTORIOUS.
 THE ONLY BIG 12 TEAM, BY THE
 WAY, THAT HAS WON AN NCAA
 CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE THE LEAGUE
 WAS FORMED A LITTLE OVER 20
 YEARS AGO.
 TONIGHT THE BIG 12 TEAM GOES
 DOWN.
 OVERTIME NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
 GAME?
 THERE WAS A TRIPLE OVERTIME GAME
 IN 195  WHERE NORTH CAROLINA
 KNOCKED OFF KANSAS, IF YOU'RE
 OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THAT ONE.
 15TH A.C.C. TITLE FOR VIRGINIA.
 NORTH CAROLINA, ONE OF THEIR
 FIVE TITLES BACK IN 1957 AS
 WELL.
 REMEMBER THE UMBY TWITTER FIELD?
 THEY WERE SNARKY LAST YEAR.
 KENNY: VERY CLASSY THIS TIME
 AROUND.

 ZUBIN: NO DOUBT.
 TWEETING THIS -WHAT AN
 INCREDIBLE SEASON FOR U.V.A.
 THAT WAS TRULY A TURNAROUND FOR
 THE AGES.
 ONE MORE TO DECIDE IT ALL, CHRIS
 BEARD, ONE GAME SHORT.
 FIRST FINAL FOUR ENDS IN BITTER
 DISAPPOINTMENT.
 FIRST I JUST WANT TO
 CONGRATULATE VIRGINIA BASKETBALL
 AND COACH BENNETT AND TELL THEM
 HOW MANY RESPECT WE HAVE FOR
 THEIR PROGRAM.
 THE GAME WAS EVERYTHING WE
 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
 THOUGHT IT WOULD COME DOWN TO
 ONE LAST POSSESSION AND IT DID
 IN REGULATION AND THEN IN
 OVERTIME IT JUST GOT AWAY FROM
 US A LITTLE BIT.
 NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR THEIR
 PROGRAM, THEIR COACHES, THEIR
 PLAYERS, THEIR FANS.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME IN
 TERMS OF OUR PLAYERS, I'VE NEVER
 BEEN MORE PROUD OF A TEAM THAT
 I'VE COACHED.
 I THINK WHAT THESE GUYS HAVE
 ACCOMPLISHED THIS YEAR.
 BIG 12 CHAMPIONSHIP, FINAL FOUR,
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
 WE'LL GRADUATE ALL FIVE SENIORS
 HERE IN A COUPLE MONTHS AND
 THESE GUYS WILL GO ON TO BE
 GREAT PROS AND FATHERS AND
 HUSBANDS.
 NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD OF A
 GROUP.
 A LOT OF EMOTION IN OUR LOOKER
 ROOM RIGHT NOW AND IT'S REAL.
 GUYS THAT CARE ABOUT THE GUY
 NEXT TO THEM BUT THIS IS LIFE
 AND WE'LL BOUNCE BACK.
 IN TERMS OF TEXAS TECH
 BASKETBALL, WE'RE NOT GOING
 ANYWHERE.
 WE'LL BE BACK IN THIS TOURNAMENT
 SOONER THAN LATER AND WE INTEND
 TO BE A PART OF COLLEGE
 BASKETBALL AS WE BUILD THE
 PROGRAM.
 WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS FOR THE
 STUDENT ATHLETES.
 FACE-OFF QUESTION PLEASE RAISE
 YOUR LAND?
 LET'S START IN THE BACK.
 THIS QUESTION IS FOR NOR
 REPUBLICANS.
 I GUESS JUST IN THAT --
 NORRENCE.
 IN THOSE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES,
 WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
 I THOUGHT WE NEEDED THREE.
 WE NEEDED A STOP TO WIN THE
 GAME.
 THEY CAME DOWN, HIT A THREE TO
 TIE THE GAME, SO
 YARET -JASHTE, WHAT KIND OF
 CHALLENGE DID YOU HAVE TONIGHT
 BEING GUARDED BY HUNTER FOR A
 LOT OF THE GAME AND THEN ON THE
 LAST POSSESSION WERE YOU
 THINKING THREE THE WHOLE WAY
 THERE?
 HE'S A GREAT PLAYER.
 HE PLAYED WELL TONIGHT.
 I GOT THE SWITCH, I SAW THE
 OPENING AND I TOOK THE SHOT.
 JARRETT, WHEN YOU WENT INTO
 OVERTIME, DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
 HAD OVERTIME TILL -MOMENTUM
 GOING INTO THAT?
 YEAH, WE FOR SURE FELT LIKE
 WE HAD MOMENTUM.
 HE SAID IT WAS JUST A
 FIVE-MINUTE GAME.
 WE PREPARED FOR IT EVERY DAY.
 CONTINUING WITH QUESTIONS FOR
 NORENSE OR JARRETT.
 N OFFENSE RENSE, JUST FOR
 YOU, WHAT DO YOU FEEL THE STORY
 IS OF THIS TEAM?
 I KNOW IT'S LITTLE TIME REMOVED
 FROM IT BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT THE
 STORY TO BE FOR THIS TEAM?
 RESILIENCE AND TOUGHNESS,
 EVERYTHING WE ARE AT A -AS A
 TEAM.
 IT TOOK A LOT TO GET HERE.
 WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
 TOGETHER.
 TO GET HERE IT TOOK A LOT OF
 GUTS AND I'M PROUD FOR OUR TEAM
 FOR THAT BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL
 GOOD AT ALL RIGHT NOW.
 CONTINUING WITH QUESTIONS FOR
 THE TEXAS TECH STUDENT ATHLETES,
 IF THERE ARE ANY.
 TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE ROOM.
 JARKTSE DID WE SEE YOU PLAY
 YOUR LAST GAME TONIGHT AS A RED
 RAIDER OR IS THAT DECISION STILL
 TO BE MADE?
 THAT DECISION IS STILL TO BE
 MADE.
 ALL SEASON I JUST FOCUSED ON MY
 TEAM AND TRYING TO WIN A
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP SO I
 HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ANY.
 NOW THAT THE SEASON IS OVER I'LL
 TAKE TIME WITH MY FAMILY AND
 COACH AND CONSIDER MY FUTURE.
 CONTINUING WITH QUESTIONS FOR
 JARRETT AND NORENSE, IF THERE
 ARE ANY.
 WE'D LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR
 JOINING US HERE IN THE MAIN
 INTERVIEW ROOM.
 THEY'RE GOING TO HEAD BACK TO
 THE LOCKER ROOM.
 CONGRATULATIONS, FELLOWS, ON A
 GREAT SEASON AND A GREAT RUN.
 FIRST QUESTION FOR COACH BEARD,
 PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU
 HAVE ONE.
 LET'S GO UP FRONT TO THE RIGHT.
 DAN.
 HI.
 U.S.A. TODAY.
 HUNTER MADE THAT THREE IN THE
 CORNER TO TIE THE GAME AT THE
 END OF REGULATION.
 IT LOOKED LIKE I SAW YOU
 MOTIONING.
 WERE YOU TRYING TO SAY NO THREES
 THERE?
 YOU MADE A MOTION TO YOUR TEAM.
 WHEN WE WERE ON OFFENSE OR
 DEFENSE?
 YOU GUYS WERE ON DEFENSE.
 YEAH, WE WORK ON THAT EVERY
 DAY IN PRACTICE.
 THREE-POINT LEAD.
 WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP A THREE
 SO -BUT I TRUST MY PLAYERS.
 WE WORK ON IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
 I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK AND WATCH
 THE FILM.
 IT LOOKED LIKE SOME DRIBBLE
 PENETRATION, MAYBE BASELINE AND
 A REALLY GOOD PASS BUT YEAH, IN
 THAT SITUATION WITH A
 THREE-POINT LEAD AND LESS THAN A
 SHOT CLOCK LEFT, WE'RE TRYING TO
 PLAY REALLY SOUND DEFENSE WITH
 NO THREE-POINT SHOTS NO, AND
 ONES AND WE HAVE TO SECURE THE
 DEFENSIVE REBOUND.
 WE JUST CAME UP A LITTLE BIT
 SHORT BUT GIVE VIRGINIA CREDIT.
 THEY'RE A REALLY, REALLY GOOD
 TEAM.
 SO MUCH POISE AND I JUST HAVE A
 LOT OF RESPECT FOR THEM.
 KENNY: DISAPPOINTMENT EXPRESSED
 IN THEIR FACES AND IN THEIR
 ANSWERS THERE.
 TEXAS TECH WENT TO THE TITLE.
 GOES DOWN AGAINST VIRGINIA.
 KNOWN FOR ITS DEFENSE ALL
 SEASON.
 THROUGH THE FIRST FOUR GAMES.
 OPPONENTS SCORED JUST 65 ON
 AVERAGE.
 THEY ALSO GAVE UP 11 THREES
 AFTER ALLOWING UNDER SIX IN THE
 FIRST FIVE GAMES.
 RECE DAVIS AND THE CREW.
 RECE: THAT 40% SHOOTING THAT
 TEXAS TECH ALLOWED, THE SECOND
 BEST BY AN OPPONENT THIS SEASON
 AND JARRETT CULVER STRUGGLED,
 LARGELY DUE TO THE VIRGINIA
 DEFENSE.
 HE MISSED 17 SHOTS, THE MOST
 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME SINCE 19  5.
 VIRGINIA EASE DEFENSE HAD A LOT
 TO DO WITH THAT.
 JAY B.: VIRGINIA'S DEFENSE IS
 EXCELLENT.
 IT HAS BEEN ALL SEASON.
 I THOUGHT KIHEI CLARK DID A
 GREAOUT■>■■■
 MOONEY.■■■■O■YTIME HE TRIED TO
 THE PRE WAS A DOUBLE
 ISOLATION THAT GOT IT OUT OF HI■
 ■■[ GREAT TURN OONLED
 JUMPER.
 THAT WAS ABOUT IT.
 BUT THE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE
 THAT STOOD OUT WAS HUNTER ON
 CULVER.
 HUNTER IS THE A.C.C. PLAYER
 TOOST YEAR AND HE VALIDATEED
 THAT AND THEN SOME.
 FOR HIM TO PLAY ON BOTH ENDS AT
 THE LEVEL HE PLAYED, THAT'S MOST
 OUTSTANDING PLAYER STUFF AND
 LEGENDARY STUFF.
 27 POINTS, NINE REBOUNDS AND
 HOLD Aéá POTENTIALéá LOTTERY PIN

 WERE BUT DEANDRE HUNTER, HIS
 IMPRINT ON THE GAME.
 LET'S FACE IT.
 DOWN THE STRETCH,■■TECH■■ ■GOIN
 OFF, THE BALL WAS■■■ GOING TO BN
 CULVER'S HANDS.
 LIKE IT WAS AT THE END  THE
 OTHER NIGHT SO THEIR ABILITY TO
 TAKE HIM OUT WAS HUGE.
 THE END OF THE GAME, YOU CANNOT
 HELP OFF CORNER AND THAT PLAY
 ADVERSITY.AY AT THE END■■■■■■■■
 IT'S ONE OF THE BEST STORIES I
 THINK EVER IN■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■T
 IN THAT SITUATION FO■■■■■■■■■■■H
 CLASS.
 BUT FOR THIS TEAM TO WIN THE BIG
 12 AFTER KANSAS HAS DOMINATED
 GOING ON 14 YEARS, FOR THEM TO
 LOSE IN A BIG 123 TOURNAMENT TO
 WEST VIRGINIA, TO BOUNCE BACK
 THE WAY THEY DID IN THE NCAA
 TOURNAMENT, THEY'VE HAD A
 TREMENDOUS YEAR.
 RECE: LOST FIVE OF THEIR TOP SIX
 SCORERS FROM A YEAR AGO.
 THEY'VE WON AS MANY NCAA
 TOURNAMENT GAMES AS Y HAVE IN
 THEIR ENTIRE PROGRAM.
 THAT CORNER, IF MEMORY SERVES,
 THAT'S THE SAME CORNER KYLE GUY
 HIT THE THREE AGAINST AUBURN
 TOO.
 THERE WAS ONE PLAY IN OVERTIME
 AND IT'S GOTTEN SOME ATTENTION.
 FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, THE
 OFFICIALS, WHEN THEY WENT TO THE
 MONITOR TO SEE IF IT WASUT OF
 BOUNDS AND VIRGINIA WAS AWARDED
 THE BALL.
 I THOUGHT THEY GOT THE CALL■■■■
 CALL RILINGTE RIGHT AS WELL.
 SETH: IT WAS A HECK OF AN FIRST
 QUARTERED GAME.
 THERE'S NONONE PLAY YOU SAY
 WHAT.
 IF
 JAY W.: FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD ■.
 JAY B.: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
 ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE
 OFFICIATING.
 RECE: 85-77, JUST THE WAY
 EVERYBODY HAD IT DRAWN UP.
 TOOK THEM A WHILE TO GET GOING
 OFFENSIVELY BUT MAN, WHAT A
 GAME.
 VIRGINIA IS THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPION.
 KENNY: SOME OF YOU DEBATE SEE
 THE WHOLE GAME.
 YOU WERE TOO BUSY WATCHING
 BASEBALL HIGHLIGHTS WITH US.
 TEXAN, CULVER MINIATURE.
 DRIVING.
 JUST 5-22 FROM THE FLOOR
 THAT WAS BIG.
 TECH WITH THE LEAD.
 IA DOWN THREE, UNDER 20 TO
 GO.
 KICK TO THE CORNER.
 DEANDRE HUNTER, THANK YOU FOR MY
 LIFE, TIES THE GAME.
 HUNTER T THREE.
 TIED AT 6 -6 .
 CULVER, LONG JUMPER.1ALF.
 NOT GOOD.
 HE WAS TRYING TIME-OUT  CK OUT E
 BUT THE PASS WENT THROUGH
 OUT OF BOUNDS SO ONE SECOND,
 THEY GOT A PLAY BUT THE SHOT IS
 REDACTED BYRAXTON KEY.

 JEROME DRIVE@p■h MISSES.

 POKED AWAY.
 WHOSE BALL?
 NOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE MONO
 FIGURE -MONITOR FOR 10, 15 --
 IT'S OVERTURNED AND GIVEN TO
 VIRGINIA OFF HIS■■ FINGERNAIL.
 JEROME COMING TO THE RACK.
 DRAWLS THE FOUL.
 WE BELIEVE THE INSIDE.
 AND SIMILARLY, IN THEIR
 SEMIFINAL GAME FREE THROWS
 MATTER.
 THEY HIT THEM THERE.
 JEROME HITS;/x■g■g■gçW■WHE SHOO
 EXTEND THE LEAD IN THIS CASE.
 ANOTHER TOUGH CALL ON MATT
 MOONEY AND VIRGINIA FOR THE
 FIRST TIME IS NATIONAL CHAMPIONS
 OF MEN'S NCAA BASKETBALL.
 85-77 YOUR FINAL.
 TEXAS TECH FOUGHT HARD TO GET
 THERE.
 A 31-WIN SEASON BUTñ7ñ7ñ7HEY COP
 JUST SHORT.
 HERE WAS AN EMOTIONAL COACH
 CHRIS BEARD JUST AFTER THE
 COACH, IT LOOKED LIKE YOU
 STOPPED TO TALK TO A COUPLE OF
 GUYS BEFORE YOU WALKED OFF THE
 FLOOR.
 WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM
 AFTER THE GAME THERE?
 JUST -PHAU!
 -PPHEW!
 JUST TOLD THEM I LOVED THEM AND
 OUR RELATIONSHIP IS JUST GETTING
 STARTED.
 I'LL BE AT THOSE GUYS' WEDDINGS
 ONE DAY AND HOPEFULLY WHEN THEIR
 KIDS GET BORN AND DO EVERYTHING
 I CAN TO TALK THEM OUT OF
 GETTING INTO COACHING SO THEY
 DON'T EVER FEEL LIKE THIS BUT I
 JUST LOVE THOSE GUYS.
 IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR
 COACH BEARD, PLEASE RAISE YOUR
 HAND.
 COACH, ON LAST VIRGINIA
 POSSESSION OF REGULATION, DID
 YOU CONSIDER FOULING AT ALL AT
 THE THREE?
 I THINK THERE WERE 22 SECONDS
 LEFT.
 A LITTLE EARLY.
 WE'VE GOT SOME CALLS.
 GIVE VIRGINIA CREDIT.
 IF THEY HAD COME DOWN AND RUN A
 MORE DELIBERATE POSSESSION LIKE
 THEY NORMALLY DO, WE WOULD HAVE
 FOULED UP TOP.
 WE HAVE SOME SIGNALS.
 WE WERE READY FOR THAT.
 TO ME, THEY GOT REAL AGGRESSIVE
 AND DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO DO
 THAT.
  WE WERE PREPARED FOR THAT.
 WE WORK ON IT EVERY DAY AND I
 TRUST MY PLAYERS.
 I'LL ALWAYS BE A GUY THAT TRUSTS
 PLAYERS.
 KENNY: CRYING IS HEALTHY.
 CHRIS BEARD DID SOME OF THAT
 EXPRESSING HIS DEVOTION TO THE
 TEAM AND HOW HE EXPRESSED
 HIMSELF TO HIS TEAM AFTER A
 DIFFICULT LOSS IN OVERTIME.
 VIRGINIA TRAILED IN THE FINAL 20
 SECOND IN THE SECOND HALF IN
 EACH OF THE LAST THREE GAMES.
 THEY WON ALL OF THEM AND TEXAS
 TECH IN THE TITLE GAME.
 ZUBIN:  FROM THE DECEMBER SPARE
 OF HEARING THOSE WORDS FROM
 CHRIS BEARD TO THE ELATION OF
 TONY BENNETT.
 WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM AND SOME

  I think I could be considered  a Grilled Chicken Sandwich  influencer.

   about the Grilled Chicken   Sandwich is the first bite.
 I love how juicy the chicken is but there's also the tomatoes
       and the lettuce and       it's incredible.

   I know what you're thinking.
   Electric, it's not for you.
   And, you're probably right.
      Electric just doesn't      have enough range.
       It will never       survive the winter.
        Charging stations?
 Good luck finding one of those.
    So, maybe an electric car    isn't for you after all.
            Or, is it?

  I'm Paige, and well the little  thing that I like about the
   Grilled Chicken Sandwi  that'.
   It's juicy and it just has   all the right combinations.
  I think I could be considered  a Grilled Chicken Sandwich  influencer.
     My name is Frank and the     little thing I like
   about the Grilled Chicken   Sandwich is the first bite.
 I love how juicy the chicken is but there's also the tomatoes
       and the lettuce and       it's incredible.
       Make sure you get it       with waffle fries,
   because that's my favorite.

 NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK, NEVER MIND.
 YEAH, IT WAS A GREAT PLAY.
 HE DREW IT UP.

 ZUBIN: LIVE ON "SPORTSCENTER,"
 THE CHAMPIONS HAVE ARRIVED.
 WE WERE RUNNING ACTION AND I
 THOUGHT WE'D GET IT.
 SORRY.
 THE THREE, YOU HIT THE SAME
 THING IN OVERTIME.
 IT WASREAT PASS AND GREAT
 SHOT.
 (8R] 8WE'RE A LITTLE CONFUSE
 WHICH PLAY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
 MAYBE WE'LL GET BACK TO IT.
 LET'S GO TO THE RIGHT OF THE
 AISLE.
 MIKE.
 KYLE AND TY, A YEAR AGO
 SITTING AT THE PODIUM, THE
 EMOTIONS YOU FELT.
 TO BE HERE NOW AS THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPION, CAN  TRY TO
 PUT INTO WORDS WHAA
 EL RIGHT NOW?
 MIKE, WHO WAS THAT FIRST?
 TY FIRST, PLEASE, THEN KYLE.
 I WAS GOING TO SAY DON'T ASK
 ME.
 FORGET LAST YEAR.
 THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU DREAM OF
 SINCE YOU'RE A LITTLE KID.
 I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT UMBC
 RIGHT NOW.
 I'M JUST THINKING THIS IS A
 DREAM COME TRUE AND IT'S EVEN
 MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE YOU NEVER
 IMAGINE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND
 A YEAR WITH PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY
 LOVE.
 YOUR TEAMMATES AND YOUR COACHES.
 NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET ALONG
 LIKE WE DO.
 SO TO SHARE THIS MOMENT WITH
 THEM IS UNBELIEVABLE.
 KYLE?
 YEAH, WE CAME IN TOGETHER AND
 SAID THAT WE WERE GOING TO WIN A
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP AND TO BE
 ABLE TO HUG EACH OTHER WITH
 CONFETTI GOING EVERYWHERE AND
 SAY WE DID IT, IT'S THE GREATEST
 FEELING I'VE EVER FELT IN
 BASKETBALL.
 NANCY?
 USA TODAY SPORTS.
 KYLE, HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR
 SCREEN SETTING OR YOUR AVATAR?
 I'LL GET AROUND TO IT.
 WHEN YOU WERE WRITING THE
 LETTERS, DID YOU VISUALIZE IN
 YOUR MIND GOING FROM THAT TO
 THIS AND HOW CLOSELY DOES IT
 RESEMBLE THAT IF YOU DID?
 YEAH, I THINK EVERYONE ON THE
  SOON AS THE BUZZER
 SOUNDED AND WE WERE DONE WITH
 THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND STUFF.
 WE KNEW WE ALL HAD THE SAME GOAL
 IN MIND FOR NEXT YEAR AND THAT
 WAS TO WIN THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP.
 YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL HAD OUR OWN
 BATTLES AND I SAID EARLIER THAT
 IT'S A REALLY SPECIAL GROUP
 BECAUSE WE ALL HAD THE SAME WHY
 BUT TO SHARE THE SAME ONE AND
 BATTLE AND COME OUT ON TOP IS A
 FANTASTIC FEELING.
 JEFF?
 YOU SAID TO ME THAT WHEN YOU
 GOT BACK TO CAM PUT LAST TIME,
 YOU HAD THE HOOD ON, HEAD DOWN.
 WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE NOW?
 WHAT IS THIS ALL LIKE FOR YOU
 RIGHT NOW?
 YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SHED A TEAR.
 HAVE ANY OF YOU SHE WOULD A TEAR
 YET?
 I DID.
 YOU DID?
 THE OTHER TWO VAFPBLET WHEN
 KILLED YOU SHED A TEAR, TY?
 WHEN HE HIT THAT FLOATER IN
 REGULATION.
 [LAUGHTER]
 MAN, IF I'D MADE, THAT THEY
 WOULD HAVE SCORED, WE WOULD HAVE
 LOST BUT WHEN I HUGGED MY MOM
 AND DAD AND MY BROTHER, THEY
 WERE TRI-CRYING SO I COULDN'T
 HELP IT.
 TY, WHAT A ROLLER COASTER
 RIDE.
 TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE TOURNAMENT
 IN GENERAL AND JUST YOUR
 MENTALITY GOING IN THESE
 LAST-SECOND WINS ALL THE TIME.
 JUST TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO
 THE LITTLE THINGS.
 COACH BENNETT ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT
 STAYING FAITHFUL AND HE TOLD US
 DON'T GROW WEARY.
 THAT'S A POSSESSION MINDSET, A
 LIFE MINDSET.
 JUST PLAY TILL THE BUZZER
 SOUNDS.
 THE FACT I MISSED THAT FLOATER
 IN REGULATION AND COACH BENNETT
 CALLED THE EXACT SAME PLAY SHOWS
 HOW MUCH MY TEAMMATES BELIEVE IN
 ME, HOW MUCH HE BELIEVES IN ME.
 WE ALL BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER AND
 IT'S THE MOST SPECIAL TEAM I'VE
 EVER B
 TY, YOU TALKED YESTERDAY
 ABOUT HOW GROWING UP YOU WOULD
 WATCH NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
 GAMES, STAYING UP LATE TO WATCH
 THEM.
 YOU MENTIONED THE MARIO CHALMERS
 SHOT.
 WHAT'S IT LIKE KNOWING KIDS
 STAYED UP PAST THEIR BEDTIME TO
 WATCH WHEN YOU GUYS JUST DID?
 YEAH, IT'S UNREAL.
 I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO REFLECT ON
 ANYTHING.
 IT STILL DON'T FEEL REAL.
 STILL DOESN'T FEEL REAL.
 COME ON, BR ORGANIZATION, TALK
 PROPERLY.
 THIS IS FOR CAME.
 THE QUESTION WAS KIND OF ASKED
 BEFORE BUT HOW MANY DID LAST
 WEEKEND'S GAMES HELP PREPARE YOU
 BUYS FOR A STRETCH RUN LIKE THIS
 AND PARTICULARLY -PARTICULARLY
 ALSO THE SEMIFINAL GAME?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK WE'VE TAKEN EVERY
 EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE BEEN
 THROUGH TOGETHER AND TRIED TO
 USE IT IN A WAY THAT COULD  ■66
 CHAMPIONSHIP.
 YOU KNOW, A
 AND ALL THE PRACTICES WHERE WE
 PRACTICED LATE-GAME SITUATIONS,
 WE TRIED EXECUTE AND WE WERE
 VERY DISCIPLINED AND I THINK
 THAT GOT US THROUGH A LOT OF
 GAMES, ALONG WITH JUST TRYING TO
 LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FLOOR AND I
 THINK WE SUCCEEDED AT THOSE
 THINGS.
 THIS WILL BE THE FINAL
 QUESTION FOR THE STUDENT
 ATHLETES.
 THIS IS FOR KYLE AND TY.
 IT'S A LOCK HAUL TO A NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP FOR ANY TEAM,
 PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT LONGER FOR
 YOU GUYS.
 CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING THROUGH
 AND IT SURVIVING AND IT GETTING
 TO THIS POINT WITHOUT -WITH
 ANY OTHER COACH OTHER THAN COACH
 BENNETT?
 TY, YOU CAN GO FIRST.
 THEN KYLE, THEN DE'ANDRE.
 UH, WHY WOULD IT BE LONGER
 FOR US THANO'S, THOUGH?
 PERHAPS BECAUSE YOU DON'T
 WANT TO MENTION OR THINK ABOUT
 WHAT HAPPENED HOW LAST YEAR
 ENDED.
 OH, YEAH.
 FOR US IT ACTUALLY WASN'T LIKE
 THAT.
 LAST YEAR IT DREW US EVEN CLOSER
 TOGETHER AND IT MADE US ENJOY
 EVERY PART OF THE SEASON EVEN
 MORE AND MADE US ENJOY EACH
 OTHER'S COMPANY ON THE ROAD.
 WE GREW CLOSER OFF THE COURT.
 SO IT WASN'T LIKE A RUSH TO GET
 TO THIS CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AND
 WIN IT SO WE COULD PROVE ALL YOU
 GUYS WRONG.
 WE JUST GREW MORE UNITTED AND
 ENJOYED EVERY PART OF THE SEASON
 AND OBVIOUSLY TO FINISH THE YEAR
 LIKE THIS IS UNREAL AND TO
 ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO, WE
 COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS WITH ANY
 OTHER COACH.
 TO EXPAND MORE ON THAT, COACH
 SAID SOMETHING THAT REALLY
 RESONATED WITH US IS RUN TO THE
 START LINE, NOT THE FINISH LINE
 AND WE'VE DONE THAT EVERY SINGLE
 GAME THIS YEAR AND -BUT TO BE
 ABLE TO GIVE HIM A NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP AND DO IT FOR HIM,
 THE PROGRAM AND OUR FAMILIES, IT
 MEANS THE WORLD AND I WISH I HAD
 THE WORDS BUT IT STILL DOES NOT
 FEEL REAL.
 DE'ANDRE?
 YEAH!
 JOY IS IN THE COMPETITION, LIKE
 KYLE SAID.
 IT WAS A GREAT WIN FOR OUR
 PROGRAM, GREAT WIN FOR OUR
 COACH.
 WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THIS ALL
 OFF-SEASON AND ALL THAT WORK
 JUST PAID OFF.
 ZUBIN: TECH HAS FIVE GUYS IN
 DOUBLE FIGURES, VIRGINIA HAD
 THREE.
 THE THREE AT THE PODIUM.
 THEY COMBINED TO SCORE 6 .
 THEIR MOST IN THE GAME THIS
 SEASON IN THE GAME THAT MATTERED
 MOVEMENTS BACK TO THE COLLEGE
 GAME DAY GUYS, RECE DAVIS.
 RECE: THE VIRGINIA FANS ARE
 ALREADY DEEP IN REVELRY AND
 THEY'VE ALSO PICKED UP SOME
 OTHERS ALONG THE WAY TO HELP
 THEM OUT IN THEIR CELEBRATION
 AND I'M TOLD IN CHARLOTTESVILLE
 THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME AND
 THERE'S NAME CHANGE UNDER WAY
 TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MR.
 BENNETT'S UNIVERSITY.
 THE PLAYERS COULDN'T QUITE
 RECALL THE PLAY THAT WAS BEING
 QUESTIONED.
 THE DE'ANDRE HUNTER THREE FROM
 THE CORNER.
 WE REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW IT
 HAPPENED.
 JAY B.: IT  UPc'''■■■■ HIS SMAR
 ABILITY TO HANDLE THE BALL AND
  PEOPLE.
 RIGHT NOW VIRGINIA BRINGING THE
 BALL UP.
 THROWN THREE WITH ABOUT 20
 SECONDS TO GO!
 JEROME WITH THE LEFT-HAND DRIVE
 TO THE BASELINE.
 HE DREW TWO DEFENDERS.
 THIS W■■w■ssPEútt■ BY DE'ANDRE
 HUNTER IN THE CORNER WHEN HE
 KICKED IT OUT.
 THAT'S A WIDE-OPEN THREE WHEN
 THE ONLY THING IN THAT SITUATION
 IS YOU CANNOT GIVE UP AS A
 THREE.
 BUT JEROME THROUGHOUT THE CORES
 -COURSE OF THE SEASON AND THIS
 GAME.
 HE WOULD KEEP HIS DRIBBLE AND
 COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE.
 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HUNTER
 WOULD HAVE GOT THAN SHOT BUT
 THAT WAS ONE OF THE FUME
 DEFENSIVE LAPSES THAT TEXAS TECH
 HAD IN THIS GAME AND IN A WAY
 COST THEM THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP BUT IT SHOWS AND
 YOU SHOWS EVERYBODY THAT
 VIRGINIA DOESN'T LOSE THEIR
 POISE AND THEY STAY IN
 CHARACTER.
 SETH: THAT PLAY, YOU THINK ABOUT
 IT.
 YOU SEE THE SCREEN BY BRAXTON
 KEY.
 TEXAS TECH CHANGED THAT.
 AND ODIASE NEVER GOT A GOOD
 ANGLE.
 HERE COMES TWO DEFENDERS.
 POOR KEUN COMMATION --
 COMMUNICATION.
 HUNTER IS WIDE OPEN, WOW, THEY
 KNOCK DOWN THE THREE.
 THERE IS A PLAY THEY'D LOOK BACK
 AND SAY.
 IF'D ASSY HAD PORSED HIM BACK,
 CAN'T GET THE HELP.
 GREAT POISE BY JEROME BUT JAY,
 YOU SAID IT RIGHT.
 ALL S?NG,■ AUBURN, PURDUE,
 EVERY TIME IN THIS SITUATION
 THEY REMAINED POISED.
 CALM.
 CALM IS CONTAGIOUS, THAT'S OUR
 NEW SEASON.
 JAY W.: ARE WE GOING TO MAKE
 CALM IS CONTAGIOUS APUBLICABLE
 IN YOUR LIFE?
 SETH: NO, CALM IS CHAOS FOR ME.
 [LAUGHTER]
 JAY W.: ONE OF THE REPORTERS
 ASKED TY JEROME, HOW DO YOU PUT
 THIS INTO WORDS AND HE SAID I
 CAN'T CO-THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT
 THEY'LL EVER BE ABLE TO CARRY --
 PUT THAT INTO WORDS -INTO
 WORDS.
 IT'S A FEELING YOU'LL CARRY THE
 REST OF YOUR LIVES.
 WATCHING THEM BATTLE THROUGH
 ADVERSITY AND STAY WITH IT.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF TEAMS, SOME
 PLAYERS WILL CHECK OUT.
 THESE DUDES ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE
 THEY BOUGHT IN AND BELIEVED IN
 EACH OTHER AND THEIR COACH AND I
 THINK THAT RESONATE TONIGHT
 COURT ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT THAT.
  BELIEF AND THE PAST THREE
 GAMES, THE WAY THEY'VE WON HAHN
 INCREDIBLE.
 IT'S ONE OF THE BEST STORIES IN
 THE NCAA TOURNAMENT I'VE EVER
 SEEN, EVER.
 SETH: YOU DON'T GO 63-4 UNLESS
 TE AND YOU REALLY BELIEVE
 AND BUY INTO WHAT THE VISION
 YOUR COACHES HAVE.
 TONY BENNETT SET A VISION WHEN
 HE ARRIVED AT VIRGINIA.
 HE SAID YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO
 LOSE BEFORE YOU LEARN TO WIN AND
 MAYBE THAT APPLIED TO THE NCAA
 TOURNAMENT.
 YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO LOSE AND IT
 MIGHT HAVE BEEN PAINFUL, THE
 1-16, BEFORE YOU CAN L TO
 WIN A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.
 JAY B.: I DON'T KNOW IF LAST
 YEAR'S LOSS TO UMBC REALLY
 FACTORED THAT MUCH INTO THE
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.
 I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THOSEa
 THINGS LIKEa  A SPORTS
 PSYCHOLOGISTERE IT
 SUCH A HUGE HURDLE BUT I THINK
 THE FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN A
 WINNING PROGRAM FOR IN LONG.
 THE LAST TWO YEARS, THEY HARDLY
 EVER LOSE AND LOOK, THEY HAD A
 COUPLE MIRACLES THIS YEAR,
 AGAINST PURDUE AND AUBURN.
 THOSE WERE MIRACLE-TYPE FINISHES
 BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
 WIN A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP THE
 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE CLOSE
 GAMES BUT THE WAY THEY PERFORMED
 GAME AFTER GAME AFTER GAME.
 THESE GUYS ARE LEGIT ON BOTH
 ENDS OF THE FLOOR AND THEY'RE
 ATLANTAED.
 RECE: THOSE THREE STARS.
 DE'ANDRE HUNTER TURNED IN AS
 GOOD AN INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE
 H ENDS ADDS YOU'LL■ SEE.
 JEROME HAD 26-6 IN THE NCAA
 TOURNAMENT.
 THE MOST SINCE DERRICK ROSE AND
 CAME GUY, HE WAS JUST THE MOST
 OUTSTANDING PLAYER OF THE FINAL
 FOUR.
 KENNY: IF THIS GAME DIDN'T WORK
 OUT FOR YOU, THERE'S ALWAYS NEW
 ALASKA.
 FUTURE BETS, KENTUCKY AND
 VIRGINIA, YOU 1.
 DUKE AND MICHIGAN, 8-1.
 TEXAS TECH GETTING NO RESPECT.

 THERE'S NO SHAME IN FINISH
 SECOND IN THIS.
 THEY TWICE CAME BACK FROM
 DOUBLE-DIGIT DEFICITS AND IF NOT
 FOR THE THREE BY DE'ANDRE
 HUNTER, WE WOULD HAVE SPENT IN
 WHOLE TIME CELEBRATING TEXAS
 TECH.
