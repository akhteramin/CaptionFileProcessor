and they literally gave all they had. Narrator: And for the prosecutors, the Telexfree fraud is one for the record books. Lelling: The success of the pyramid scheme and the speed with which it grew and took over the world is unlike any other fraud case I've done in about 15 years as a fraud prosecutor. To do that much damage in that short a period was really amazing and just showed you how dangerous these kinds of scams are. --<font color=#ffff00> Captions by VITAC</font> -
- Narrator: In this episode of American Greed... Glafira Rosales is a novice to the New York art scene, but she has all the right moves. She really played the relationships right. Narrator: She says she holds the key to a treasure trove of never-before-seen masterpieces. Jackson Pollock with famous drip paintings, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell. These are paintings that go for millions of dollars each. Narrator: A tale with enough mystique to draw millionaire buyers... Collectors are greedy for recognition and for artwork that lends them prestige. Narrator: But before you open your wallet, you may want to look twice... Every aspect of the story behind those paintings was a red flag. Narrator: It turns out skilled forgers know how to splash paint, too... Glafira Rosales was able to take 63 paintings, get $33 million dollars out of them, and then the galleries sold them for $81 million dollars. Narrator: And Glafira Rosales is a modern master in the art of the con. The experts believed it. Collectors bought it. It was auctioned off by big auction houses. I mean, this woman was sitting on top of the world. Teeming with galleries, museums, and hundreds of art dealers, New Yorkers work hard to keep their art capital booming. So in 2011, when one of New York's most venerable art galleries suddenly closes its doors, the art world is in shock. Knoedler & Company has been in business since 1846 and according to art historian Jack Flam, they've held a sterling pedigree. Knoedler & Company had one of the largest reputations of any art gallery in the country and one of the largest reputations of any gallery in the world. Narrator: Its legacy was built by supplying art to Gilded Age tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and J.P. Morgan. Over the years it evolved. It handled old master paintings. It handled modern master paintings. And then from around 1970 or so, handled contemporary art. And in each one of those domains, it really handled Blue-Chip Art. Narrator: Knoedler's closing after 165 years is surprising, but the real kicker comes when rumors start to surface that Knoedler is embroiled in a massive art fraud. People who had bought paintings from Knoedler were coming forward, having their paintings forensically tested. And soon former federal prosecutor Jason Hernandez and U.S. investigators will prove that a supplier provided the gallery with fakes, sold for millions of dollars to some of America's wealthiest collectors. What those paintings represented would have been one of the greatest finds of the abstract American Expressionist school. And these are paintings that go for millions of dollars each. Narrator: Knoedler, along with the gallery's director Ann Freedman, say they've been fleeced just like their clients by a persuasive swindler named Glafira Rosales. Glafira Rosales is an incredibly sophisticated con artist. Narrator: Maria Konnikova is the author of The Confidence Game, a book about fraudsters. She became intrigued with the story when the rumors started to erupt. What drew me to it wasn't just kind of the glamour of the art fraud world, but how it is that incredibly smart people sometimes believe things that, to an outsider, seem incredibly dumb. Narrator: According to court documents, Glafira Rosales and her boyfriend, Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz, arrive in the U.S. sometime in the early 1980s. We don't know that much about what her life was like in Mexico, which was her home country. We know that she worked in different jobs in the United States, some in the art field. Narrator: First, they settle in Houston, where Glafira waits tables and Jose finds work as a kitchen helper. It takes them little over a year to earn enough money to move to the real city of dreams -
- New York. In 1986, Rosales is granted permanent residence. She and Jose Bergantiños have a daughter and buy a small house in the suburbs. Rosales even fulfills her childhood aspiration and opens a small gallery business called King's Fine Art. Konnikova: What Glafira Rosales told people was that she was from a family that loved art, that had a lot of people come to their house for art salons. And so from a very young age, she was fascinated by this world. Narrator: Sometime later, Rosales meets a well-liked figure in the New York art scene, who happens to hold a position at Knoedler Gallery. He offers to set up a meeting with the gallery's director, Ann Freedman. Konnikova: Ann Freedman was pretty new as the director of Knoedler. She'd been very successful in her art career and someone who knows how to sell things to people, which is what you need in the art world. But now she really wanted to make a mark as the female director of this really prominent gallery. Narrator: As luck would have it, Rosales is looking to make her mark, too. So in 1995, when 40 year-old Glafira Rosales breezes into Knoedler & Company with a canvas, she's the epitome of a well-dressed and cultivated art dealer. Lawyer Luke Nikas represented Ann Freedman in what's been called the art trial of the century. You have a woman who's unassuming. She's not slick. She doesn't have this well-planned story. She's got a relationship with a man who inherited the painting from his father, and he lived in Mexico. And he just wanted to get rid of this collection. Narrator: Freedman leads Rosales upstairs to a small drawing room. The painting's warm peachy background with two ethereal clouds of color is immediately recognizable as the work of Mark Rothko -
- a leading artist of the abstract-expressionist movement. Rothko, along with Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and a few select others, were leaders of the abstract
- expressionist movement that emerged in New York during the 1940s. That handful of artists are the artists that are the most valued, have the largest reputation, and in some cases, also fetch the highest prices. Narrator: People don't walk in off the street carrying a Rothko, and Ann Freedman knows it. When questioned, Rosales spins her tale of growing up in a prominent Catholic family in Mexico, surrounded by the crème de la crème of society. That's where Glafira came in contact with the heir to a secret art collection -
- a man she refers to only as Mr. X. To begin, she would try to sell the collection of a painter friend, someone whose confidentiality she wanted to respect and so he became known as Mr. X. Narrator: Mr. X's father had been a patron of the abstract expressionist art scene. He purchased artworks straight from the artist's studios, paying in cash, so the assets and taxes were never declared. According to Rosales, there's another family secret that needs to be kept... Flam: This man was married and had a family and he was a closet homosexual, and in Mexico, supposedly, it was dangerous to be a homosexual at that time. And so the man had died and now his son was selling the pictures, but he wanted to do it as discreetly as possible. Narrator: But there's a bonus, and it's alluring. This Rothko is just the tip of the iceberg. Her secretive client has a collection of previously unknown works by Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and more. A Pollock painting in 2015 went for $200 million. Only a few years before that, a Rothko went for $86 million dollars. They're really big numbers involved. Narrator: This collection has been hidden in storage for decades. But Rosales is not an expert in abstract expressionism and her own gallery is too small. It doesn't seem to matter that few in the art world have heard of Rosales... This art is some of the most valued art of the 20th century. People paid tens of millions of dollars for it, and we haven't had anything new in it for a while. Narrator: The gallery's new director, Ann Freedman, is dazzled by the prospect and profits. Up next on American Greed... Rosales' promise of a trove of masterworks is too good to pass up. Can you imagine being the one to discover this previously-unknown treasure trove of abstract expressionist art?

Narrator: Up until now, Glafira Rosales has been circling the fringes of the New York art scene. She didn't know that much about art, to be perfectly honest, but she picked up a lot from the people around her. Narrator: Her new contact, Ann Freedman, the director of Knoedler Gallery, has the power to launch her into the upper echelons. Glafira was delivering a great product that she knew would catch the attention of the right people. Narrator: Glafira's portrayal of the unassuming novice is picture perfect. I always think about the excitement that Ann Freedman felt, like the excitement you might feel finding dinosaur bones. It's this unearthed discovery. Narrator: But a slight drawback emerges -
- the recorded history of ownership that proves its authenticity is called provenance, and this one is murky. Hernandez: Provenance is a really important concept in the art world. The story was that they were purchased by a family, a collector, directly from the artist, often purchased outside the back of the gallery in exchange for cash, and they had been kept in storage, basically, for decades. So if you believe that story, the lack of provenance actually makes sense. Narrator: So over the next decade, Glafira Rosales provides Knoedler with a few new paintings each year, all by heavy hitters. She sells additional works to art broker Julian Weissman -
- another New York art dealer. Her anonymous collector, Mr. X, turns out to be the gift horse that keeps on giving. The most high-profile artists -
- Jackson Pollocks, Rothkos, Motherwell's. I mean, you name it, it was there. Narrator: And discretion is fundamental to the rare-art market, where collectors are often tightlipped about selling. Hernandez: Secrecy is highly prized in the art world. When you're a buyer, you're not entitled, for example, to know who the seller is, or if a broker comes in with a piece of art, they don't have to necessarily disclose who their client is. Narrator: Still, Rosales' secret collector poses a vexing setback when it comes to negotiating prices. The more provenance you have, the more detail you have, the more likely the work is gonna sell for a higher price, because the backup is there. Narrator: When Ann Freedman pushes her for more details, Rosales names David Herbert, a deceased New York art dealer as the go-between. She hears the name David Herbert as someone who has been associated with these artists, who was also part of the gay community at the time. And so, all of a sudden, David Herbert can be someone who's connected to Mr. X. Narrator: To help shore up the murky provenance, Knoedler shows the works to art experts to get<i> their</i> opinions. Ann Freedman, Knoedler Gallery showed these paintings, including the very first one that came in the door to some of the finest experts in the world on Mark Rothko. They saw these paintings, several of them, and said these are convincing. Narrator: Art historian Jack Flam recalls viewing a painting at Knoedler by Robert Motherwell. Flam: She showed me a Motherwell elegy that was on the floor in her office and she said that she had just got it. Flam had been close friends with Motherwell until his death in 1991. The work is credited to Motherwell's Spanish elegy series -
- and it catches him by surprise. Flam: In the elegies, which became his signature paintings. From 1948 to when he died, in 1991, he painted over a 170 elegy paintings. They're also the paintings of his that fetch the highest prices on the market. Narrator: Freedman never mentions the name Glafira Rosales. Instead, the works are generally referred to as the Herbert Collection. And she asked me if I remember correctly, at that time, whether I had ever heard of someone named David Herbert. And I said, No, I had not. And she said, He was a well-known art dealer. And, you know, at the time, I thought, Well, you know, that's nice. Narrator: Jack Flam doesn't think of questioning Knoedler's rock-solid reputation. And so, you know, you're in Knoedler, you don't think twice. Narrator: And, of course, there's that added boon for buyers who are willing to accept the lack of documentation. Man: 1,400,000 is bid. These are artists that are really, really difficult to get and that command incredibly high prices. Now imagine you can get those works, and at a bargain price. So not only are you a brilliant art collector, you're also a pretty genius businessman. Narrator: Some collectors are more wary than others. Rosales sells this purported Jackson Pollock to Knoedler for $750,000. In 2001, Knoedler turns around and sells it to Jack Levy, a co-chairman at Goldman Sachs, for $2 million. With one caveat -
- The sale hinges on Knoedler obtaining a review verifying its authenticity from the International Foundation for Art Research -
- otherwise known as IFAR. Nikas: It had a panel of experts put together to give their views about the painting, and they wrote a report. Narrator: But IFAR won't positively attribute the work to Pollock and deems the provenance questionable. Knoedler discreetly cancels Levy's sale and refunds his $2 million, but Knoedler's mission is to sell. Nikas: These works were really exciting. And some really smart, prominent people bought these works for their collections. Narrator: A California collector pays $3.1 million for a painting said to be by Jackson Pollock. John Howard, who runs a billion dollar equity firm, purchases a Willem de Kooning for $4 million. In 2004, Domenico de Sole, a chairman of Tom Ford and Sotheby's, buys a purported Rothko for $8.3 million. Next, while Rosales and her gallery clients are celebrating their lucrative alliance and million-dollar sales... eyes are on another painting that's popped up on the market... I had certain kind of, in my gut, misgivings about it. I can't believe it. That we're playing “four on four” with a barbershop quartet? [QUARTET SINGING] Bum bum bum bum... pass the ball... pass the rock.. ...we're open just pass the ball! No, I can't believe how easy it was to save hundreds of dollars on my car insurance with GEICO. Yea. [QUARTET SINGING] Shoot the J! Shoot, shoot, shoot the jaaaaaay... <i> Believe it! GEICO could save</i> <i> you fifteen percent</i> <i> or more on car insurance.</i> <i> Believe it!

For works by major artists to come up on the market, it's extremely rare. But for multiple works by the same artist to come out of the same collection is very, very unusual. Narrator: The alliance between the little-known Rosales and a prestigious gallery like Knoedler might seem strange, too. But it appears to be kismet. Rosales just built, slowly, this relationship of trust. She would talk to Ann about her daughter's musical talent. She would talk with her every single birthday. This was the sort of thing that really made Ann Freedman trust Glafira Rosales. Narrator: While Rosales is the supplier, Ann Freedman is the face that makes the sales. Meridith Savona was formerly with the FBI's art crimes unit. She offers an analogy of Knoedler's prestige. If I buy a diamond from Tiffany's, I'm not going to then take it to find out if it's authentic. I bought it from Tiffany's. If I buy a painting from Knoedler Gallery, I have to assume it's an authentic painting. It had that same kind of reputation. Hernandez: Often, there'll be experts who in their heart of hearts think that a painting is fake, but they'll never express it. And part of that is due to the politeness of the art business, but really it's also driven by the fear of being sued. Narrator: So in January 2007, art historian Jack Flam is at odds when a Robert Motherwell painting pops up at Julian Weissman's, another New York art broker. We had no record of it, and this is always very exciting, to see a new painting. The Spanish Elegy reminds him of the Motherwell he saw in Freedman's office before... But there's something strange in the details. I had certain kind of, in my gut, misgivings about it. It was by then 50 years old or more -
- and although it was warped the front of it, the paint was not warped or cracked, which looked odd. Narrator: He holds his tongue, despite his misgivings. Flam: You're always advised not to police the market. It's not your job. But, nonetheless, you want to protect your artist legacy. Narrator: As it happens, Flam is also president of the Dedalus Foundation, founded by Robert Motherwell. Dedalus is in the midst of compiling a catalogue raisonné on Motherwell. A catalogue raisonné is a gathering of all the works by an artist. By common usage, it becomes the standard for establishing what are the authentic works by the artist and what is their authentic history. Narrator: During the process, researchers track down every known work by Motherwell. They enter it into their database and assign it an ID number. And you see the difference in the late '58. I still kept that sense of spontaneity. While studying seven paintings attributed to Motherwell's Spanish Elegy series, they notice a striking anomaly. My team showed me digital images on the fronts and the backs of the Spanish Elegies. And there were six from 1953, and this new one was 1955. When we saw the back of this one, we saw that it was signed very much the way the others were. For example, Robert Motherwell, and then underneath it the date, 1955. And then on a painting that was supposed to have been done three years earlier, in 1953, once again, Spanish Elegy in quotation marks and full caps on the top, almost exactly the same printing, and the date in the same place. Narrator: But Motherwell's signature is known to be inconsistent. Flam: Motherwell, in particular, signed pictures in different ways, in different months. So, this was a real tell. This really made us suspicious. Narrator: Another tell has to do with the two words -
- Spanish Elegy. Flam: Now, this is something that Motherwell himself often said, My Spanish Elegy paintings. Or That's a Spanish Elegy. But he did not put that on the backs of the paintings. And this is especially significant because those paintings that we were beginning to suspect were fakes had the title Spanish Elegy on them. Narrator: Another tell, and the perhaps most damning in Flam's mind, has to do with technique. As you look at the crispness and the intensity with which the real paint is painted, and you look at this, which is all kind of muffled and soft around the edges. Motherwell was very proud of and very careful about is the way in which he used variations of edge. So, you get very sharp edges, very soft edges. So, that kind of variation is something very important to him, but the, something that the forger misses entirely. Narrator: Their findings leave no doubt to Flam that the elegies are fake. For Dedalus, it just begs the question, Where did these pictures come from? And going through the database, we found that none of these pictures had a provenance that went back before 1999. First owner for four of them Ann Freedman, Knoedler Gallery. Other three, Julian Weissman. This is more than bizarre. You got seven paintings. Four of them come from one gallery and they were almost like one from one gallery, the next year, one from the other, one from one, one from the other. Up next, more questions arise about Rosales' elusive collector, Mr. X. Flam: I had come to suspect that Mr. X did not exist. Every aspect of the story behind those paintings was a red flag. Sweat. Dedication. Cupcakes. I'm Michael Griffin. I'm Brian Orakpo. We played football together for the Titans. Now, we own a cupcake shop. We bake, we decorate. I love this new Surface Pro. It's light, it's sleek, it's fast. I'm able to draw what color frosting we want. We do a lot with social media. We have funny videos that we do in the bakery.

Hit and Drone. Seen it, covered it. We know a thing or two because we've seen a thing or two. [Music] We are Farmers. Bum-pa-dum, bum-bum-bum-bum [Music] The art market can be secretive. Sometimes super-rich buyers and sellers opt for discretion -
- sellers like Glafira Rosales. Nikas: Glafira wasn't ostentatious. She didn't have flashy clothes. She didn't have an extraordinary mansion that $30 million can buy. She had a nice home on Long Island. She had a nice authentic collection of art and she lived a good life. But brokering art for her anonymous client, Mr. X, has put plenty of money in her pocket. The most lucrative sale comes in November 2007, when hedgefund billionaire, Pierre Lagrange, buys a Jackson Pollock painting from Knoedler for $17 million. Hernandez: So over the course of 15 years, Glafira Rosales was able to take 63 paintings, get $33 million out of them, and then the galleries sold them for $81 million. Narrator: At this point, Jack Flam and researchers from the Dedalus Foundation appeared to be the only skeptics. In fact, Flam finds the story of Mr. X astounding. Flam: And you know, this sounded like a classic, you know, These paintings were given to my aunt by her lover. And you know, Nobody was supposed to know about the lover, and now the lover's dead and she wants to sell the paintings. I mean, this is a classic story for fronting fake paintings. Narrator: He lays out his suspicions to Ann freedman, the director of Knoedler Gallery. My expectation was that she would be grateful because we're alerting her to a possible fraud, and therefore, she could take action. She could go back to the person she was getting them from and say, Hey, what's the story? And instead, she started arguing with us. Narrator: While Ann Freedman declined to speak with American Greed, Lawyer Luke Nikas defended her in later civil cases. Nikas: Ann Freedman believed in these works as she spent the better part of 14 years doing diligence in them, hiring experts to research them. And she really believed in them. So, this was very disturbing. We had no doubt that the paintings were wrong, that Ann was being hoodwinked by someone. Narrator: In December 2008, Dedalus refuses to enter the newly discovered works in their catalogue raisonné. Flam: The vast majority of people who own works by an artist, they want it to be in the catalogue raisonné, because this is a sign of authenticity. Narrator: To mitigate their concerns, Knoedler agrees to submit the Spanish Elegy to forensic testing. They run an arsenal of tests, including infrared spectroscopy, to help determine whether or not certain materials are present in a painting. The results... There was paint that was found that didn't exist at the time of some of these artists. Narrator: In particular, the presence of acrylic polymer emulsion paints. But Robert Motherwell did not begin using this kind of paint until the 1960s. Based on the findings, the Dedalus Foundation refuses to stand by any of the seven Motherwell elegies. As rumors ripple though the art scene, more collectors are eyeing their paintings. Everyone who knew this body of work, whether they thought the paintings were real or whether they thought the paintings were fakes, all said the same thing, If one of them is fake, they're all fake. Narrator: Flam makes the decision to quietly contact the FBI. Jack Flam is probably the hero of this story, because the FBI was involved early on. But he kept it very quiet, and other people who knew what was going on kept it very quiet, which is the way that we can do our investigations. Narrator: Next on American Greed, what will it take to stop a fraud? Savona: From the time the painting was created to where it walked through Knoedler, there was nothing but gaps. There was no paperwork. There was no trail. There was no records. Want inside information from the show? Join the Greed social network. Like us on American Greed's Facebook page.

Narrator: By 2009, Glafira Rosales is enjoying a long and lucrative run as the supplier of coveted masterpieces. The market got hotter and hotter, and it was something that Glafira Rosales was able to take advantage of. Narrator: She's the biggest blessing the art market has seen in decades. But the gravy train is about to derail. So it turned out that I was not the only person who thought that paintings that were coming through Knoedler and Julian Weissman were fake. But people weren't talking to each other. Narrator: British billionaire Pierre Lagrange who bought a $17 million Jackson Pollock from Knoedler in 2007 is ready to let it go. But suddenly, he's having trouble unloading it... He tried to sell it at one of the big auction houses, and they refused to sell it. And because of Jack Flam's tip, the FBI art crimes unit is now curious about the slew of paintings attributed to the same elusive provenance. We had to go down every avenue to find the negative, to find that Mr. X. did not exist, to find that the client did not exist. Narrator: When former assistant U.S. attorney Jason Hernandez joins the case, his first objective is clear. To get a criminal prosecution for fraud, you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone intended to commit a fraud and that's the highest burden in our law. Narrator: Rosales may be the likeliest suspect, but it's not that simple. Hernandez: You want to try and figure out some link to an artist, to a manufacturing facility, to purchases that are suspicious. Anything that would give us a clue as to who's making the paintings and where they're coming from. Narrator: But every lead fizzles. He decides to dig at it from another angle -
- the Internal Revenue Service. Savona: I had never worked with the IRS before, and I thought, Oh, man, now, this is going to take forever. And it didn't. Enter IRS Special Agent Eric Jonke to follow the money. It's hard to walk away from bank statements, wire transfers, and payments. Narrator: Between 2006 and 2011, Rosales asked the galleries to deposit her payments to two Spanish bank accounts -
- BBVA and CAJA Madrid. During the three years of the investigation that we took into consideration, she received over $14 million from prominent New York City galleries for the work -
- works of art that she was selling. Narrator: And central to Rosales' story is that she's an art broker for her Spanish client. If that's true, she would pay 90% to her mysterious client and collect a standard fee of 10%. She says she's representing somebody. Well, it's obviously got to go back to somebody. And if it's not going back to the person she claims to be representing... then there is nobody she's representing. Jonke: The biggest red flag was her sending the money directly overseas after selling the pieces of artwork. The nail in the coffin was that she wasn't paying any clients. Narrator: In particular, Glafira Rosales' mysterious client, Mr. X. What that told us was, that her story was false. There is no family in Europe that owns these paintings. These are paintings that are almost certainly fake and that she's pulling off a scam and keeping the money in foreign bank accounts. The bank accounts link to two new suspects -
- her long-time boyfriend, Carlos Bergantiños Diaz, and his brother Jesus. While it strengthens the fraud case, it also breaks another case wide open -
- tax evasion. During 2006-2008, we saw her receive a ton of money and majority of it sent overseas. So we were able to look at that and see how much she reported on her tax returns. She was reporting just over $2 million received for those three years, when in fact, she was receiving over $14 million. She was reporting peanuts on her tax returns. So from there, she's understating her income, lying on her tax returns, and she's also hiding the Spanish bank accounts overseas. Narrator: In May 2013, Glafira Rosales is charged and held for tax fraud and money laundering. If convicted of all counts, she's looking at up to 34 years in prison. In the ensuing weeks, Pierre Lagrange sends Knoedler an expert's report that the Jackson Pollock painting he purchased for $17 million is yet another fake. One day later, the long-esteemed gallery closes its doors. Hernandez: Over 60 of these paintings spanning multiple artists. But it was really only towards the end of the scheme that the full picture was really brought to bear. Narrator: Up next, Glafira Rosales reveals the shocking source behind the scheme that duped the art world for millions.

Essilor Narrator: In 2013, Glafira Rosales' astonishing 15-year art scam appears to be over. She got so enamored of what she was doing and thought that she was so good at it that she would absolutely never get caught. Narrator: But now if Rosales is convicted on tax and wire fraud charges, she faces more than three decades behind bars. The magistrate judge denied her bail. And her being detained, held without bail, probably caused her to think real hard about what her options were in this case. Glafira Rosales admits to passing off fake paintings as real, with the help of her boyfriend, Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz, and his brother, Jesus. Hernandez: One of the things that makes a fraud like this successful is a good false provenance. And the Bergantiños Diaz brothers were adept at that. They would conduct research in the historical record, in books, anything they could find so that when the paintings were passed off it was believable. Narrator: Glafira also names the artist forger, an elderly Chinese immigrant in Queens named Pei-Shen Qian. For 15 years, Pei-Shen Qian became Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, and any a number of artists. Narrator: In the 1970s, Qian used to paint portraits of Chairman Mao for schools and factories before immigrating to the United States. He didn't have much luck as a serious artist in the U.S. and resorted to hustling portraits on the sidewalks of Manhattan. This is someone who Jose Bergantiños Diaz and Glafira Rosales found just painting in New York City one day, and they challenged him. They explained how buyers are simply looking for works in the manner of Abstract Expressionist masters. They asked him to paint in the style of Rothko or Pollock to see if he could do it. And not only could he do it. He could do it well. Narrator: For the next 15 years, in his modest studio in Queens, Pei-Shen Qian creates dozens of look-alikes. This is a painting created by Pei-Shen Qian, the forger. It's a painting that's supposed to look like Mark Rothko. It had the right color scheme, had the right style for a Mark Rothko. You can see if you get close, you can see some of the brush strokes -
- all consistent with the way Rothko painted. Narrator: But it takes more than technique to fool savvy dealers. According to Rosales, that's where Jose stepped in to add his expertise. Hernandez: You needed older canvas for a painting that's supposed to be 60 years old. So, they would go to flea markets and look for paintings that were the right age and frames that were of the right age. Narrator: Once Pei-Shen finished a painting, Bergantiños added another touch of age. Hernandez: He would do things like empty the vacuum cleaner dustbin into the paintings so that dust and dirt would get into the crevices of the painting as you would expect to find in an older painting. And he would stain the canvases with tea bags and do other things to them to give them the appearance of age. Narrator: Lastly, Bergantiños forges a signature. You can see, it's white paint that he used to paint the actual words, but when you get close, you can see a brown tint to it, and it looks old to the naked eye. But when you actually test it, the brown is not from grime or age. It's, like, a varnish on top to make the white not so brilliant. Narrator: But in some cases, the red flags where remarkably apparent. Like, if anyone had bothered to look closer at this Pollock that hung on Ann Freedman's wall for decades. The signature for this work is down here, in the lower right corner. You can see the forger didn't spell Pollock correctly. It appears that he left out a C. Narrator: Investigators aren't sure whether Pei-Shen Qian is on to the scam from the beginning, but it's clear he eventually caught on. As a matter of fact, there came a time where he learned how much the paintings were being sold for, and he negotiated a raise. IRS agent Eric Jonke determines that Pei-Shen Qian gets paid a few thousand dollars each for his imitations of top Abstract Expressionists. Jonke: Mr. Bergantiños was paying him $3,000 to $8,000 per painting, which is peanuts compared to what Miss Rosales was initially selling them for. She's selling them for hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Narrator: In September 2013, Glafira Rosales pleads guilty in court to wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. By the time Glafira confesses, Pei-Shen Qian has fled back to China. If fame and fortune was what he was hoping for, then perhaps he is a success. Nikas: His works were in prominent museums. They sold for tens of millions of dollars in the aggregate. He was a famous artist, but not for who he was, but who he was pretending to be. Narrator: Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz and his brother have taken refuge in Spain. In 2016, Spanish courts rule against extraditing 60-year-old Diaz. He and his brother still face charges in the U.S. Here in the States, Glafira Rosales is left holding the bag. She got nine months of home detention, and she's got some supervised released time and she got restitution and forfeiture to the tune of about $81 million. Narrator: In her defense, attorneys argued that Glafira's boyfriend put her up to the scheme. He was the one who had found the art forger, who then supplied Glafira Rosales with the paintings. A string of civil cases have been filed against Knoedler & Company, art dealers Ann Freedman and Julian Weissman, and others taken in by Rosales. No criminal charges were filed against<i> them.</i> This is so egregious that there are people who will go to their grave saying, Ann Freedman knew. The Knoedler Gallery knew. Julian Weissman knew. How could they not know? Because they themselves have never been on that end, and they don't realize what it means to be the victim of a con artist. Nikas: Glafira Rosales really embedded herself in the art world in a careful way that allowed Knoedler Gallery to look at the situation and say, This is convincing to us. Narrator: Julian Weissman declined to comment for American Greed. To date, most of the lawsuits have been settled out of court. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing. Art and jewelry are the last sort of bastions
