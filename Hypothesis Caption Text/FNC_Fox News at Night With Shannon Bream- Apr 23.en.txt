 TIME FOR THE LAST BITE.
 DURING TODAY'S WHITE HOUSE
 EASTER APRIL DONALD TRUMP HAD A
 SURPRISING CONVERSATION WHILE
 HELPING KIDS COLOR CARDS.
 A YOUNG GUY SAID HE IS BUILDING
 THAT WALL.
 DO YOU BE LEAVE HIM?
 VERY CONSERVATIVE.
 SOUNDS LIKE HE IS A
 CONSERVATIVE.
 I AM JASON CHAFFETZ IN FOR LAURA
 INGRAM.
 SHANNON, TAKE IT FROM HERE.
 SHANNON: WE BEGIN WITH A FOX
 NEWS ALERT.
 DEMOCRATS UPPING THE ANTE,
 ANOTHER SUBPOENA AND FACING
 TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR
 SEEMING UNWILLINGNESS TO
 INVESTIGATE THE STEEL DOSSIER
 WHICH THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS IS
 FULL OF FALSE CLAIMS FRONTED BY
 HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DNC.
 THE FIRST PRIMARY, BERNIE
 SURGING IN THE POLLS AND SAYS
 EVEN THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER
 SHOULD GET THE VOTE FROM JAIL.
 WE WAIT TO SEE IF JOE BIDEN
 MAKES IT OFFICIAL THIS WEEK, WE
 TALKED WHEN ACCUSER WHO SAYS THE
 CONVERSATION SHE TRIED TO START
 COULD BE DERAILED.
 AND CHRISTIANS ATTACK ON THE
 HOLIEST DAY IN SRI LANKA BY
 RADICAL MUSLIMS AND MULTIPLE
 REPORTS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS NEW
 OF THE POTENTIAL FOR THE TERROR
 ATTACK WEEKS AGO.
 SOME IN POWER STILL UNWILLING TO
 CONNECT THE ATTACKS TO THEIR
 CHRISTIAN FAITH IN.
 I AM SHANNON BREAM IN
 WASHINGTON.
 LET'S GO TO ALRBER WHO
 HAS MORE ON THE GROWING
 CRITICISM OF THE STEEL DOSSIER
 IN THE WEEK OF THE REPORT AND
 DEMOCRATS GOING FOR IMPEACHMENT.
 WE MONITOR WHAT HAPPENED AFTER A
 CONFERENCE CALL.
 172 DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS
 PARTICIPATE IN A CONFERENCE
 CALL, IT REPORTEDLY WENT ON FOR
 90 MINUTES.
 THE CALL WAS SPIRITED BUT THERE
 WERE NO PLANS TO MOVE FORWARD
 WITH IMPEACHMENT EVEN THOUGH
 SOME PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS OF
 CALLED FOR IT.
 HERE IS HOW ONE DEMOCRAT
 DESCRIBED THE CALL.
 WE ARE NOT RUSHING TO
 ANYTHING BUT WE KNOW THERE WERE
 TROUBLESOME FINDINGS IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT AND IT IS OUR JOB
 TOññ■■■■■■■ SAID WHILE DEMOCRAT
 FIRMLY AGREE WE SHOULD PROCEED
 DOWN THE PATH OF FINDING THE
 TRUTH IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE
 FACTS REGARDING HOLDING THE
 PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE CAN BE
 GAINED OUTSIDE OF IMPEACHMENT
 HEARINGS.
 SOURCES SAY THAT IS WHAT SHE
 REITERATED IN TONIGHT'S COLIN
 HAS NOT RULED OUT THE
 POSSIBILITY OF IMPEACHMENT.
 NANCY PELOSI TOLD HER COLLEAGUES
 THIS ISN'T ABOUT DEMOCRATS OR
 REPUBLICANS BUT SAVING OUR
 DEMOCRACY.
 IF THAT IS WHERE THE FACTS TAKE
 US THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE TO GO.
 OTHER TOP DEMOCRATS WALKING A
 SIMILAR LINE, NOT READY TO BEGIN
 IMPEACHMENT MEETINGS WILL NOT
 RULE IT OUT.
 SOME LIKE JERRY NADLER SAY OTHER
 THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN FIRST.
 WE NEED TO HEAR FROM BAR, WE
 NEED TO HEAR FROM MUELLER, WE
 NEED THE ENTIRE REPORT IN ORDER
 TO MAKE DECISIONS.
 Reporter: THEY TRY TO FORCE
 THEM TO PULL OVER THE ENTIRE
 REPORT, ANNOUNCED ANOTHER
 SUBPOENA, DON MCGANN, THE
 CHAIRMAN IS ASKING FOR MORE
 DOCUMENTS AND PUBLIC TESTIMONY
 ON MAY 21ST.
 WHEN IT COMES TO IMPEACHMENT
 REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
 EASTER EGG ROLL ASKED DONALD
 TRUMP IF HE'S WORRIED ABOUT IT,
 SHANNON: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 AS DEMOCRATS FRET OVER HOW
 IMPEACHMENT COULD IMPACT VOTER
 SUPPORT, CANDIDATES APPEARED
 DIVIDED AS THEY TRY TO GAUGE HOW
 INDEPENDENTS ARE FEELING ABOUT
 THE I WORD.
 KRISTIN FISHER JOINS US FROM
 MANCHESTER.
 Reporter: 5 DEMOCRATIC
 CONTENDERS HAVE BEEN FACING OFF
 IN BACK TO BACK TOWNHALLS ON
 CNN.
 ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN ASKED
 ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AND ELIZABETH
 MORAN SAYS SHE IS FOR IT BUT
 LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO, SENATOR
 KAMALA HARRIS JOINING HER BY
 SAYING THIS.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD
 TAKE A STEP TOWARD IMPEACHMENT.
 WARREN HAD CHALLENGED HER
 COLLEAGUES TO TAKE A STAND ON
 THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS DETAILED
 IN THE MUELLER REPORT AND VOTE.
 IF THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE
 HOUSE OR THE SENATE WHO WANT TO
 SAY THAT IS WHAT A PRESIDENT CAN
 DO WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS BEING
 INVESTIGATED FOR HIS OWN
 WRONGDOING OR A FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENT TO TAX OUR COUNTRY
 THE NATION HAS TO TAKE THAT A
 VOTE AND LIVE WITH IT FOR THE
 REST OF THEIR LIVES.
 MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG'S
 TOWNHALL IS STILL GOING ON BUT
 THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES WERE
 PRETTY NONCOMMITTAL WHEN IT CAME
 TO THE IMPEACHMENT QUESTION.
 I'M NOT GOING TO PREDISPOSE
 THINGS, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT
 IS OR ISN'T BUT THERE ARE VERY
 DISTURBING THINGS THAT WOULD
 LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THERE IS
 INSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 OF THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF
 GOING INTO THE ELECTION ALL
 CONGRESS IS TALKING ABOUT IS
 IMPEACHING TRUMP AND TRUMP TRUMP
 TRUMP AND MUELLER MUELLER
 MUELLER AND WE ARE NOT TALKING
 ABOUT HEALTHCARE OR RAISING THE
 MINIMUM WAGE TO A LIVING WAGE,
 WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT WORKS
 TO TRUMP'S ADVANTAGE.
 Reporter: ACCORDING TO A NEW
 POLL BY THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW
 HAMPSHIRE SANDERS IS LEADING THE
 PACK IN THE FIRST PRIMARY STATE.
 JOE BIDEN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE
 ENTERING THE RACE IS 12 POINTS
 BEHIND HIM AND THE RELATIVE
 UNKNOWN TURNED RISING STAR PETER
 BUTTIGIEG 3 POINTS BEHIND THE
 FORMER VP.
 EVERYONE ELSE'S IN SINGLE DIGITS
 AND PEOPLE LOOK AT THE
 REPUBLICAN FOOD AND NOT
 SURPRISINGLY DONALD TRUMP IS
 LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF EVERYBODY
 ELSE.
 ONLY BILL WELLS HAS OFFICIALLY
 ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CHALLENGE HIM
 BUT THAT COULD CHANGE.

 INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING HAS
 PLENTY MORE TO SAY ABOUT HIS
 ANTICIPATED CANDIDACY.
 SHE JOINS US TONIGHT, WELCOME.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 SHANNON: I KNOW YOU WROTE DAYS
 AGO ABOUT WHERE THIS
 CONVERSATION WENT BECAUSE SOME
 PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY REACTED
 SAYING SHE IS NOT CLAIMING
 SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL
 HARASSMENT AND ON THE OTHER
 SIDE, HE IS A SERIAL HUGGER.

 SHANNON: SOMETHING ON
 CONVERSATION.COM THAT
 ENCAPSULATES THIS CONVERSATION.
 BIDEN'S ALLEGED CREEPINESS WAS A
 TEST FOR ME TOO, IT PRESSES US
 TO CONSIDER HOW WIDE WE WANT TO
 CAST THE SAME NET.

 I'M NOT OUT THERE TRYING TO SAY
 WE CAN'T GIVE FRIENDLY HUGS
 ANYMORE AND WE CAN TOUCH ONE
 ANOTHER WHEN TAKING PICTURES, OF
 COURSE WE CAN.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING
 ABOUT.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AS WOMEN WE
 HAVE HAD TO INDOOR THIS KIND OF
 INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR ON BEHALF
 OF POWERFUL MEN FOR AS LONG AS I
 HAVE BEEN ALIVE BUT FOREVER AND
 WE HAVE GOTTEN TO THIS POINT
 N SPEAK OUT
 Y NO.
 MAYB W
 AUDN'T FEEL

 SHANNON: YOU TORS
                   AND THERE ARE MANY CRITICS.OUT THAT
 YOU WERE A SUPPORTER BERNIE
 SANDERS IN 2016, THEY QUESTION
 YOUR POLITICAL MOTIVATION.
 I WANT YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT.
 IT IS ENTIRELY INAPPLICABLE.
 THE REASON WHY WOMEN END UP
 TALKING ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES
 WITH POWERFUL MEN BEFORE THEY
 ARE ABOUT TO BE CONFIRMED FOR
 SOMETHING IS BECAUSE THAT IS
 WHEN THE CONVERSATION BECOMES
 WIDESPREAD.
 THAT IS WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
 AND START TO FIT THESE PEOPLE
 FOR THE THI ARE TRYING
 TO DO.
 OBVIOUSLY IT IS APPLICABLE HERE
 BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE THIS
 CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS HISTORY.
 WHAT YOU VOTE FOR HIM AS A
 CANDIDATE?
 I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES THAT
 IN THE PRIMARY I WILL NOT BE
 VOTING FOR HIM, I WILL NOT
 SUPPORT HIM.
 I HAVE MANY PROBLEMS BESIDES
 THIS WITH SOME OF THE POSITIONS
 HE HAS TAKEN IN THEA■
                       PAST BUT TO MAKE THEIR ISION.I KNEW THIS
 ASPECT OF HIS HISTORY THAT
 NEEDED TO BE DISCUSSED BECAUSE
 CONVERSATIWITH THIS  LIKE FOR N
 AND WE WILL SEE WHERE IT GOEERE.
 THANK YOU.
 ANOTHER FORT, THE
 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT IS
 NG THE HAMMER ON IRAN'S
 ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE
 STARTING WITH THEIR BIG OIL
 EXPORTS, TRACE GALLAGHER HAS
 MORE.
 THE WHITE HOUSE LONG SAID
 IRAN'S NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES ARE
 DESTABILIZING SECURITY AND THE
 US CAN LIMIT IRAN'S OIL EXPORTS
 AND CUT OUT A MAJOR SOURCE OF
 FUNDING AND CUT DOWN ON THE
 VARIOUS ACTIVITIES SO THE
 ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT RENEW
 WAIVERS THAT ALLOWED EIGHT
 COUNTRIES TO KEEP BUYING IRANIAN
 CRUDE INCLUDING CHINA, TURKEY
 AND INDIA, IRAN'S BIGGEST
 CUSTOMER.
 WE ARE GOING TO 0 ACROSS THE
 BOARD.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE
 SANCTIONS AND MONITOR
 COMPLIANCE.
 ANY ENTITY INTERACTING WITH THE
 RANCH INTRODUCED DILIGENCE AND
 AIR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION.
 Reporter: EVEN THOUGH MIKE
 POMPEO SAID THE US IS GOING TO 0
 HE ALSO WOULD NOT RULE OUT THE
 POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED
 EXCEPTIONS.
 SINUSES IT OPPOSES US SANCTIONS
 AND TURKEY CALLS THEM ILLEGAL.
 POLITICALLY IT IS NOT RIGHT,
 ETHICALLY IT IS NOT RIGHT.
 IN TERMS OF COMMERCE IT IS
 DEFINITELY NOT RIGHT AND IS ALSO
 AGAINST INTERNATIONAL LAW OF
 COMMERCE.
 SOME BELIEVE LIMITING IRANIAN
 EXPORTS COULD LEAD TO A SUPPLY
 SHORTAGE AND PRICE INCREASE.
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT
 VENEZUELAN IT OIL EXPORTS HAVE
 BEEN TARGETED AND
                   LIBYA, ALSO MAJOR EXPORTER, A BARREL OF OIL
 IS NOW ABOVE $74, THE HIGHEST
 PRICE IN 6 MONTHS AND AAA SAYS
 CALIFORNIA GAS PRICES ARE THE
 HIGHEST IN 5 YEARS THOUGH THAT
 HAS A LOT MORE TO DO WITH STATE
 POLITICS AND SANCTIONS AND IRAN
 WILL CERTAINLY BE A CORE -KEY
 FOREIGN POLICIES ON THE 2020
 CAMPAIGN.

 ANOTHER EXPLOSION ROCKING THE CAPITAL AFTER COORDINATED LAST
 KILLED 290.■@
 MONDAY'S EXPLOSION CAME AS POLI
 VAN.
 TWO PAK CHURCHES WERE TARGETED
 EASTER SUNDAY LEAVING
 BLOODSOAKED PEWS BUT SAINT
 ANTHONY'S WHICH SUMMITS OF THE
 CARNAGE FROZE AT THE TIME OF THE
 ATTACK.
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS
 OFFERED ASSISTANCE.
 I SPOKE WITH THE PRIME
 MINISTER AND VARIOUS GOVERNMENT
 OFFICIALS AND WE ARE WORKING
 WITH SRI LANKA BUT THAT IS A
 TERRIBLE THING.
 TOURISTS WERE TARGETS, 31
 FOREIGNERS DIED INCLUDING
 SEVERAL AMERICANS INCLUDING A
 FIFTH-GRADER FROM DC.
 THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT BY
 7 SUICIDE BOMBERS, LITTLE-KNOWN
 GROUP.
 SOON AFTER THE ATTACK POLICE
 CARRIED OUT RAIDS ACROSS THE
 CAPITAL.
 OFFICIALS BELIEVE THE GROUP WAS
 HELPED BY AND PERHAPS FUNDED BY
 AN INTERNATIONAL TERROR NETWORK.
 THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
 RECEIVED A TIP OFTEN BEGIN AGO
 FROM INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES, THE
 SUICIDE BOMBER AT LATEST ATTACK.
 CHRISTIAN AND CATHOLIC

 THE US IS ISSUED A TRAVEL
 ADVISORY WARNING THAT THERE

 REPORTEDLY RISEN TO 311.
 WHAT ABOUT THOSE EARLY WARNINGS.
 LET'S BRING IN THE OP-ED EDITOR
 FROM THE YOUR POST AND BOB
 SEXTON.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
 READING SOMETHING FROM THE NEW
 YORK TIMES, SRI LANKA WAS WARNED
 OF POSSIBLE TAX, WHY DIDN'T IT
 STOP THEM?
 CONFIDENTIAL SECURITY MEMO LAID
 IT ALL OUT, NAMES, ADDRESSES,
 PHONE NUMBERS, THEY KNEW AS FAR
 BACK AS JANUARY, THEY STOCKPILED
 WEAPONS AND THAT IS NOT ALL.
 HOW DOES THIS FAILURE HAPPEN?
 A MASSIVE INTELLIGENCE
 FAILURE.
 THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
 FINGER-POINTING AND THEY HAVE TO
 DO ALL EFFORT TO FIGURE OUT WHY
 THEY WOULD MESS SOMETHING UP
 LIKE THIS WHEN THERE WERE A LOT
 OF DETAILS BUT IT MIGHT BE
 BECAUSE THE INTELLIGENCE
 SERVICESi7■7■7 HAVEN'T BEEN LOOT
 JIHADISTSS, THAT HASN'T BEEN A
 THREAT.
 THIS IS Y THAT UNTIL A
 DECADE AGO WAS IN THE MIDST OF A
 MULTI-DECADE-LONG CIVIL WAR BUT
  PRIMARILY NATIONALIST IN
 NATURE BETWEEN BUDDHIST AND
 HINDUS.
 THEY HAVEN'T HAD THIS JIHADIST
 PROBLEM.
 WHEN THAT INFORMATION CAME IN,
 IT IS POSSIBLE THEY COULD MISS
 SOMETHING WHERE THE ROADMAP WAS
 SO DRAWN OUT, SOUNDS LIKE THEY
 HAD CLEAR THREAT WARNING.
 THEY ASSUMED IT MUST BE A THREAT
 THAT IS EXAGGERATED BECAUSE THEY
 HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THIS IN THE
 PAST.
 IT HASN'T HAD ITS FAIR SHARE OF
 JIHADIST TERROR ATTACKS.
 IT IS A QUESTION OF NOT BE
 LEAVING THE THREAT WAS ACCURATE.
 HEATHER: YOU HAVE A LOT MORE
 INFORMATION, THIS IS A VERY
 METICULOUSLY TO HAVE THESE NEAR
 SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPLOSIONS AND
 HELP FROM A MORE SOPHISTICATED
 GROUP.
 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND
 EDITORIAL HEADLINE SAYS WORLD
 LEADERS ARE DENOUNCING THE
 ATTACK ON HUMANITY BUT MAKE NO
 MISTAKE THIS WAS AN ATTACK ON
 CHRISTIANS.
 THE BOMBS WENT OFF IN PLACES OF
 WORSHIP DURING SERVICES ON THE
 HOLIEST DAY OF THE CHRISTIAN
 CALENDAR.
 THE EDITORIAL IS ABSOLUTELY
 RIGHT.
 WE HAVE THIS IDEOLOGY OF RADICAL
 JIHADIST HIM IN VARIOUS
 GEIC PERMUTATIONS AND
 DIFFERENT STRANDS OF THE
 ORGANIZATION ARE ALL DIFFERENT
 BUT ONE THING THEY ALL SHARE IS
 A HATRED OF CHRISTIANS THAT LIVE
 IN THEIR MIDST, WHETHER IT BE IN
 NIGERIA OR THE RAVAGES THAT HAS
 BEEN ON CHRISTIAN VILLAGERS IN
 NIGERIA WHETHER IT WAS IN LIBYA
 OR EGYPT OR JORDAN AND ELSEWHERE
 THAT IS ONE COMMON THREAD AND WE
 HAVE TO CALL IT OUT.
 ALSO IT IS A REMINDER THAT THE
 ISLAMIC STATE LOST ITS
 TERRITORIAL HOLD ON THE LAFOND
 AND MESOPOTAMIA NEVERTHELESS THE
 IDEOLOGY REMAINS SO WHATEVER
 ISIS 2.0 IS TAKING SHAPE THIS
 MIGHT BE THE BEGINNING OF THAT.
 SHANNON: I WANT YOU TO COMMENT
 ON THE US LIFTING WAIVERS ON
 COUNTRIES THAT WANT TO BUY FROM
 IRAN.
 WE HAVE 5 REMAINING COUNTRIES IN
 THE SPOTLIGHT.
 CHINA COMES TO MIND IS ONE TO
 WATCH FOR, TURKEY, QUICK COMMENT
 ON HOW THIS WORKS OUT FOR IRAN
 IN THOSE COUNTRIES.
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
 TRYING TO PUT WHAT WE OBAMA
 ADMINISTRATION GOT WRONG, NO
 NEED TO SIGN A BAD DEAL AND GIVE
 THE IRANIAN'S A LOT OF LEEWAY
 PARTICULARLY ON THE FINANCIAL
 SIDE OF THE EQUATION THAT THEY,
 DID NOT EARN FROM REAL
 CONCESSIONS, THEY GOT US OUT OF
 THE DEAL AND SAY THEY ARE GOING
 TO TAKE IT FURTHER, CHANGE
 IRANIAN BEHAVIOR THAT IS
 SERIOUS, THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD
 BE DOING.
 I WOULD ADD IT IS AMAZING. T
 ME WE STILL TALK ABOUT THIS
 ADMINISTRATION IS SOMEHOW
 BEHOLDEN TO MOSCOW
 KREMLIN AND YET YOU HAVE ONE
 MORE EVIDENCE HERE OF THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION SQUEEZING
 RUSSIA'S MAIN MIDDLE EAST ALLY
 IRAN. T
 NOT BY ANY OF ITS POLICIES.
 SHANNON: THANK YOU BOTH.
 WHO COLLUDED WITH WHOM?
 DEMOCRATS GET THIS INFORMATION
 FROM THE RUSSIANS ON DONALD
 TRUMP AND ARE THEY WILLING TO
 DIG INTO THAT POSSIBILITY?
 THAT IS NEXT.

        I had no symptoms         of Hepatitis C.
             Mine...                 çX @ @■■■■■
     ...caused liver damage.
  EPCLUSA treats all main types        of chronic Hep C.
       Whatever your type,         ask your doctor
 if EPCLUSA is your kind of cure.
      I had the common type.
          Mine was rare.
        EPCLUSA has a 98%        overall cure rate.
         I just found out      about my hepatitis C.
        I knew for years.
       EPCLUSA is only one        pill, once a day,
      taken with or without        food for 12 weeks.
     Before starting EPCLUSA,         your doctor will
       test if you have had hepatitis B, which may flare up
         and could cause      serious liver problems
   during and after treatment.
     Tell your doctor if you       have had hepatitis B
          other liver or       kidney problems, HIV
  or other medical conditions...
  ...and all medicin takcluding .
        Taking amiodarone         with EPCLUSA may
     cause a serious slowing       of your heart rate.
   Common side effects include      headache and tiredness
    Ask your doctor today, if  EPCLUSA is your kind of cure.
 CALLS TO INATE THE ORIGINS OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 PROBE GETTING LOUDER FUELED BY
 THE FACT THE MUELLER REPORT
 FOUND SEVERAL ALLEGATIONS WERE
 COMPLETELY FALSE OR IMPOSSIBLE
 TO VERIFY.
 THE NEW YORK TIMES RIGHT NOW THE
 DOSSIER FINANCED BY HILLARY
 CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN AND
 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE
 AND COMPILED BY THE FORMER
 BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IS
 LIKELY TO FACE NEW SCRUTINY FRO■
 MULTIPLE INQUIRIES.
 FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY
 GENERAL HARRY LITTMAN AND JOHN
 YOU, WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU.
 A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
 THIS WEEKEND THE NEW YORK TIMES
 WRITING A LOT OF THIS DIDN'T PAN
 OUT, EITHER NOT TRUE, CAN'T
 PROVE IT AND NOW THEY SOUND LIKE
 CRITICS OF THE DOSSIER TWO YEARS
 IN.
 IF YOU READ THE FIRSME OF
 ND LOOK FOR
 COON OST
 BE MUELLERONCLUDED
 PRETTY WERE FALS
 G OR NOT WORTH
 LOOKING AT ARE FOLLOWING UP ON
 SO THE QUESTION IN MY MIND IS
 HOW WERE OUR INTELLIGENCE
 AGENCIES, WERE THEY NAÏVE AND
 GULLIBLE?
 SOMETHING THEY SO BADLY WANTED
 TO BELIEVE, THE TRUMP WAS
 WORKING FOR THE RUSSIANS THAT
 THEY PASSED IT ALONG TO THE FISA
 COURT TO GET WARRANTS WITHOUT
 SECOND GUESSING OR CHECKING IT
 OR IS SOMETHING MORNING FARIAS
 GOING ON?
 WERE PEOPLE IN THE
 ADMINISTRATION IN THE
 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WANTING TO
 STOP TRUMP, WHO WERE WORRIED
 ABOUT HIM SO THEY BOUGHT THE
 WHOLE THING HOOK, LINE AND
 SINKER TO USE IT FOR A BAD
 PURPOSE WHICH WAS SPYING ON
 ONGOING PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BY
 A MAJOR PARTY?
 A LOT OF FOLKS ARE ASKING
 QUESTIONS ON SUNDAY SHOWS AND
 TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS
 RUSSIA'S MOST BRILLIANT MOVE,
 SPREADING DISINFORMATION, CHRIS
 WALLACE, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE
 COMMITTEE, ADAM SCHIFF WAS ASKED
 IF HE WOULD BE WILLING TO
 INVESTIGATE THE DOSSIER ITSELF
 AS TO WHETHER IT WAS RUSSIAN
 THIS INFORMATION AND HERE'S HIS
 RESPONSE.
 THE MUELLER REPORT MAKES IT
 ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT
 THE INITIATION OF THIS
 INVESTIGATION WAS NOT ONLY
 WARRANTED BUT ABSOLUTELY
 NECESSARY BECAUSE IT REVEALED A
 WIDESPREAD SYSTEMIC EFFORT BY
 THE RUSSIANS TO HELP THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN.
 SHANNON: SHOULD DEMOCRATS BE
 WILLING TO SEE IF THAT INCLUDED
 SPREADING DISINFORMATION THROUGH
 THE DOSSIER?
 MAYBE.
 I KIND OF AGREE WITH JOHN.
 THERE WERE SOME SNIPPETS HE
 VERIFIED, OTHERS HE SAID WERE
 WRONG.
 ASSISTING WAS TWO THINGS, THE
 QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION WE
 GET, HOW WE KNOW IT IS THE BEST
 IS ONE THING BUT SECOND THE MOST

 THE ACTUALD BE EVIDENCE OF THAT SO AS TO THE
 SPYING POINT THAT THEY WERE
 DUPED ON PURPOSE I JUST DON'T
 THINK THERE IS ANY REASON TO
 THINK IT BUT IT IS FINE TO LOOK
 AND FIGURE OUT HOW IT IS THAT
 SOME OF THE INTELLIGENCE WAS NOT
 BORN OUT.
 SHANNON: I WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO
 COMMENT, NEW SUBPOENAS OF GONE
 OUT, THE NEWEST TO DON MCGANN
 AND THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN
 THE PARTISANSHIP, REPUBLICANS
 AND DEMOCRATS, OVER THIS.
 CONGRESSMAN COLLINS SAYS THIS.
 I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL UP ON HIS OFFER
 TO READ THE FULL REPORT.
 DISMISSING THIS OFFER AND
 REFUSING TO REVIEW THE REPORT
 YOU DEMANDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
 ANNOUNCED A DERELICTION OF DUTY.
 THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING
 ANOTHER SUBPOENA IN COURT SAYING
 HE WILL KEEP HIS FINANCIAL
 RECORDS FROM BEING TURNED OVER.
 THIS PUTS THE WHITE HOUSE IN
 A TOUGH LEGAL SPOT BUT NOT OF
 POLITICAL SPOT.
 LEGALLY THEY COULD CLAIM
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
 THE IDEA THE PRESIDENT'S
 COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE
 PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION SO
 HE CAN EFFECTIVELY PURSUE HIS
 RESPONSIBILITIES HAS BEEN
 RECOGNIZED BY COURT SINCE THE
 WATERGATE TAPES CASE AND
 PRACTICED FOR MANY■■■■■■■■ DECAS
 BEFORE THAT BUT POLITICALLY THE
 SMART THING WOULD BE FOR TRUMP
 W■■■XECUTIVE PRIVILEGE,
 LET DON MCGANN APPEAR IN■■■■
 ■■TELL T■■
 WE HAVE HISTORIC, MUELLE

 ALMOST NO REDACTIONS AROUND IT.■
 WHY NOMP POLITICALLY
 WOMART TO LET ALL■■■■ THE
 ■■ATION OUT BECAUSE MUELLER
 ALREADY HAS.
 WHVERYTHING PRIVILEG■■■■■■■■■■D?
 IT MAY BE THE WHITE HOUSE
 DOES.
 THE OTHER SUBPOENA THAT COMES
 FROM CONGRESSMAN CUMMINGS, THE
 CHAIRMAN, HE'S ASKING FOR
 TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS, FINAC
 PRESIDENT.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 THE LAWSUIT FROM FILED TODAY,
 HOW ANOMALOUST WAS HE SUED
 CUMMINGS PERSONALLY, SO THERE IS
 NO LEGITIMATE OVERSIGHT.
 IT IS IRONIC, HE CLAIMS IN THE
 PAST YOU CAN'T SECOND-GUESS ME,
 MY BROAD AREA OF AUTHORITY.
 THAT'S RIGHT FOR CONGRESS TOO.
 IT WILL BE HARD TO ASSERT AND I
 DON'T THINK IT WILL WIN, THE
 CONGRESS HAS NO LEGITIMATE
 OVERSIGHT PURPOSE IN LOOKING FOR
 THOSE RECORDS AND THAT'S THE WAY
 IT WINDS UP.O■■■■■
 HEATHER: THEY SAY IT IS ABOUT
 EXPOSING THE PREO USE IT
 AS A POLITICAL TOOL AGAINST HIM
 IN 2020.
 WE WILL SEE IF THE JUDGE BUYS
 THAT.
 THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH, GREAT
 TO HAVE YOU.

 VOTERS SAYING IT IS RIGHT TO
 IMPEACH TRUMP SO THAT IS WHAT IS
 HAPPENING.
 THE PROBLEM IS IT IS A
 DISASTROUS GENERAL ELECTION
 STRATEGY AS THE REPUBLICANS
 FOUND IN 1998 AFTER THE
 IMPEACHMENT OF BILL CLINTON SO
 MY ADVICE TO MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS
 pmROP THIS, MOVE ON, TALK
 ABOUT ISSUES AND FORGET
 IMPEACHMENT.
 SPEAKING OF ISSUES BERNIE
 SANDERS WAS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER
 OR NOT SOMEONE LIKE THE BOSTON
 MARATHON BOMBER SHOULD BE
 ALLOWED TO VOTE FROM JAIL.
 I THINK THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS
 INHERENT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
 YES, EVEN FOR TERRIBLE PEOPLE.
 ONCE YOU START CHIPPING AWAY
 YOUR RUNNING DOWN THE SLIPPERY
 SLOPE.
 SHANNON: I SEE YOU SHAKING YOUR
 HEAD.
 OFTENTIMES WE ARE LOOKING FOR
 EVIDENCE THAT A WAVE MIGHT BE
 FORMING IN FAVOR OF ONE PARTY OR
 ANOTHER PARTY.
 THIS IS THE KIND OF MATERIAL YOU
 START HEARING ABOUT WHERE YOU
 START TO SEE A LANDSLIDE
 FORMING.
 THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATS MANAGED TO
 DO SOMETHING LIKE LOSE ALL 50 y=
 STATES, COME UP WITH CRAZY IDEAS
 S IN THE PROBLEM FOR
 DEMOCRATS IS BERNIE SANDERS IS
 NOT SOME FRESHMAN IN THE HOUSE
 WHO JUST ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON
 AND IS POPPING OFF THE TOP OF
 HIS HEAD WITH CRAZY IDEAS.
 THIS IS THE GUY, THE ELDER
 STATESMAN, PEOPLG FOR
 THE NOMINATION, THE PERSON WHO
 PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON THE
 NOMINATION IN 2016 IF IT HADN'T
 BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AND HAS A
 GOOD SHOT AT BEING THE NOMINEE
 THIS TIME.
 CRAZY CRAZY IDEAS LIKE THIS ARE
 WHAT TURNS OFF ALL THE
 TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATES
 THEY USUALLY RELY ON.
 SHANNON: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
 UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
 POLL, NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS AND
 HERE'S HOW THEY RECORD, BERNIE
 AT 30%, SECOND BIDEN, 18% EVEN
 THOUGH HE'S NOT PARTICULARLY IN.
 PETE BUTTIGIEG, WHAT DOES IT SAY
 ABOUT THE FIELD?
 WHITE GUYS.TORY AND YET THREE
 BERNIE SANDERS WON NEW
 HAMPSHIRE IN 2016, THERE'S
 PROXIMITY TO HIS HOME STATE OF
 VERMONT.
 GOING BACK TO THE ABSURDITY OF
 WHAT SENATOR SANDERS IS SAYING
 HE GOES AND CRITICIZES THE
 SECOND AMEUITE OFTEN IT
 SAYS WE SHOULD INFRINGE ON THAT
 RIGHT.
 I'M NOT ABSOLU■2■2
 DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE
 WEAPON ICE ARTILLERY.
 YOU HAVE RESTRICTIONS.
 A COMMON SENSE RESTRICTION WOULD
 BESTS, SOMEONE CONVICTED
 OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND MURDER
 SHOULD■ ■  NOT BE ABTE IN
 THE ELECTIONS.
 THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING 99% OF
 ALL AMERICANS BELIEVE IN AND
 DOUG WEE, A GREAT WAY TO
 TURN PEOPLE OFF AND SENATOR
 SANDERS@ GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO
 AN EASY LAP ANSWER, I DON'T
 THINK TERRORISTS SHOULD HAVE TH=
 RIGHT TO VOTE, MOVE ON.
 THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT
 NOW THE PERSON IN FIRST PLACE IN
 NEW HAMPSHIRE THINK THE BOSTON
 BOMBER, 80 OR 90 MILES AWAY
 SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE IN
 ELECTIONS, THANK YOU DEMOCRATS,
 KEEP THE GIFT COMING IT STILL
 QUITE EARLY.
 SHANNON: IN THE NEW YORK TIMES,
 SHOULD A WHITE MAN BE THE FACE
 OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN 2020?
 IS THE BIGGER GAMBLE TO RISK A
 WHITE MAN AND DISAPPOINT THE
 BASE OR NOMINATE A MINORITY
 CANDIDATE A WOMAN WHO MIGHT
 STRUGGLE TO CARRY PREDOMINATELY
 WHITE SWING STATES LIKE
 WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN AND
 PENNSYLVANIA THAT BARACK OBAMA
 AND DONALD TRUMP WON?
 REACT TO THAT.
 WE SHOULD NOMINATE THE BEST
 PERSON.
 AFTER THE PRIMARY AND CAUCUS
 PROCESS, WE SHOULDN'T PLAY
 IDENTITY POLITICS ABOUT WHETHER
 THE NOMINATION IS A WHITE MALE
 OR BLACK WOMAN OR SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 THAT BEING SAID I'M ALL FOR
 DIVERSE CITY ON THE TICKET, THAT
 IS GREAT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE
 QUOTAS OR CHOOSE CANDIDATES
 BASED ON GENDER OR RACE IT IS
 DOOMED TO FAIL CONTRARY TO
 AMERICAN VALUES.
 THAT IS WHAT THE PARTIES
 ENCOMPASSING, THIS TICKET WILL
 BE DIFFERENT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 DOUG IS RIGHT.
 BY DEFINITION THOSE PEOPLE WHO
 VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA AND
 TURNED AROUND AND VOTED FOR
 DONALD TRUMP DON'T CARE ABOUT
 YOUR SKIN COLOR, THEY ARE
 LISTENING TO YOUR IDEAS, THAT'S
 ALL I CARE ABOUT.
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE THE
 ONLY PEOPLE LEFT ANYMORE TALKING
 ABOUT SKIN COLOR, GENDER AND ALL
 THIS WAS EVERYONE ELSE IS
 TALKING IDEAS SO UNTIL THEY STOP
 THAT NONSENSE AND GETS INTO
 TALKING ABOUT IDEAS THEY ARE
 NEVER GOING TO WIN OVER THOSE
 PEOPLE ESPECIALLY PLAYING
 IDENTITY POLITICS.
 SHANNON: FINAL WORD TO YOU.
 DOUG HIT IT ON THE HEAD.
 THIS REPRESENTS HOW DEMOCRAT
 PARTY USED TO BE, NOT HOW IT IS,
 THE FACE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 DEMANDS IDENTITY POLITICS AND
 THEY WILL HAVE A COMPETITION OF
 WHO CAN PLAY IDENTITY POLITICS
 THE BEST AND UNREASONABLY ATTACK
 JOE BIDEN AND BERNIE SANTOS OR
 SOMETHING THEY CANNOT CONTROL.
 IT SHOULD BE A BATTLE OF IDEAS,
 NOT SKIN COLOR AND THE DEMOCRAT
 PARTY, THE MAJORITY WILL FOCUS
 ON THAT AND CHARLIE MADE A DECK
 OF HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO VOTE
 FOR DONALD TRUMP WHEN PREVIOUSLY
 VOTING FOR BARACK OBAMA.
 SHANNON: LOOK AT THAT.
 IT IS A TRIFECTA, GREAT TO HAVE
 YOU.
 NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DIBLASIO

 OCASIO CORTEZ, EARLIER T

 HE SAYS TO TURN THE BIG APPLE
 INTO THE GREEN APPLE WHICH HE
 WANTS TO DO HE HAS BIG PLANS.
 WE ARE GOING TO BAN THE
 CLASSIC GLASS AND STEEL
 SKYSCRAPERS WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY
 INEF

 THEY CAN TAKE A LOT OF STEPS■ T
 MAKE IT ENERGY EFFICIENT BUT IT
 WILL NOT BE LIKE IN THE PA
 BILL DIBLASIO ANNOUNCING HIS
 OWN GREEN NEW DEAL ON EARTH
 THEY, CONSTRUCTING A BILL TO
 TARGET THOSE SKYSCRAPERS.
 THEY HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR
 CITY OR EARTH ANYMORE.
 IF A COMPANY WANTS TO BUILD A
 BIG SKYSCRAPER THEY CAN USE A
 LOT OF GLASS AND DO THE OTHER
 THINGS NEEDED TO REDUCE
 EMISSIONS.
 SPEAKING OF EMISSIONS THE
 MAYOR IS REALLY CRITICIZED FOR
 TRAVELING 11 MILES TO THE GYM IN
 AN SUV.
 WHAT ENVIRONMENTALLY
 RESPONSIBLE EXAMPLE ARE YOU
 SITTING THERE?
 IT IS PART OF MY LIFE.
 I COME FROM THAT PART OF
 OAKLAND, THAT IS MY HOME.
 I GO THERE ON A REGULAR BASIS.
 TO NOT BE IN THE BUBBLE FOR A
 LOT OF POLITICIANS IS A HUGE
 PROBLEM.
 BILL DIBLASIO SAYS THE SUV IS
 PART OF THE JOB.
 HE WANTED BUILDINGS ARE NOT UP
 BY 30% REDUCED EMISSION BY 2030
 THE OWNERS OF THOSE BUILDINGS
 COULD FACE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
 IN FINES WHICH HE WAS PRINCIPAL
  A PRESIDENTIAL
 ANNOUNCEMENT BUT SAYS HE'S
 TALKING ABOUT OVER WITH HIS
 FAMILY.
 A HUGE RACE.
 SHANNON: WOULD HE BE NUMBER 20?
 WE ARE OFFICIALLY AT 19.
 HE WOULD BE 20 PRESUMABLY.
