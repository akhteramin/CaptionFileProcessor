 TODAY AND TOMORROW. VIRGINIA GOVERNOR RALPH
 NORTHAM CONTINUES TO DEFY CALLS
 TO RESIGN AND NOW FORMER
 CLASSMATES ARE STANDING BY HIM
 AFTER A RACIST PHOTO WAS
 UNCOVERED IN HIS OLD YEARBOOK.
 BAD NEWS FOR WIZARDS FANS,
 WHY YOU WON'T SEE JOHN WALL IN
 A WIZARDS UNIFORM FOR AT LEAST
 ANOTHER YEAR.
 AND COOLER TEMPERATURES
 TODAY WITH A WET COMMUTE
 TONIGHT, MIRI MARSHALL IS
 TRACKING THE RAIN AND SHOWERS
 FOR YOU.
 GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.
 WE HAVE A YELLOW WEATHER ALERT
 BECAUSE OF THOSE SHOWERS THAT
 MAY IMPACT YOUR EVENING COMMUTE
 TODAY, BUT WHETHER WHIPLASH,
 THAT IS THE PHRASE OF THE DAY,
 BECAUSE WE HAVE TEMPERS THAT
 WILL BE MUCH COOLER THAN WHAT
 WE EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY, RIGHT
 AT 47 DEGREES IN DC METRO RIGHT
 NOW.
 TEMPERATURES TODAY 48 TO 53
 DEGREES, WE TOPPED OUT AT 74
 DEGREES IN DC YESTERDAY FOR A
 RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES
 YESTERDAY, BUT TODAY, MUCH
 COOLER AIR IS IN PLACE ALONG
 WITH SHOWERS AND CLOUDY SKIES.
 THE BEST TIME FOR SHOWERS IN
 METRO IS AROUND THE 5:00 HOUR
 AND HERE IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
 ON THE FUTURECAST.
 WE CAN SEE SHOWERS ACROSS
 MARTINSBURG AND HAGERSTOWN AND
 EVEN THROUGH FREDERICK AND
 LEESBURG.
 BY 5:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, WE
 SEE SHOWERS PUSHING INTO THE DC
 METRO AREA, SO LIGHT RAIN ALL
 THE WAY HOME COULD SLOW YOU
 DOWN AND EVEN AT 8:00 TONIGHT,
 STILL SOME RAIN LINGERING AND
 MODERATE SHOWERS ALONG THE
 FREDERICKSBURG AREA.
 THESE ARE SOME OF THE REASONS
 WE'VE ISSUED THE YELLOW WEATHER
 ALERT.
 THURSDAY MORNING AT 8 AM,
 LIKELY SOME SHOWERS IN THE
 MORNING AS YOU ARE HEADING TO
 WORK, BUT THURSDAY AFTERNOON,
 WE BEGIN TO SEE THIS
 TEMPERATURES REMAIN IN THE 50s
 AND 60s, AND WE BEGIN TO SEE
 THE RAIN CHANCES SORT OF
 DISSIPATE A BIT UNTIL FRIDAY
 WHEN THE FINAL FEATURE COMES
 IN, THE COLD FRONT HEADING OUR
 WAY WHICH WILL REALLY BEGIN TO
 CHANGE OUR WEATHER PATTERN
 ALTOGETHER.
 LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE WILL SEE
 OVER THE NEXT 12 HOURS, 47 BY
 NOON AND RIGHT AROUND 49 BY
 4:00 AND BY 6 PM, RIGHT ON THE
 50 DEGREE MARK.
 SO YOU CAN SEE THE TEMPERATURE
 SLOWLY RISING.
 THE NEXT FIVE DAYS LOOK LIKE
 THIS, TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s
 TODAY AND TOMORROW AND 50s
 TODAY, THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, 60s
 AGAIN AND LOOK AT THE SHARP
 DROP FROM FRIDAY COME 60s THE
 39 DEGREES ON SATURDAY, 41
 DEGREES BY SUNDAY.
 MUCH COLDER AIR IS ON THE WAY.
 WE HAVE TO PRESS REWIND ON
 YESTERDAY FOR JUST A BIT.
 IT IS ALMOST LIKE WE WENT FROM
 POLAR VORTEX TO SOLAR VORTEX
 WHICH IS NOT A REAL
 METEOROLOGICAL TERM, JUST THE
 FANCY WAVES AND WE HAD WARM AIR
 AROUND HERE.
 CHECK THIS OUT, JANUARY 31, 10
 DEGREES WAS THE LOW
 TEMPERATURE, YESTERDAY, WE
 TOPPED OUT AT 74 DEGREES FOR
 RECORD WARMTH AND THAT'S A 64
 DEGREE DIFFERENCE IN JUST A FEW
 DAYS.
 WHAT A DIFFERENCE A JET
 STREAM MAKES.
 I WILL TAKE THE DAY ON THE
 RIGHT.
 PLEASE, NO MORE POLAR VORTEX
 IS.
 WE'RE LOOKING AT A CRASH ON
 SUSAN PARKWAY.
 OUR PHOTOGRAPHER IS ON FORREST
 MILL ROAD TRYING TO GET FROM
 FOREST HILL TO SUITLAND AND
 THAT'S SHUTDOWN RIGHT NOW,
 TRYING TO HEAD INBOUND ON SUSAN
 PARKWAY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AS
 WELL, WE'VE HAD A SERIOUS CRASH
 DUE TO ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION.
 OUT ON SUSAN PARKWAY, YOU'LL BE
 OKAY THIS IS RIGHT HERE BY
 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AND ROUTE 4
 WITH SLIGHT DELAYS JUST BEFORE
 YOU GET TO THE BELTWAY.
 AND REPORTS OF A NEW CRASH ON I-
 66, THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE
 BESIDES THE SUITLAND HEADING
 EASTBOUND AS YOU GO THROUGH
 GAINESVILLE BY ROUTE 29.
 RAKING FROM OVERNIGHT, FIRE
 FORCES FOR PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR
 HOMES IN SOUTHEAST DC.
 FIREFIGHTERS HAD TO WORK
 QUICKLY WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN
 THE 1300 BLOCK OF E STREET,
 BECAUSE FLAMES WERE COMING OUT
 OF THE SECOND STORY WINDOW.
 THAT WAS THE ONLY ROOM THAT
 BURNED.
 INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN AT THE
 SCENE OVERNIGHT TO TRY TO
 DETERMINE HOW THE FIRE STARTED
 PEOPLE ARE TOLD THE FOUR PEOPLE
 DISPLACED ALL FOUND OTHER
 PLACES TO SPEND THE NIGHT.
 IN THE COUNTRY IN THE
 MEANTIME IS REACTING TO
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND STATE
 OF THE UNION ADDRESS THIS
 MORNING.
 LAST NIGHT, HE CALLED FOR AN
 END TO THE POLITICAL STALEMATE
 BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND
 REPUBLICANS.
 MET GREGORY IS LIVE ON
 CAPITOL HILL WITH MORE ON THE
 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AND
 THE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE.
 GOOD MORNING.
 LAST NIGHT, THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WAS
 VOLVO CALL FOR UNITY AS WELL AS
 A RALLYING CRY FOR HIS
 ACCOMPANIMENTS AND GOALS THAT
 HE IS SET OUT AND THE DEMOCRATS
 HIT BACK RIGHT AFTER WITH A
 RESPONSE THAT SAID THAT ALL THE
 POLITICAL DISCOURSE COMES FROM
 THE PRESIDENT.
 HERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT
 ARE FROM THE STATE OF THE UNION
 AND THE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE,
 NUMBER ONE, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 CALLED FOR CONGRESS TO PASS
 TIGHTER BORDER SECURITY
 MEASURES INCLUDING A CONTINUED
 CALL FOR A BORDER WALL BETWEEN
 THE U.S. AND MEXICO, NUMBER
 TWO, THE PRESIDENT REVEALED HE
 WILL HAVE ANOTHER MEETING WITH
 NORTH KOREAN PRESIDENT KIM JONG-
 UN.
 IT WILL TAKE EVERY 27th AND 28
 IN VIETNAM AND THE GOAL IS TO
 GET AN AGREEMENT FOR
 DENUCLEARIZATION.
 AND GEORGIA DEMOCRAT AND A
 FORMER CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR
 STACEY ABRAMS DELIVERED THE
 REBUTTAL BLAMING THE PRESIDENT
 FOR THE DIVISIVENESS OF THE
 COUNTRY.
 SHE POINTED TO THE 35 DAY
 PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AS
 AN EXAMPLE OF HIS REFUSAL TO
 COMPROMISE AND HOW THAT HURT
 THE COUNTRY.
 I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE
 PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
 ENDED WITH A TEMPORARY FUNDING
 BILL, AND THAT WILL RUN OUT ON
 FEBRUARY 15, THAT MEANS IF AN
 AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND
 THE PRESIDENT ISN'T REACHED BY
 THE 15th, WE WILL GO BACK TO
 ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE
 HOUSE CHAMBER WAS A WOMAN WE
 FIRST MET DURING THE GOVERNMENT
 SHUTDOWN.
 FAYE SMITH IS A FEDERAL
 CONTRACTOR FURLOUGHED DURING
 THE SHUTDOWN AND SHE ALONG WITH
 THOUSANDS OF OTHERS NEVER GOT
 BACK PAY AND YOU STEPPED UP TO
 HELP FLOODING A GOFUNDME
 ACCOUNT WITH DONATIONS.
 SHE ATTENDED AS A GUEST OF
 ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON.
 MR. TRUMP, PLEASE, THIS
 POINT, JUST GO AHEAD AND BUILD
 YOUR WELCOME YOU SAY YOU WAS
 GOING TO BUILD IT, YOU WERE
 GOING TO PAY FOR IT, PAY FOR
 IT.
 MS. NANCY IS NOT GOING TO PAY
 FOR THE WALL, STOP HOLDING US
 HOSTAGE EVERY TIME YOU GET A
 NOTE.
 WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU, DO
 YOU THINK THE STATE OF THE
 UNION ADDRESS WILL HELP UNITE
 BOTH PARTIES?
 YOU CAN VOTE ON OUR WEBSITE,
 WUSA9.COM/VOTE OR THE  WUSA9
 APP . YOU CAN SAY YES OR NO OR
 NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
 YOU CAN CHECK ON THE RESULTS TO
 THE REST OF THE MORNING AND
 MARCELLA ROBERTSON IS LIVE ON
 CAPITOL HILL TO VERIFY SOME OF
 THE CLAIMS THE PRESIDENT MADE.
 GOOD MORNING.

 DURING THE 82 MINUTE SPEECH
 LAST NIGHT, HE TOUCHED ON A LOT
 OF THINGS FROM JOBS IN THE
 ECONOMY TO NORTH KOREA, AND WE
 HAVE RESEARCHERS FACT CHECKING
 THE SPEECH LIVE, SO THIS
 MORNING I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK
 AT THREE SEPARATE CLAIMS AND
 WHETHER THEY ARE TRUE OR FALSE.
 JUST OVER 2 YEARS SINCE THE
 ELECTION, WE'VE CREATED 5.3
 MILLION NEW JOBS.
 STARTING WITH JOBS TO GET
 ANSWERS, WENT TO THE BUREAU OF
 LABOR STATISTICS AND ACCORDING
 TO THE BUREAU, ONCE THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION STARTED AFTER
 THE JANUARY TO 2017 ELECTION,
 THEY ADDED 4.9 MILLION NEW
 JOBS, NOT 5.3 MILLION, SO WE
 CAN VERIFY THAT CLAIM IS FALSE.
 IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, THE
 BRAVE ICE OFFICERS MADE 266,000
 ARRESTS OF CRIMINAL ALIENS
 INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED OR
 CONVICTED OF NEARLY 100,000
 ASSAULTS, 30,000 SEX CRIMES AND
 4000 KILLINGS.
 THIS ONE IS VERIFIED.
 DATA KEPT BY ICE PACKS UP
 THESE NUMBERS.
 THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS IS
 CORRECT, BUT THERE IS ALSO
 IMPORTANT CONTEXT.
 THOSE 266,000 ARRESTS, ABOUT
 HALF OF THEM WERE FOR ASSAULT
 AND SEX CRIMES AND MURDER AND
 THE OTHER HALF WERE FOR
 NONVIOLENT CRIMES INCLUDING
 ILLEGAL ENTRY.
 OUR HOSTAGES HAVE COME HOME.
 NUCLEAR TESTING HAS STOPPED,
 AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A
 MISSILE LAUNCH IN MORE THAN 15
 MONTHS.
 THAT IS ALSO VERIFIED.
 WE HAVEN'T TESTED ANY
 BALLISTIC MISSILE SINCE
 NOVEMBER 29 OF 2017.
 AND WE HAVE THE FULL FACT
 CHECKING ON WUSA9.COM.
 AND WE ALSO HAVE STATEMENTS
 THAT WERE FACT CHECKED FROM THE
 DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE TO THE
 SPEECH LAST NIGHT.
 THAT IS THE LATEST OUTSIDE
 CAPITOL HILL.
 I WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU.
 LET'S SEE HOW YOU ARE VOTING
 SO FAR IN THE POLL.
 WE ASKED IF THE STATE OF THE
 UNION WOULD HELP UNITE PARTIES,
 SO FAR, 54% OF THE PEOPLE SAID
 THEY NEVER HAD A CHANCE AND
 CONTINUE TO VOTE AND WEIGH IN
 AND WE WILL CHECK ON THE
 RESULTS THROUGHOUT THE MORNING,
 LET'S GO TO MIRI NOW , I'M
 STILL HANGING ONTO YESTERDAY.
 IT WAS SUCH A GLORIOUS DAY,
 RECORD WARMTH YESTERDAY WITH
 TEMPERATURES AROUND 74 AND WE
 KISS THAT GOODBYE TODAY.?
 OH BACK TO COOLER TREND.
 HERE ARE THE TOP THREE THINGS
 YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
 WEATHER.
 SHOWERS, THAT'S THE KEY WORD
 TODAY, WE ARE LOOKING AT RAIN
 AFTER 2:00 TODAY AS WE HAVE A
 FRONT STALLING ACROSS THE AREA,
 AND ALSO THURSDAY AND FRIDAY,
 MORE RAIN WILL BE IN THE
 FORECAST, COLDER THIS WEEKEND,
 THAT'S THE TREND AND NEXT
 WEEK'S TREND CALLS FOR COLDER
 WEATHER AND RAIN AND SNOW
 CHANCES.
 WINTER IS GOING TO SHOW UP,
 FINALLY.
 47 AS YOU STEP OUT IN DC TODAY,
 38 AROUND THE MANASSAS AREA AND
 HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY, 40 TO
 53 WITH SHOWERS AND CLOUDY
 SKIES, WE WILL BE IN THE UPPER
 40s TO MID-50s, DC SOUTH AND
 AREAS WILL LIKELY GET LOCKED
 INTO THE 40s TODAY, FOR THE
 NEXT FEW HOURS, THIS IS WHAT IT
 LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF THE
 HOURLY PLANNER, TEMPTRESS OF
 THE 46 BY 9 AM AND 46 BY 11 AM,
 WE HOLD TIGHT IN THE 40s FOR
 THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY AND
 WRITE ABOUT 40 DEGREES BY 1:00
 THIS AFTERNOON AND AT THAT
 POINT, YOU COULD SEE LIGHT
 SHOWERS ESPECIALLY NORTH AND
 WEST OF THE DC METRO AREA.
 2:30 TODAY, SHOWERS ARE IN
 MARTINSBURG AND WINCHESTER IN
 HAGERSTOWN AND WE ADVANCE THE
 CLOCK TO 6:00 AND THIS IS PRIME
 TIME TO HEAD HOME INTO RUSH
 HOUR AND WE HAVE LIGHT RAIN
 FALLING.
 IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE
 ISSUED THE YELLOW WEATHER ALERT
 BECAUSE THERE WILL BE THE LIGHT
 RAIN AND THE TIMING OF IT
 DURING THE EVENING RUSH.
 EVEN TO THE DINNER HOUR AT 8
 PM, WE LOOK AT SOME RAIN AND
 MODERATE SHOWERS RATHER SPUR
 GARY.
 TOMORROW MORNING WILL BE THE
 BETTER TIME TO SEE SHOWERS OVER
 THERE.
 WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT
 TEMPERATURES IN THE 50s AND 40s
 AT 8 AM AND THAT COMMUTE WILL
 BE A WET ONE FOR YOU AS WELL.
 AND THURSDAY AFTERNOON HAS A
 SLIGHT BREAK FROM THE RAIN
 BEFORE WE GET THE MAIN COLD
 FRONT MAKING ITS WAY IN ON
 FRIDAY WHICH WILL KNOCK OUT ALL
 OF THIS ABOVE AVERAGE
 TEMPERATURES.
 SO THE NEXT FIVE DAYS LOOK LIKE
 THIS AND WE SEE 50s TODAY RIGHT
 ON 65 TOMORROW AND 60s ON
 FRIDAY, BUT TEMPERATURE BEGAN
 TO DROP AS THE COLD FRONT COMES
 IN.
 LOOK AT THIS SHARP CHANGE IN
 TEMPERATURES FROM 60s FRIDAY
 DOWN TO A HIGH OF ONLY 39
 DEGREES ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY
 HAS A HIGH OF 41 DEGREES.
 WE HAVE SOME WINTER WEATHER IN
 THE FORECAST AND IT LOOKS LIKE
 MONDAY HAS A CHANCE FOR RAIN
 AND SNOW IN THE MORNING.
 ALL RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON.
 WE WILL SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS
 LIKE COMING UP IN THE NEXT
 UPDATE.
 I DISAGREE, THE REAL WINTER
 CAN SIT BACK DOWN AND THE FAKE
 SPRING CAN STAND BACK UP.
 WE HAVE A COUPLE ACCIDENTS
 ALREADY, WE HAVE A LIVE SHOT
 RIGHT NOW ON SUITLAND PARKWAY
 AT FOREST HILL ROAD, THIS WHITE
 TRUCK HAS BEEN PUT UP ON THE
 TOW TRUCK AND THEY ARE STILL
 TRYING TO PUSH THAT BACK A
 LITTLE BIT HERE TRYING TO
 FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN
 THE ACCIDENT AND HOW MANY, IT
 SOUNDS LIKE TO BE CLOSE, HOW
 MANY BLOOD ENTRIES BECAUSE THEY
 ARE DOING ACCIDENT
 RECONSTRUCTION WHICH MEANS IT
 HAS BEEN A SERIOUS CRASH.
 ALL LANES TRYING TO GO INBOUND
 ON SUITLAND PARKWAY HAVE BEEN
 CLOSED.
 OUTBOUND LANES ARE STILL OPEN
 AND THE AREA FROM FORTH THE
 ROAD TO TRY TO GET ONTO SUSAN
 PARKWAY HAS BEEN CLOSED AS WELL
 AND DELAYS ON PENNSYLVANIA
 AVENUE OR ROUTE 4 BEFORE YOU
 GET TO THE BELTWAY WHERE ALL OF
 THIS IS GOING ON AND WE HAVE AN
 ACCIDENT ON I-66, NO DELAYS,
 BUT THIS ONE IS OUT IN
 GAINESVILLE.
 A LOCAL MAN TALKS ABOUT HIS
 FIGHT TO SURVIVE A HEART
 ATTACK.

 GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME BACK TO WAKE UP WASHINGTON,
 IT'S FIVE DECK 14 ON YOUR
 WEDNESDAY, LET'S GET THE THREE
 THINGS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW
 BEFORE YOU GO OUT THE DOOR, AND
 THERE'S AN ARIZONA CHART WITH
 SEXUALLY ASSAULTING AN
 INCAPACITATED WOMAN HAS PLED
 NOT GUILTY.
 NATHAN SUTHERLAND IS CHARGED
 WITH RAPING A WOMAN  IN THE
 FACILITY.
 HE WAS ARRESTED AFTER HIS DNA
 MATCHED A BLOOD SAMPLE FROM THE
 SUN.
 HE REMAINS IN JAIL ON HALF $1
 MILLION BOND.
 JURY DELIBERATIONS CONTINUE
 FOR JOAQUIN EL CHAPO GUZMAN,
 THEY SAY HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
 AT LEAST 200 TONS OF COCAINE IN
 THE U.S. HE PLED NOT GUILTY TO
 17 CATS WHICH INCLUDED DRUG
 TRAFFICKING AND MONEY
 LAUNDERING CHARGES.
 IF CONVICTED, HE FACES THE
 POSSIBILITY OF LIFE IN PRISON.
 AND POPE FRANCIS WRAPPED UP
 HIS TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
 1 MILLION PEOPLE CAME OUT TO
 SEE THE FIRST MASS IN THE
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES.
 HE TALKED ABOUT PEAS AND
 REJECTING WAR AND HE MADE
 HEADLINES ACKNOWLEDGING A
 SCANDAL OF PRIESTS AND BISHOPS
 ABUSING NUNS.
 HE SAID THEY NEED TO DO MORE TO
 COMBAT THE PROBLEM.
 FIVE DECK 15, PUTTING YOUR
 HEALTH FIRST AS PART OF THE
 MONTH-LONG HEALTH MATTERS
 SERIES THAT RAISES AWARENESS
 ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING
 YOUR BODY.
 FEBRUARY IS AMERICAN HEART
 MONTH, McKEE AND TURNER SAT
 DOWN WITH A PERSON WHO IS
 THANKFUL TO BE ALIVE.
 YOU HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE A
 MONTH BEFORE YOUR BIRTHDAY AND
 IT IS A REAL WAKE-UP CALL.
 Reporter: CHRISTOPHER ROBIN
 WAS JUST A FEW WEEKS SHY OF HIS
 51st BIRTHDAY.
 RIGHT AROUND MIDNIGHT,
 STARTED AT THIS INCREDIBLE
 SENSATION IN MY ARMS AND IN MY
 CHEST AS IF SOMEONE WERE TAKING
 THEIR NAILS AND JUST RAKING
 THROUGH MY ARM, INSIDE, AND
 THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO
 ABOUT IT.
 Reporter: HE FELT A SIMILAR
 FEELING BEFORE, BUT THIS TIME
 WAS DIFFERENT, THIS WAS SCARY,
 HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
 IT WAS WORKING ITS WAY DOWN
 BOTH BICEPS AND INTO MY
 FOREARMS AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
 I WAS PRETTY MUCH IN TROUBLE.
 I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE IT AS WHAT
 I CALL THE REAPER'S EMBRACE.
 IT WAS PRETTY TERRIFYING.
 AND I SAID, GOD, I'M NOT READY
 TO CHECK OUT, BUT I CAN'T CHECK
 IN BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
 HEALTHCARE.
 BETWEEN JOBS AND WORRIED
 ABOUT EXPENSES, HE WAS TRYING
 TO SURVIVE.
 HE WAS RUSHED TO RESTON MEDICAL
 CENTER WHERE HE LEARNED ABOUT
 BLOCKAGES IN AN ARTERY AND
 STENTS WERE INSERTED TO HELP
 BLOOD FLOW.
 IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
 TO GET ROUTINE CHECKUPS AND
 IT'S COVERED, GO EVERY SIX
 MONTHS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE
 AGE OF 40, BECAUSE THE
 LIKELIHOOD OF YOU HAVING A
 SITUATION LIKE I HAD IS GOING
 TO BE, IT'S GOING TO BE GREATER
 AND GREATER.
 THAT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE
 STORY.
 WHEN HE HAD HEALTHCARE, HE GOT
 RID OF IT AND HE DIDN'T GET
 CHECKUPS, NOW HE IS FIGHTING
 FOR IT AFTER LOSING A BUSINESS
 HE OWNED FOR 30 YEARS.
 HIS MEDICAL BILLS TOTALED
 ALMOST $90,000, BUT A CHARITY
 PROGRAM AT RESTON HOSPITAL
 CENTER WAIVED SOME OF THE
 BILLS.
 AND THAT IS WHY THIS THURSDAY
 IS SO IMPORTANT.
 THAT IS TOMORROW.
 WE HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF
 REGULAR CHECKUPS.
 KEEP THIS IN MIND, WE DO THAT
 BY HOLDING A FREE HEALTH EXPO
 AT THE YMCA IN RESTON, WE CALL
 IT IMPACT HEALTH MATTERS, WE
 OFFER BLOOD PRESSURE AND BMI
 AND DIABETES EDUCATION AND CPR
 AND ALL OF THE SCREENINGS ARE
 FREE.
 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIGN UP
 FOR THEM AND THERE WILL BE TWO
 SESSIONS, 70 AND THROUGH NOON
 AND 2 PM THROUGH 7:00.
 THAT'S THE SECOND ONE, JUST GO
 TO OUR WEBSITE,
 WUSA9.COM/HEALTH MATTERS  FOR
 MORE.
 THE TIME IS 5:18 ON THIS
 WEDNESDAY, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
 AT?
 WE HAVE A WARM AND COLD
 FRONT STALLING AROUND THE AREA.
 THIS RED LINE REPRESENTS THE
 WARM FRONT AND THE BLUE ONE IS
 THE COLD FRONT, THAT IS
 STRADDLED ACROSS BASICALLY THE
 MARYLAND AND PENNSYLVANIA
 BORDER.
 WE HAVE THE STALLED FRONT WITH
 SHOWERS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES
 ESPECIALLY WITH A LITTLE BIT
 MORE CLOUD COVER TODAY.
 OUTSIDE THE DOOR, 47 IN DC AND
 46 IN THE FREDERICKSBURG AREA.
 NOTICEABLY COOLER TODAY BUT
 STILL ABOVE AVERAGE, 43 DEGREES
 IS THE TEMPERATURE RANGE,
 SHOWERS OUT THERE UNDER CLOUDY
 SKIES AND THE BEST TIME FOR
 SHOWERS WILL BE AFTER 3:00
 TODAY IN THE DC METRO AREA IN
 AREAS NORTH AND WEST OF DC AND
 ANYTIME AFTER 20 CLOCK IS FAIR
 GAME.
 46 BY 10 AM AND 48 BY 2:00 THIS
 AFTERNOON AND RIGHT AROUND 50
 BY 6 PM WITH RAIN FALLING OUT
 THERE.
 WE SEE THE BETTER CHANCE FOR
 RAIN THIS AFTERNOON, THAT'S ONE
 OF THE REASONS WHY TOPPER SHUTT
 ISSUED THE YELLOW WEATHER
 ALERT.
 HE KNOWS WHEN YOU GET THE
 RAINDROPS MIXING IN WITH
 EVENING RUSH, IT SLOWS THINGS
 DOWN . HERE ARE THREE THINGS TO
 KNOW, MOST AREAS WILL SEE
 SHOWERS AFTER 2:00 TODAY AND WE
 HAVE SHOWERS THURSDAY AND
 FRIDAY AS WELL.
 SHOWERS, THIS WEEKEND GETS
 COLDER, TEMPERATURES FALLING
 BACK TO 30s AND 40s FOR DAYTIME
 HIGHS AND NEXT WEEK HAS WINTER
 COMING BACK.
 AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN WINTER IN A
 WHILE AFTER RECORD WARM
 TEMPERATURES YESTERDAY TOPPING
 OUT AT 74.
 IT WAS SO GREAT.
 NONE OF THAT TODAY.
 WE WILL BE MUCH COOLER OUT
 THERE.
 MAYBE A JACKET AND UMBRELLA
 KEEPS THE COMPANY.
 WINCHESTER AND HAGERSTOWN AND
 WINCHESTER TODAY AROUND 2:00
 HAS RAIN FALLING AND AT 6:00,
 WE SEE RAIN AROUND THE DC METRO
 AREA WITH TEMPERATURES HOLDING
 OFF IN THE 50s AT THIS POINT
 AND EVEN IN THE DINNER HOUR, WE
 ARE LOOKING AT RAIN.
 LET'S LOOK AT THE BEST TIME TO
 SEE IT, IN THE MORNING
 SOMEWHERE AROUND 7:00 OR 8:00
 AND WE HAVE LIGHT RAN ACROSS DC
 METRO AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN
 THE AFTERNOON, A LITTLE BIT OF
 A BREAK IN THE RAIN BEFORE WE
 GET THE MAIN FRONT MAKING ITS
 WAY IN BY FRIDAY.
 FRIDAY STARTS OFF WITH
 TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s AND
 TEMPERATURES DROP IN THE
 AFTERNOON WITH A COLD FRONT
 COMING IN.
 AHEAD OF THE FRONT,
 TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s BEHIND
 THAT WITH 20s AND TEENS FOR THE
 DAYTIME HIGHS AS WE LOOK AT THE
 MIDWEST.
 LOOK AT TEMPERATURES IN THE
 UPPER 30s ON SATURDAY BEHIND
 THE FRONT.
 A PRETTY STRONG COLD FRONT
 COMING IN, 41 DEGREES ON SUNDAY
 BEHIND THE COLD FRONT WITH
 WINTER WEATHER MAKING ITS WAY
 BACK AS I ELUDED TO NEXT WEEK.
 COLDER AIR IN PLACE AND
 DISTURBANCES PASSING BY.
 THAT WILL BE THE SETUP.
 MONDAY MORNING STARTS WITH A
 RAIN AND SNOW MIX POSSIBLE AND
 THEN IT CHANGES OVER TO ALL
 RAIN BY LATE MONDAY MORNING
 INTO MONDAY AFTERNOON.
 LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT THE
 TRENDS WITH THE MODELS.
 LOOK AT THE GFS FIRST AND IT
 HAS BEEN SHIFTING TO RAIN AND
 SNOW A LITTLE BIT FURTHER
 NORTH, THAT'S THE TREND I'VE
 SEEN CHANGE WITHIN THE LAST DAY
 OR TWO.
 WE WILL STILL GET SOME RAIN AND
 SNOW AROUND 5 AM MONDAY, BUT IT
 LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF AREAS
 ESPECIALLY AROUND
 FREDERICKSBURG AND CULPEPER AND
 MANASSAS STAYS IN AN ALL RAIN
 SITUATION.
 AND THEN TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY
 HAS ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN AND
 SNOW AND PERHAPS BY WEDNESDAY,
 ALL SNOW, BUT THEN WE ARE STILL
 SEVERAL DAYS OUT, THIS IS NOT A
 LOCK AND LOAD SITUATION, THERE
 WILL BE STILL SOME TIME TO FINE-
 TUNE IT, BUT JUST KEEP IN MIND,
 NEXT WEEK, IT WILL GET MESSY
 AGAIN WITH THE RAIN AND SNOW
 MAKING ITS WAY BACK INTO THE
 FORECAST.
 HERE IS THE 70, 53 TODAY, 65
 DEGREES THURSDAY AND SICK
 BEFORE WITH FALLING
 TEMPERATURES AND 41 SUNDAY AND
 SUNDAY NIGHT, AS EARLY AS
 SUNDAY NIGHT, YOU SEE THE
 SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME SNOW
 MIXING IN FOR THE NORTHERN
 SUBURBS, BUT REALLY BY MONDAY
 AND TUESDAY, YOU SEE THE MIX
 ONCE AGAIN.
 AT LEAST WE HAD THIS BRIEF
 BREAK.
 WE'VE BEEN ENJOYING IT.
 WE HAVE A CLOSURE ON SUSAN
 PARKWAY AS HE TRIED TO HEAD
 INBOUND.
 OUTBOUND IS OKAY, BUT THE LAST
 TIME I SHOWED YOU THIS LIVE
 SHOT FROM OUR PHOTOGRAPHER ON
 THE SCENE, WE SAW A WHITE TOE
 TRUCK, A WHITE PICKUP TRUCK
 BEING TOWED AWAY.
 HE SAYS HE'S SEEN ANOTHER CAR
 SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE ALSO
 BEING PUT UP ON A TOW TRUCK.
 IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WERE TWO
 VEHICLES INVOLVED, PRETTY
 SERIOUS INJURIES AND WE ARE
 STILL DOING ACCIDENT
 RECONSTRUCTION AND YOU CAN SEE
 IT WITH A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE
 AND THERE'S THE WHITE TOE TRUCK
 RIGHT THERE, IT HASN'T LEFT THE
 SCENE YET, BUT ALL INBOUND
 LANES ON SUSAN PARKWAY, AT
 FORCEFUL ROAD
       I'm off to college.
  I'm worried about my parents'  retirement.
           Don't worry.
  Voya helps them to and through  retirement...
       dealing with today's       expenses...
  while helping plan, invest and  protect for the future.
       So they'll be okay?
     I think they'll be fine.
     Voya. Helping you to and     through retirement.
 WELCOME BACK AND, ANIMAL LOVERS IN PENNSYLVANIA HAVE
 CREATED AN APP THAT THEY ARE
 CALLING TENDER FOR DOGS.
 IT IS CALLED PET FEATURES
 PROFILES OF DOGS AVAILABLE FOR
 ADOPTION IN LOCAL SHELTERS.
 USERS CAN SCROLL THROUGH WITH
 MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DOG
 AND SWIPE RIGHT IF THEY ARE
 INTERESTED.
 SO IF YOU SWIPE LEFT, THE
 NEXT DOG APPEARS, THE PLAN IS
 TO EVENTUALLY INCLUDE CATS AND
 OTHER ANIMALS AS WELL.
 I LIKE THE IDEA, BECAUSE YOU
 CAN FIND COMPANIONSHIP BY
 READING UP ON THE DOGS, LITTLE
 MORE INTIMATE EXPERIENCE, BUT I
 FEEL LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT ONE-
 SIDED, WHAT IF THE DOG DOESN'T
 LIKE YOU?
 AT LEAST AT THE SHELTER,
 THEY CAN SMITE, THEY CAN READ
 THEIR BODY LANGUAGE AND DOGS
 ARE REALLY SMART, SO THEY CAN
 BARK OR GRAVEL AT YOU.
 THE BRANDING AS TENDER FOR
 DOGS, IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST
 , BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT TENDER
 IS ACTUALLY FOR.
 I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A
 SOCIAL UNDERSTANDING.
 NEXT UP, CHILD IN ALABAMA
 WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO TRY TO
 GET A TOY TO A 2-YEAR-OLD AND
 IT GOT A LITTLE TOO SERIOUS IN
 A RESTAURANT AND GOT STUCK
 INSIDE ONE OF THOSE CLAW
 MACHINES WE TRY TO GRAB A
 PRIZE.
 I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW
 THIS HAPPENS.
 FORTUNATELY, THE CHILD WAS NOT
 HURT.
 THAT'S GOOD NEWS, BUT GETTING
 HIM OUT CERTAINLY WAS NOT EASY.
 NO ONE AT THE RESTAURANT EVEN
 HAD A KEY TO OPEN THE MACHINE,
 SO FIREFIGHTERS HAD TO STEP IN
 AND TAKE IT APART AND RESCUE
 HIM.
 THE LITTLE GUY CLIMBED UP IN
 THERE.
 THE PROPENSITY FOR THIS TO
 HAPPEN IS HIGHER IF YOU HAVE
 MORE KIDS, BECAUSE YOU ARE MORE
 LIKELY, LIKE HE HAS BROTHERS
 AND SISTERS, SO IT'S EASIER TO
 LOSE ONE IN THE SHUFFLE IF YOU
 ARE PARENTING 2 TO 3 TO 4 KIDS
 OR SO AS OPPOSED TO JUST NO
 ONE.
 IF YOU JUST HAVE THE ONE, THEN
 YOU HAVE LITTLE TO NO EXCUSE
 LET THAT HAPPEN.
 BUT HE IS FINE.
 I'M SO GLAD HE IS OKAY.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE
 STATE OF THE UNION IS STRONG WE
 WILL HAVE MORE ON HIS SPEECH
 INCLUDING NEW PLANS TO MEET
 WITH KIM JONG UN.
 AND WE WILL
     <i> When was the last time</i>          <i> you felt...</i>
              <i> Free.</i>
      <i> It's time to uncover</i>      <i> that feeling again.</i>
     <i> With the compassion and</i>      <i> strength of a name...</i>

         <i> Live fearless.</i>
 [ MUSIC ] 5:30, WELCOME BACK TO WAKE UP WASHINGTON.
 THE BIG WEATHER STORY TODAY,
 BIG SWING AT TEMPERATURES AND
 WE HAVE SOME SHOWERS MARCHING
 IN THIS AFTERNOON.
 IT IS 47 AS YOU STEP OUT IN DC
 METRO AND WE TOPPED OUT AROUND
 THE 53 DEGREE MARK TODAY AND WE
 HAD A HIGH OF 74 IN DC, SO LET
 THESE COOLER TEMPERATURES SINK
 IN FOR A MOMENT BEFORE YOU STEP
 OUTSIDE.
 LOOKING AT SHOWERS AND THE BEST
 TIME TO SEE THE SHOWERS IN
 METRO DC WILL BE RIGHT AROUND
 THE 5:00 OUR AND WE START TO
 SEE THEM IN THE NORTH AND
 WESTERN SUBURBS ANYTIME AFTER 2
 PM.
 THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BY
 THE HOUR, 46 BY 10 AM, 48 BY
 2:00 AND WRITER 50 BY 6 PM WITH
 SHOWERS FALLING ACROSS THE
 AREA.
 ON FUTURECAST HIM HE COULD SEE
 BY 2:00, 2:30, THE
 FREDERICKSBURG AND LEESBURG
 AREA AND 6:00 HAS LIGHTNING.
 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
 TOPPER ISSUED A YELLOW WEATHER
 LIVE BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF
 ALL THIS.
 8:00 IS THE DINNER HOURS, WE
 STILL HAVE LIGHT TO MODERATE
 SHOWERS TO THE FREDERICKSBURG
 AREA FALLING ACROSS DC METRO.
 DURING THE MORNING COMMUTE, THE
 EVENING COMMUTE TOMORROW LOOKS
 DRIER.
 THERE WILL BE A LAG.
 CAN WE GET A BREAK TOMORROW
 AFTERNOON BUT TEMPERATURES GET
 BACK TO THE 60s ONCE AGAIN.
 THIS IS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE
 WHEN IT COMES TO TEMPERATURES.
 JUST BUCKLE UP AND GET READY.
 THE NEXT FEW DAYS LOOK LIKE
 THIS, 50s TODAY AND MID-
 SIXTIES, RIGHT AROUND 65 ON
 THURSDAY AND 64 ON FRIDAY AND A
 SHARP DROP IN TEMPERATURES.
 A STRONG COLD FRONT COMES IN
 TAKING US FROM 64 ON FRIDAY
 DOWN TO A HIGH OF JUST 39
 DEGREES BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY
 HAS A HIGH OF 41 DEGREES.
 AND DO NOT SCRATCH OUT WINTER
 JUST YET, WINTER WEATHER IS
 RETURNING, ESPECIALLY COMING UP
 NEXT WEEK AND WE LOOK AT A
 CHANCE FOR RAIN AND SNOW FOR
 BRIEF MOMENT MONDAY MORNING,
 AND THEN ALL RAIN BY MONDAY
 AFTERNOON.
 COMING UP IN THE NEXT UPDATE,
 WE SHOW YOU WHAT THIS LOOKS
 LIKE BY THE HOUR.
 GOOD NEWS, JUST BEFORE THE
 BIG RUSH HOUR KICKS IN, THE
 PARKWAY OPENS BACKUP.
 A LIVE SHOT HERE FROM THE EXACT
 SAME AREA AS LAST TIME, THE
 WHITE PICKUP TRUCK IS GONE AND
 THE TOW TRUCKS ARE GONE AND THE
 INBOUND LANES ARE OPENING UP.
 WE'VE HAD A CLOSURE SO FAR
 INBOUND AND WE SHOULD GET
 BETTER.
 THERE ARE SLIGHT DELAYS ON
 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE JUST BEFORE
 THE BELTWAY.
 TOP SIDE OF THE BELTWAY, OUTER
 LOOP LOOKS LIKE AN ACCIDENT AND
 WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS ON 266.
 EASTBOUND THROUGH GAINESVILLE
 BY 129, THE OTHER ACCIDENT IS
 WESTBOUND A I-66 GOING AWAY
 FROM DC, AND IT'S OUT OF THE
 LANES AS WELL.
 IT PROBABLY WON'T HAVE A BIG
 IMPACT FOR MOST COMMUTERS.
 IT HAS BEEN FIVE DAYS SINCE
 WE LEARNED ABOUT THE SHOCKING
 AND RACIST PHOTO IN THE 1984
 YEARBOOK OF RALPH NORTHAM, AND
 ALTHOUGH HE HASN'T BEEN IN
 PUBLIC FOR DAYS, HE SAYS HE
 WILL NOT RESIGN.
 HE GOT THE SUPPORT FROM HIS
 OLD CLASSMATES.
 IT'S DEFINITELY BEEN A VERY
 CHAOTIC WEEK.
 BUT NOW HE'S GETTING SUPPORT
 FROM NINE STUDENTS, ALL THAT
 HAVE COME FORWARD DEFENDING
 GOVERNOR NORTHAM.
 THEY WERE CLASSMATES OF HIS AT
 THE EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL
 SCHOOL.
 SO LET'S START RIGHT THERE AND
 TAKE A LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT
 THEY WROTE.
 THE STATEMENT WAS WE FULLY
 BELIEVE GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM
 IS NEITHER OF THE PEOPLE IN THE
 REPUBLIC COSTUMES.
 WE ATTENDED CLASSES AND
 SOCIALIZED WITH HIM AND KNEW
 HIM VERY WELL, BUT THINGS
 REMAINED PRETTY ROCKY FOR THE
 EMBATTLED GOVERNOR.
 HE HAS BEEN HELD UP IN THE
 EXECUTIVE MANSION AND CALENDAR
 NOT UPDATED FOR DAYS AND MANY
 PUBLIC EVENTS HAVE BEEN
 CANCELED, BUT BEHIND CLOSED
 DOORS, HE IS TRYING TO GOVERNOR
 AND HE SIGNED OFF ON GIVING
 MILLIONS AND HE SIGNED OFF ON
 CONDOLENCES FOR A STATE TROOPER
 KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND
 THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS HE
 PLANS TO HIRE A PRIVATE
 INVESTIGATOR TO LOOK INTO THE
 PICTURE AND FIND OUT HOW IT GOT
 IN THE YEARBOOK.
 MANY LAWMAKERS FROM DIFFERENT
 PARTIES EVEN TRADITIONAL ALLIES
 ARE CALLING FOR HIS
 RESIGNATION.
 I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY HE
 RESIGNED, BUT DOES
 WE'VE CALLED FOR THE
 RESIGNATION.
 ADDING TO THE CRISIS, SEXUAL
 ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS DATING BACK
 TO 2004 AGAINST HIS LIEUTENANT
 GOVERNOR, JUSTIN FAIRFAX WHO
 WOULD TAKE OVER IN A NORTHAM
 RESIGNATION OFFERED A STRONG
 DENIAL.
 THE ALLEGATION VAPORIZED FOR
 A YEAR AND RESURFACED ON THE
 EVE OF MY POTENTIAL ELEVATION
 GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION,
 IT'S COMPLETELY POLITICAL AND
 IS A SMEAR.
 WE ARE LEARNING THAT THE
 ACCUSER OF JUSTIN FAIRFAX HAS
 HIRED A LAWYER AND
 INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IT'S THE
 SAME LEGAL TEAM THAT
 REPRESENTED CHRISTINE BLASEY
 FORD.
 WHETHER RALPH NORTHAM WILL
 RESIGN IS ANYONE'S GUESS.
 REACTION IS POURING IN
 FOLLOWING THE SECOND STATE OF
 THE UNION ADDRESS.
 WE ASK, DO YOU THINK THE STATE
 OF THE UNION ADDRESS WILL HELP
 UNITE BOTH PARTIES?
 YOU CAN VOTE ON OUR WEBSITE OR
 THE WUSA9 APP.
 ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS
 WAS THE PLAN TO MEET WITH KIM
 JONG-UN.
 MUCH WORK REMAINS TO BE
 DONE, BUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
 KIM JONG-UN IS A GOOD ONE.
 CHAIRMAN KIM AND I WILL MEET
 AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 27 AND 28th
 IN VIETNAM.
 THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT
 THE NEED FOR A WALL ALONG THE
 SOUTHERN BORDER.
 IN THE PAST, MOST OF THE
 PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM VOTED FOR
 AWOL.
 BUT THE PROPER WALL NEVER GOT
 BUILT.
 I WILL GET IT BUILT.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP TO DECLARE
 NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO BUILD THE
 WALL, LAWMAKERS HAVE JUST NINE
 DAYS TO REACH A DEAL ON BORDER
 SECURITY BEFORE ANOTHER PARTIAL
 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN GOES INTO
 EFFECT.
 STACEY ABRAMS WHO LOST THE
 RACE FOR GEORGIA GOVERNOR LAST
 YEAR GAVE THE OFFICIAL
 DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE LAST NIGHT
 AND BLAME THE GOVERNMENT
 SHUTDOWN ON THE GOVERNMENT.
 COME UP ON THE PRESIDENT.
 IT WAS A STUNT ENGINEERED BY
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES, ONE THAT DEFIED EVERY
 TENET OF FAIRNESS AND ABANDON
 NOT JUST OUR PEOPLE, BUT OUR
 VALUES.
 SHE WENT ON TO SAY ALTHOUGH
 SHE DISAGREES WITH THE
 PRESIDENT, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO
 SEE HIM FAIL.
 WE ARE SEEING HOW YOU ARE
 VOTING, DO YOU THINK THE STATE
 OF THE UNION WILL HELP UNITE
 BOTH PARTIES.
 YOU HAVE 69% OF USING IT
 NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
 CONTINUE TO VOTE AND WEIGH IN
 AND WE CHECK ON THE RESULTS
 THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.
 THINGS GO FROM BAD TO MUCH
 WORSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE
 WIZARDS AND JOHN WALL.
 WILL TELL YOU WHY YOU WON'T
 SEE THE STAR POINT GUARD IN A
 WIZARDS UNIF

 5:40 NOW, A YELLOW WEATHER ALERT, BECAUSE WE HAVE COOLER
 AIR AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME
 SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST THIS
 AFTERNOON.
 47 DEGREES IN DC AND FOR KIDS
 WAITING AT THE BUS STOP, YOU
 MAY FIND TEMPERATURES IN THE
 30s AND 40s THROUGHOUT THE
 MORNING.
 YOU WILL SEE 46 DEGREES BY 6 AM
 AND 46 BY 9:00 AND 47 AT NOON
 AND AS KIDS GO HOME, LOOK FOR
 SHOWERS AND TEMPERATURES IN THE
 UPPER 40s ESPECIALLY IN UPPER
 SUBURBS AND DC APPROACHES THE
 50 DEGREE MARK LATER THIS
 AFTERNOON.
 WE HAVE A BIG DIFFERENCE FROM
 YESTERDAY WITH 70s, 48 TO MID-
 50s TODAY.
 SHOWERS AND CLOUDY AND THE BEST
 TIME FOR SHOWERS IS AROUND 5:00.
 NORTHERN AND WESTERN SUBURBS
 SEE THEM EARLIER, AT 230 TODAY,
 49 IN MARTINSBURG AND FREDERICK
 AROUND 50 AT 2:30 AND YOU SEE
 LIGHT SHOWERS FALLING.
 6:00 THIS EVENING HAS REIGNED
 OVER DC METRO AND ONE OF THE
 REASONS WE HAVE THE YELLOW
 WEATHER ALERT IS BECAUSE OF THE
 TIMING OF THIS RAIN.
 8:00 TONIGHT, DINNERTIME STILL
 HAS SHOWERS OUT THERE AND IT'S
 NOT UNTIL LATER TONIGHT THAT WE
 HAVE A BRIEF BREAK IN THE RAIN
 IN TOMORROW MORNING, THE
 COMMUTE WILL LIKELY BE WET AS
 WELL.
 AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE FRONT
 STALLING ACROSS THE AREA, THAT
 WILL GIVE US THE RAIN CHANCE
 AND WE HAVE THE WINDSHIELD
 WIPERS AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING
 AND A LITTLE BREAK IN THE
 AFTERNOON AS WE GET READY FOR
 THE MAIN COLD FRONT TO COME
 THROUGH FRIDAY WITH THE FINAL
 PUSH OF RAIN.
 THIS IS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE
 OF WEATHER.
 70s YESTERDAY, 50s TODAY, 65 ON
 THURSDAY WITH SHOWERS AND 64 ON
 FRIDAY AND WATCH TEMPERATURES
 DROPPED AT 39 FOR THE HIGH ON
 SATURDAY.
 THIS IS A BIG TEMPERATURE
 DIFFERENCE.
 MELISSA PUT SOLAR VORTEX VERSUS
 A POLAR VORTEX.
 [ LAUGHTER ] THERE IS NO SUCH
 THING AS A SOLAR VORTEX.
 BUT 10 DEGREES WAS A LOW
 TEMPERATURE ON JANUARY 31.
 YESTERDAY, WE SOARED UP TO 34.
 64 DEGREE DIFFERENCE IN THE
 SPAN OF JUST A FEW DAYS.
 SO AGAIN, MONDAY, WE LOOK AT
 THE CHANCE FOR RAIN AND SNOW
 AND EARLY MONDAY MORNING AT 5
 AM, WE CAN SEE THE RAIN MAKING
 ITS WAY INTO THE AREA AND
 MONDAY AFTERNOON, WE BEGIN THE
 TRANSITION TO ALL RAIN ACROSS
 METRO DC AND THERE IS SLIGHTLY
 WARMER AIR AND TUESDAY HAS A
 CHANCE FOR RAIN AND SNOW.
 THE MONDAY MORNING DRIVE
 MAY NOT BE GREAT, SNOW AND
 RAIN, WE WILL BE TRACKING IT
 FOR YOU AND LETTING YOU KNOW
 ABOUT DELAYS.
 WE ARE OPEN ON SUITLAND PARKWAY
 GOING INBOUND.
 THERE WAS A SERIOUS CRASH
 OVERNIGHT AND RECONSTRUCTION,
 BUT THEY'VE OPENED THE LANES.
 SOUTHBOUND HAS A PROBLEM BY
 ROUTE 7 AND ON THE OUTER LOOP
 OF THE BELTWAY, WE HAVE AN
 ACCIDENT REPORTED BY NEW
 HAMPSHIRE AVENUE AND ISSUES ON
 I-66, EASTBOUND IN GAINESVILLE
 IS THE GREATER CONCERN.
 THE OTHER ONE IS I-66 W. BOUND
 SO THIS SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT.
 HAVE YOU EVER SENT A
 MESSAGE
 WELCOME BACK IN EVERYBODY, IT IS 5:46.
 PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT NATURAL
 GAS LEAKS IN DC ARE INVITED TO
 SHARE EXPERIENCES WITH THE
 PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION.
 THEY ARE HOLDING THE REGULAR
 MEETING AT 2 PM TODAY, BUT
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE INVITED
 TO ASK OFFICIALS QUESTIONS
 ABOUT SAFETY PRACTICES AND
 PROCEDURES AMONGST OTHER
 THINGS.
 THEY ARE ACCEPTING WRITTEN
 COMMENTS FOR NEXT WEEK.
 EXTREMITY AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN
 REACHED TO SAVE THE FORT DuPONT
 ICE ARENA.
 IT WAS IN JEOPARDY AFTER THEY
 WERE CONSIDERING REALLOCATING
 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FUNDING
 COMMITTED TO THE FACILITY.
 BUT NOW THE FRIENDS OF FORT
 DuPONT SAY IT HAS BEEN SAVED.
 DC CHAIRMAN PHIL MENDELSON
 SCHEDULED A MEETING TO NAIL DOWN
 THE CURRENT STABILITY.
 FENNEL, PHIL MENDELSON WILL
 HAVE A MEETING TO RENOVATE THE
 FACILITY AND BREAK GROUND ON A
 SECOND ICE RINK.
 MORE BAD NEWS FOR WIZARDS FANS, WE KNEW JOHN WALL WOULD
 MISS THE SEASON, BUT NOW NEXT
 SEASON IS IN JEOPARDY.
 HE WILL MISS MOST IF NOT ALL OF
 NEXT SEASON BECAUSE HE NEEDS
 SURGERY ON HIS LEFT ACHILLES
 TENDON WHICH HE TORE ON A FALL
 AT HOME.
 THEY DISCOVERED THE INJURY
 DURING A PROCEDURE ON MONDAY.
 HE IS ASSIGNED TO THE 2023
 SEASON AND SET TO MAKE ALMOST
 $40 MILLION NEXT SEASON.
 LET'S GET ANOTHER CHECK ON
 THE FORECAST.
 GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.
 HERE IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT
 ACROSS THE AREA.
 TEMPERATURES, THE GRAPHIC IS
 STUCK, BUT IT IS LOADING.
 THIS IS WHAT WE LOOK AT ACROSS
 THE AREA.
 TEMPERATURES GETTING UP TO THE
 50s TODAY, SO A BIG CHANGE AND
 I THINK THIS IS STOCK.
 LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN, MY
 COMPUTER NEEDS A LITTLE COFFEE
 THIS MORNING.
 THERE WE GO.
 WE CAN SEE THE TEMPERATURES IN
 THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS WILL BE
 MODIFYING QUITE A BIT.
 I WANT TO START WITH WHAT'S
 HAPPENING RIGHT HERE AND WHAT
 WE ARE SEEING THIS MORNING.
 WE HAVE SOME CLOUDS AND SHOWERS
 OUT TO THE WEST OF US AND THAT
 IS BECAUSE OF THE FRONT THAT IS
 STALLED ACROSS THE AREA, SO
 LOOK TO THE NORTH AROUND
 MARYLAND AND PENNSYLVANIA
 BORDER, WE HAVE A WARM FRONT
 RIGHT THERE AND A COLD FRONT
 STRADDLING.
 THAT'S LINGERING ACROSS THE
 AREA AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE
 THESE FEATURES IN PLACE, WE
 WILL SEE THESE SHOWERS MEETING
 TODAY AND TOMORROW AND EVEN
 FRIDAY, WE LOOK AT RAIN AND
 COOLER TEMPERATURES, WE TOP OUT
 AT 74 YESTERDAY IN DC FOR
 RECORD TEMPERATURES AND THAT
 WILL NOT BE THE CASE TODAY.
 40 TO 55 DEGREES IS THE RANGE,
 SHOWERS OUT THERE AND CLOUDY
 WITH WINDS OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST
 AT AROUND FIVE MILES PER HOUR
 AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
 THIS LOOKS LIKE BY THE HOUR,
 BECAUSE THE RAIN IS GOING TO BE
 MOVING IN THIS AFTERNOON.
 2:00 FROM NORTHERN AND WESTERN
 SUBURBS AND RIGHT ON 5:00 IS
 BEST TIME TO SEE THE RAIN
 ACROSS METRO DC.
 THIS IS AT 2:30 PM, WE CAN SEE
 THE RAIN AROUND FREDERICK AND
 MARTINSBURG AND WINCHESTER AND
 EVEN THROUGH LEESBURG AND BY
 6:00 THIS EVENING, WE LOOK AT
 LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN AT 6:00
 IN THE DC METRO AREA.
 WE HAVE THE YELLOW WEATHER
 ALERT FOR THE DRIVE HOME,
 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
 WE ISSUED THIS BECAUSE OF THE
 TIMING OF IT.
 WE GET THE RAIN ON THE ROADS
 AND THAT COULD CAUSE SOME
 PROBLEMS FOR US.
 ADVANCING TO 8:00 THIS EVENING
 AT DURING THE DINNER HOURS, YOU
 ARE STILL LOOKING AT RAIN OUT
 THERE.
 TOMORROW MORNING, ALSO LOOKING
 AT A WET COMMUTE IN THE
 MORNING, BUT IN THE EVENING, WE
 GET A BREAK FROM THE SHOWERS.
 WE WAKE UP THURSDAY MORNING
 WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 50s
 AND 40s AND LIGHT RAIN AS YOU
 GET ABOUT YOUR DAY, BUT IN THE
 AFTERNOON, WE HAVE A LITTLE
 BREAK IN THE RAIN BEFORE IT
 RETURNS AGAIN ON FRIDAY.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE ELSE WE
 SEE THIS ON FRIDAY, STRONG COLD
 FRONT COMES TO THE AREA, THIS
 IS THE FORECAST THAT I INVITED,
 YOU CAN SEE WE ARE IN THE 60s
 AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN DC, BUT
 ONCE THE STRONGER AIR COMES IN,
 TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO DROP
 THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON FRIDAY
 SUMMER, SO 60 START AND BY
 FRIDAY AFTERNOON, WE HAVE THE
 JACKET AND TEMPERATURES
 GRADUALLY BEGIN TO FALL TO THE
 50s AND 40s, SO BEHIND THAT
 COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY, 39
 DEGREES ON SATURDAY AND
 SATURDAY HAS 41 BY SUNDAY AND
 THIS IS GOING TO START THE
 COMEBACK OF THE WINTER.
 WINTER WEATHER WILL BE MAKING
 ITS WAY BACK INTO THE FORECAST
 AND ON MONDAY MORNING, WE LOOK
 AT A CHANCE FOR RAIN AND SNOW.
 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE TREND
 I'VE SEEN WITH THE MODELS OVER
 THE PAST FEW DAYS BECAUSE THERE
 HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETE
 AGREEMENT.
 IN THE GFS MODEL, I'VE SEEN
 RAIN AND SNOW LINE SHIFTING A
 LITTLE FURTHER NORTH, AND THAT
 WOULD PUT US IN A MOSTLY RAIN
 EVENT ACROSS DC AND RAIN AND
 SNOW AS YOU HEAD TOWARDS
 NORTHERN MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND
 ALONG THE MARYLAND AND
 PENNSYLVANIA BORDER.
 WE WILL KEEP THE CHANCE FOR
 RAIN AND SNOW MIXED IN DC FOR 5
 AM MONDAY AND BY MONDAY
 AFTERNOON, WE SEE ALL RAIN
 ACROSS THE AREA AS WE GET TO
 WARMER AIR WITH WHEN COMING IN
 FROM THE SOUTH.
 TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY, WE HAVE
 ANOTHER SHOT OF SEEING SOME
 WINTER-LIKE WEATHER AROUND
 HERE.
 RAIN AND SNOW MIXED POSSIBLE
 TUESDAY I'M, TUESDAY BY
 MIDMORNING, WE HAVE THE
 CHANGEOVER TO ALL SNOW BY
 WEDNESDAY AT SOME POINT.
 THERE IS STILL TIME TO FIND TO
 THE FORECAST, BUT THIS IS WHAT
 WE ARE LOOKING AT.
 WE GOT SPOILED YESTERDAY WITH
 TEMPERATURES IN THE 70s AND NOW
 IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL SEE
 WINTER REARING ITS HEAD ONCE
 AGAIN ACROSS THE AREA.
 AT 8 PM, WE SEE ARENA STOMACHS
 AROUND THE AREA, ESPECIALLY OFF
 TO THE WEST.
 THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST LOOKS
 LIKE THIS, 53 DEGREES TODAY AND
 65 TOMORROW AND STILL SOME
 SHOWERS OUT THERE, 64 DEGREES
 AND FALLING TEMPERATURES ON
 FRIDAY, AND THEN WHEN THEY
 FALL, THEY COME CRASHING DOWN
 THE TEMPERATURES AROUND 39
 DEGREES BY SATURDAY.
 MICK WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF
 ACCIDENTS PICKING UP OUT THERE.
 WE'VE ALREADY HAD A FEW
 CLOSURES THIS MORNING.
 SUSAN PARKWAY IS BACK OPEN AND
 WE LOOK AT FOUR VEHICLES
 INVOLVED IN A CRASH ON DC 295
 SOUTHBOUND BY EAST CAPITOL
 STREET.
 THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY
 ARE ON THE SHOULDER AND DELAYS
 ARE GROWING BACK TO ROUTE 50.
 IF YOU ARE IN ST. MARY'S THIS
 MORNING, ROUTE 5 IS CLOSED
 SOUTHBOUND AND THERE ARE
 PICTURES OF THE SCENE, YOU CAN
 SEE THE DELAYS.
 THE ACCIDENT IS BETWEEN
 MECHANICSVILLE ROAD AND THREE
 NOTCH ROAD, IT LOOKS LIKE A
 COMMUTER BUS THAT MAY HAVE
 Val, Vern... I'm off to college and I'm not gonna be around...
  I'm worried about my parents'  retirement.
         Oh, don't worry.
  Voya helps them to and through  retirement...
     ...dealing with today's     expenses...
        ...like college...
  ...while helping plan, invest  and protect for the future.
  So they'll be okay... without  me?
              Um...
    And when we knock out this    wall...
    imagine the closet space.
        Yes! Oh hey, son.
  Yeah, I think they'll be fine.
    Voya. Helping you to and    through retirement.
 THE TOUR IS EXPECTED TO MAKE TOURS IN NEW ZEALAND AND
 AUSTRALIA AND SRI LANKA.
 FACEBOOK IS ROLLING OUT THE
 UNSEND A MESSAGE FOR IOS AND
 ANDROID.
 TO DELETE A MESSAGE FROM A
 SINGLE OR GROUP CHAT, ALL YOU
 HAVE TO DO IS TAP ON THE
 MESSAGE YOU WANT TO DELETE AND
 THEN CHOOSE THE OPTION LABELED
 DELETE FOR EVERYONE.
 SO THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS A
 GOOD OR BAD IDEA.
 THIS IS SIMILAR TO TWITTER
 CONSIDERING THE DELETE OR EDIT
 TWEET BUTTON, THERE IS A
 CONCERN OVER WHETHER OR NOT YOU
 SHOULD BE ABLE TO DELETE OR
 EDIT IT.
 I THINK IT'S NOTHING BUT A
 GOOD IDEA, WHO HASN'T SENT A
 MESSAGE THAT THEY REGRET?
 IT GIVES YOU 10 MINUTES TO SEND
 WHATEVER MESSAGE YOU WANT TO
 SEND AND THEN YOU'RE LIKE OH,
 MY BAD, JUST PULL IT BACK.
 10 MINUTES IS YOUR WINDOW.
 ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU GET?
 I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS 10
 MINUTES COMING UP WITH GMAIL,
 YOU COULD DO THAT WITH 30
 SECONDS TO RETRACT YOUR

 BUT THIS IS FACEBOOK, DO YOU
 EVEN TRUST IT?
 30 SECONDS IS NOT LONG
 ENOUGH.
 YOU HAVE TO LET IT FULLY

 AM I GOING TO GET FIRED FOR

 THE STATE OF THE UNION AND I
 WILL WEIGH IN ON MY FINAL
 THOUGHTS.

 THE PRESIDENT GIVES HIS SECOND STATE OF THE UNION

 UNITY, BUT DEMOCRATS HIT BACK
 SAYING THE PROBLEM WITH UNITY
 IS HIS FAULT.
