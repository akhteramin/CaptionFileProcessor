 WHAT A FLY.
 IT ALL STARTS TONIGHT, FINAL
 FOUR.
 ALSO, EASTERN CONFERENCE END
 GAME AND A BUG ON A WINDSHIELD.
 THE BUG ON THE WINDSHIELD WHICH
 MAKES ME THINK OF THE TITLE ON
 THEHIELD.
 WHO'S GOT IT?
 STICK TO IT.
 I'M THE WINDSHIELD, NOT THE
 BUG.
 I GET THAT.
 TONY:GHT THROUGH THIS.
 MILWAUKEE LOCKING DOWN BEST
 RECORD IN HOME THROUGHOUT.
 EVERYTHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.
 BLEDSOE AND EMBIID.
 AND GIANNIS.■■CZ#■■
 AND YOU PEOPLE LOVE THE GAMES.
 IF PHILLY HAD WON -BILL, WHAT
 WAS THE STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE?
 THE BUCKS ARE GOING TO BE
 TOUGH THIS POST-SEASON.
 I LOVE THE POST-SEASON AND
 GIANNIS' FOUR BLOCKS OF EMBIID.
 DESPITE OF THEIR INJURIES, THEY
 ARE NOT GOING INTO THIS LIKE
 THEY ARE SCARED.
 THEY ARE ACTING LIKE THEY
 BELONG.
 TONY: WOODY PAIGE, HOW ABOUT
 YOU?
 THEY ARE GOING TO BE VERY
 TOUGH IN THE POST-SEASON.
 TONY: THEY SHOULD.
 THEY HAVE THE BEST RECORD.
 GIVE ME SOMETHING MORE, COME ON,
 WOODY.
 WHAT KIND OF STATEMENT DID
 THEY MAKE?
 IF THEY PLAY PHILADELPHIA AGAIN,
 THE 76ERS ARE NOT GOING TO STEP
 BACK OR DOWN, BUT ARE GOING TO
 BE A TOUGH TEAM IN THAT SERIES
 AND WITH THE HOME-COURT
 ADVANTAGE THROUGHOUT THE
 PLAYOFFS, IF THEY GET TO THE
 TIMES, IT WILL CREATE PROBLEMS
 FOR THE WARRIORS.
 THEY HAVE SURVIVED THE INJURIES.
 THEY STILL HAVE A FEW.
 GIANNIS, M.V.P. OF THE LEAGUE AS
 FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THIS IS A
 TEAM THAT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH
 TO CONFRONT.
 TONY: YOU SAY GIANNIS LOCKED
 DOWN THE M.V.P.
 THE FACT THAT WE ARE SAYING
 THESE NUMBERS.
 40-SOMETHING.
 FIVE, SIX.
 SARAH, WHAT WAS THE STATEMENT
 FROM LAST NIGHT?
 THING TO BE FAIR, OTHERWISE,
 WE SAY IT'S A REGULAR SEASON
 GAME AND DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
 THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE BUCKS
 IS ONE THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING ALL
 SEASON BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS
 BOUGHT.
 IF THE CELTICS' TALENT COULD BE
 MADE UP BY GETTING TOGETHER,
 THEY WOULD BE THE FAVORITE.
 SOME BELIEVE THE RAPTORS ARE THE
 FAVORITE.
 THE BUCKS HAVE BEEN THE BEST
 TEAM.
 THE INJURIES ARE THE ONLY THING
 THAT COULD SLOW THEM DOWN.
 HOME COURT ADVANTAGE.
 THEY GET TO PLAY AT HOME IN
 THOSE EARLY ROUNDS.
 THE STATEMENT IS, WHERE HAVE
 YOU BEEN.
 AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT BLEDSOE
 INITIATED THIS.
 HE PUSHED HIM OFF AND THREW THE
 BALL BACK AT HIM.
 AND THE REASON WHY THE INJURY,
 IS GEORGE HILL HAS COME BACK OUT
 OF NOWHERE AND SCORED 60 POINTS
 IN THE LAST TWO GAMES.
 WHO KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE
 [HORN]S POINT.■■■■■
 TONY: GIANNIS CLINCH IT M.V.M.?
 HIS BLOCK WITH EMBIID DID IT.
 AND HE DOES EVERYTHING.
 TONY: THE BLOCK ON EMBIID.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT WAS
 KEEPING HARDEN WAS THE ABILITY
 TO DO THE THINGS HE HAS HAD TO
 DO TO GO FROM 11TH IN THE WEST.
 30-PLUS-POINT GAMES.
 THERE IS AN ASTER RISK ON THAT,
 AS TO WHO COULD HAVE DONE THAT
 AS WELL.
 GIANNIS IS THE BEST PLAYER WITH
 THE BEST RECORD.
 ANYONE WHOSE TURN IT IS, --
 TONY: WHOA.
 WHOA.

 NO.

 LAST WORD FOR YOU.
 GOT ALL THE NUMBERS.
 EVERYTHING HAPPENED THERE.
 THAT BEING ON THE ROAD WAS AIG■
 FINAL FOURS TURN
 AUBURN-GEORGIA TEXAS TECH
 AND VA STATE.  SOUNDS LIKE A MO
 'T ACQUIREx NREITZ.
 NUMBER ONE DEFENSE VERSUS HAVING
 A COACH WHO HAS BEEN THERE
 BEFORE, WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT,
 SARAH?
 WE HAVE UNDERESTIMATED TECH
 SINCE THE BEGINNING.
 THEY WERE PREDICTED TO FINISH
 AND DIDN'T GET A VOTE.
 THEY HAVE DONE TWO OTHER TEAMS
 WHAT WE DIDN'T EXPECT OVER AND
 OVER.
 JUST BECAUSE MICHIGAN STATE
 HASN'T LOST SINCE EARLY MARCH,
 WE SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT TEXAS
 TECH TAKES THEM DOWN.
 THE PRESSURE OF THE FINAL FOUR
 AND HAVING A COACH LIKE IZZO.
 I THINK THE WELL-ROUNDED TEAM
 COMES OUT ON TOP.
 TONY: NUMBER ONE DEFENSE IN THE
 COUNTRY VERSUS A COACH WHO HAS
 CHAMPIONSHIPS AND LIVES IN THE
 FINAL FOUR, WHAT IS MORE
 IMPORTANT?
 TO ME, IT'S IZZO BUT FOR THE
 REASONS OF ADJUSTMENT.
 I ASKED THEM ABOUT THE GAME IN
 D.C. AND I SAID YOU WON THIS
 GAME WINNING SIX THREE THROWS.
 IZZO IS THE GUY THAT WILL DO IT.
 I LIKE IZZO.
 BUT IN THIS GAME WITH THIS TEAM
 AND THE SENIOR WHO TURNS IT ON.
 TONY: ICE COLD FROM CLINTON
 YATES.
 NUMBER ONE DEFENSE, TEXAS TECH,
 THEIR EFFICIENCY IS BETTER THAN
 VIRGINIA.
 THEY CAN PLAY THAT SLOG
 BASKETBALL VERSUS MICHIGAN STATE
 AND HOW ROUNDED THEY ARE.
 THIS IS STILL ABOUT THE
 PLAYERS.
 TEXAS TECH IS GOING TO WIN THIS
 GAME.
 THEY HELD THE FOUR NCAA
 OPPONENTS.
 AND THEY CUT OFF WINSTON AND CUT
 OFF THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE.
 THAT'S HOW THEY BEAT MICHIGAN
 STATE.
 MOONY IS A GREAT DEFENDER.
 AND TEXAS TECH.
 TONY: YOU HAVE TEXAS TECH.
 DEFENSE TRAVELS, THAT'S THE
 EXPRESSION.
 AND YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE
 KEY HERE, WOODY, HOW ABOUT YOU?
 OFFENSE TRAVELS, THE
 DEFENSIVE TEAM GETS THE BALL.
 I'M GOING TO TAKE TOM IZZO, 1B
 WOULD BE HAMILTON.
 HAMILTON HAS MUCH EFFECT ON THE
 FLOOR AS IZZO DOES ON OFF THE
 FLOOR.
 HE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON.
 HE PROVIDED 50% OF THE ASSISTS
 ON THEIR BASKETS.
 AND I LIKE WHAT HE DOES
 DEFENSIVELY AND OFFENSIVELY.1
 [HORN]
 TONY: WINSTON.
 IT'S OK.
 THAT WAS Ay TURNOVER.
 WE STILL GOT MORE SHOW TO GO.
 AUBURN AND VIRGINIA.
 AND SLOG VERSUSG, WOODY,
 PICK UP THE PIECES.
 FOR AUBURN TO WIN, WH■■ TO
 HAPPEN?
 FOR VIRGINIA TO, WHAT NEEDS  HA?
 IN THE CASE OF AUBURN, THEY
 HAVE TO SET THE PACE.
 WE KNOW ABOUT VIRGINIA WANTS TO
 SLOW IT DOWN.
 IF AUBURN GETS AHEAD, VIRGINIA
 CAN'T COME BACK.
 EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN
 A CHAMPION AND TO THE FINAL
 FOUR, I LOVE THE COACH.
 HE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WHEN HE
 LEFT TENNESSEE, BUT HE HAS COME
 BACK AND PROVED HE CAN COACH
 GUYS DOWN THERE.
 AND MISSING THEIR BEST PLAYER.
 HARPER CAME THROUGH LAST WEEK.
 PUT HIM ON THE FREE-THROW LINE,
 IF YOU ARE VIRGINIA, YOU ARE NOT
 GOING TO WIN THE GAME.
 VIRGINIA'S DEFENSE IS NOT GOING
 TO ABLE TO SLOW DOWN AUBURN.
 AND SHE SHOOT THREE-POINTERS
 BETTER THAN ANY TEAM AND THEY
 ALL SHOOT THEM.
 EVEN THE GUYS WHO CAN'T SHOOT
 THEM.
 TONY: YOU ARE GOING WITH THE
 OFFENSE OVER THE DEFENSE.
 HOW ABOUT YOU?
 I'M GOING WITH U.V.A.
 THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THE PACE
 AND WHETHER THEY CAN STAY IN THE
 TOURNAMENT AND MANAGED TO GET
 PAST IT.
 MAYBE THE FIRST TIME WHEN
 BENNETT IS RUNNING THIS STYLE
 THEY HAVE A CORE OF THREE
 PLAYERS TO TURN IT ON.
 THEY DON'T HAVE TO REST ON THEIR
 FUNDAMENTALS AND SLOW IT DOWN.
 THEY CAN TAKE JEROME, GUY AND
 HUNTER, THEY ARE SHOOTING 40%
 FROM THREE AND COMBINE IT WITH
 THEIR SOLID DEFENSE.
 AND BOTH SIDES KIND OF GUY AND
 AUBURN DEPENDS ON THE OFFENSE
 AND HITTING THREES.
 IF THEIR THREE-POINT SHOOTING
 GOES DOWN, VIRGINIA CAN TAKE THE
 LEAD AND NOT GIVE IT BACK.
 THE OTHER THING THAT HUNTER
 HAS BEEN REASONABLE,, AUBURN CAN
 KEEP THAT GUY IN THE FRONTCOURT,
 THEY HAVE A CHANCE.
 FOR VIRGINIA TO WIN, CLARK HAS
 BEEN A DEFENSIVE FORCE FOR THEM.
 IF HE CAN FIND A WAY TO GET INTO
 THIS GAME AND GET CLUTCH SHOTS.
 HE IS A BIT OF A CONSTANT.
 TONY: HAD ONE OF THE GREAT
 PASSES.
 HE IS PLAYING IN THIS
 TOURNAMENT.
 WE HAVE A COUPLE FOR VIRGINIA,
 ONE FOR AUBURN.
 YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW GREAT
 DEFENSE IS FOR TEXAS TECH.
 VIRGINIA IS RIGHT THERE.
 AUBURN HAS A GREAT DEFENSE
 AND AUBURN HAS SHOOTERS.
 THE SECOND-MOST THREE-POINT
 SHOOTERS OUTSIDE OF VILLANOVA.
 AUBURN IS LIKE THE VILLANOVA,
 NONE NBA GUYS AND ALL SHOOT
 THREES.
 BACKUP CENTER SHOT A THREE.
 THEY WILL ALL COME OUT FIRING.
 VIRGINIA CANNOT CATCH UP, THEY
 CANNOT COME BACK.
 [HORN]
 WHICH GUY ARE YOU GOING TO
 GET IT?
 YOU KNOW FOR VIRGINIA TO SURVIVE
 THEY HAVE TO GET GUYS SHOOTING
 THREE-POINTERS.
 IT'S ABOUT THAT GAME?
 GUY WAS SO OPEN ABOUT THE
 ANXIETY HE EXPERIENCED AFTER THE

 I THOUGHT THAT WAS HEARTFELT AND
 OPEN WITH HIS WEDDING REGISTRY.
 IS HE GOING TO LOCK IT DOWN?
 LET'S LOOK AT THOSE SCORES.■■■/>
  These days we're all stressed.
        I hear you, sister.
   Stress can affect our minds.
    I call this dish, "Stress."
    Stress can also affect our              bodies.
 So, I'm partnering with Cigna to   remind you that your emotional
   and physical health are more     connected than you think.
  Go in for your annual check-up.
   And be open with your doctor     about anything you feel.
          Body and Mind.
   Cigna. Together, all the way.
          That's better.

 WELCOME BACK TO "AROUND THá■W DECK OF PIER 17.
 TONY: FOR TWO STRAIGHT YEARS,
 TONIGHT IS AN ALL-TIME MOMENT IN
 TH INVOL@■;■/° UCONN LOSING AND
 TURN TO■CONN-NOTER AND THE
 PRESSURE ONlHAT HAS BE■
 AND WHAT CAN BE AND WILL BE THE
 PATH TO HOW THIS ONE IS DECIDED.
 BILL, START US OFF.
 THIS COULD BE THE BEST GAME
 OF ANY COLLEGE BASKETBALL
 TOURNAMENT GAME, MUST-SEE TV.
 I'M GOING WITH NOTRE DAME.
 FOUR OF THE FIVE STARTERS WERE
 ON THE FLOOR LAST YEAR AND WON
 THE TITLE WITH THE BUZZER
 BEATER.
 WILLIAMS, FRESHMAN, ONE OF THE
 BEST PLAYERS HASN'T BEEN HERE.
 I GO WITH THE VETERAN.
 TONY: WOODY.
 I AGREE WITH BILL WITH NOTRE
 DAME WINNING.
 THE FIFTH PLAYER WAS A STARTER
 TWO YEARS AGO.
 COMPLETELY BETTER TEAM.
 I DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT
 WILLIAMS.
 NO LONGER A FRESHMAN AND HAS
 COME ON.
 I GO ON WHO HAD THE GAME-WINNING
 SHOT AND GOING TO BREAK THE
 ALL-TIME SCORING RECORD.
 TONY: HOW ABOUT YOU?
 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, BUT WE
 HAVE SEEN THEM FALL IN THE FINAL
 FOUR AND NOTER TEAM IS SO
 CLUTCH.
 THEY HAVE THE EDGE OVER UCONN IN
 TOURNAMENT GAMES.
 IT COMES TO PRESSURE AND WHO
 HANDLES IT.
 AND TWO OF THE MOST CLUTCH SHOTS
 IN TOURNAMENT HISTORY.
 ALL FIVE OF THEIR STARTERS
 AVERAGE IN DOUBLE DIGITS.
 THEY'RE GOOD.
 UCONN GOING TO DO IS SHOOTING
 THREES.
 THAT'S THE ONLY THING THEY CAN
 DO.
 TONY: BILL'S POINT THAT NOTRE
 DAME RETURNS ON THE FLOOR FROM
 LAST YEAR'S GAME.
 UCONN RETURNS THREE.
 HOW THEY BOUNCED BACK.
 THEY WON.
 TONY: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
 MOTI
 IF YOU AREN'T MOTIVATED, YOU GET
 IN THE MOOD.
 THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
 UCONN TO ESTABLISH THE LEGACY.
 OREGON AND BAYLOR.
 OREGONq■■ WINS IF■ PLANK, BAYLO
 WINS IF BLANCHING.
 WOODY, DO YOU WANT TO WRAP YOUR
 ARMS AROUND THAT?
 SHOOTING THREE-POINTERS.
 BUT THEIR BACKUP IS THE
 PICK-AND-ROLL.
 AND WON'T PULL IT OFF AGAINST
 BAYLOR, BECAUSE THEY HAVE GIVEN
 UP 22.8 POINTS PER GAME INSIDE
 THE ARC.
 WHEN YOU PUT THE BROWN AND COX
 ON THE INSIDE, IT IS DIFFICULT
 -IF THEY PLAY WELL, BAYLOR IS
 GOING TO WIN BIG.
 THIS IS A FASCINATING GAME,
 BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GOOD INSIDE
 THE PAINT, 52 POINTS INSIDE THE
 PAINT AGAINST IOWA.
 THEY DOMINATE INSIDE.
 BUT OREGON DOESN'T NEED TO
 DOMINATE.
 13 THREES IN THE LAST WIN.
 THIRD IN THE NATION IN FIELD
 GOAL PERCENTAGE.
 SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT STYLE.
 BAYLOR HAS POUNDED EVERYONE
 BEFORE THIS.
 IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE FOR OREGON
 TO WIN.
 THEY LEAD THE NATION IN
 THREE-POINT PERCENTAGE, NOT WHAT
 THEY DO.

 ERIN IS THE KEY.
 THEY MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE.
 SABRINA IS THE BEST PLAYER ON
 THE FLOOR AND I THINK BAYLOR IS
 NOT CAREFUL OF DEFENDING THE
 THREE-POINT SHOTS.
 TONY: BUY OR SELL THREE.
 WHO SAID THIS, MIKE MCCARTHY  Ry
 AARON RODGERS HASN'T RESPONDED
 TO THE CLAIM OF BROW BEATING AND
 GRUDGE HOLDING.
 WHO CAME OFF LOOKING WORSE?
 I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME.
 THE GUY WHO WAS NOT TALENTED AND
 I'M TAKING THE ONE THAT GOT AN
 UPSIDE AND THAT IS AARON
 RODGERS.
 RODGERS FOR SURE.
 HIS REPUTATION WAS NOT THE
 GREATEST AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
 PUBLICLY.
 THIS DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING.
 I DON'T THINK ANYONE WILL
 REMEMBER MIKE MCCARTY.
 RODGERS COMES OFF AS A JERK.
 THE JERK CAN STILL PLAYS.
 MAKE IT UNANIMOUS.
 RODGERS PLAYED WITH INJURY AND
 MCCARTY HAS THAT ONE GREAT
 MOMENT IN THE SUPER BOWL AND
 OTHERWISE THOUGH HASN'T
 PERFORMED WELL AS A COACH.
 TONY: BUY OR SELL FOUR, RED SOX.
 57 OF THE 70 INNINGS.
 THEY TRAILED FOR 81% OF THE
 INNINGS.
 THE ASTROS-YANKEES, WORKING TO
 GET WINS.
 WHOSE START IS MORE OF A WINDOW?
 THE YANKEES.
 THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND YEAR.
 HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW
 EVERY SINGLE THING HE IS DOING.
 I'M WORRIED.
 THE CUBS.
 THEY WALKED.
 YOU HAVE TO GET THE BULLPEN
 FIXED.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT.
 STARTING PITCHING WITH ONE
 PARTICULAR GUY, I DON'T THINK
 THE CUBS ARE OUTFITTED TO BE
 EVEN THE THIRD BEST TEAM IN THAT
 DIVISION.
 TONY: A LOT OF MUSIC COMING YOUR
 WAY, SARAH.
 I FEEL GREAT ABOUT THE CUBS.
 WHEN BILL SAYS THEY ARE IN
 TROUBLE I AM NO LONGER WORRIED
 ABOUT THE CUBS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 YANKEES AND TAKE THIS SMALL
 SAMPLE SIZE, WE THINK THE
 ORIOLES AND MARINERS ARE WINNING
 IT ALL.
 THE YANKEES HAVE THE MOST
 TROUBLE.
 INJURIES, 11-MEN ON THEIR 40-MAN
 ROSTER.■■■■■■■■■
