 I'LL GET TO HALFTIME.
 MIKE: YOU AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS

 TONY: I GUARANTEE YOU I'LL GET

 I'M NOT MAKING PROMISES OF THAT.
 WELCOME TO "P.T.I.," BOYS AND

 IN TODAY'S EPISODE, TEXAS TECH
 ROLLS ON, NICK SABAN WANTS
 PLAYERS TO STAY, AND NOTRE DAME
 LOSES A HEARTBREAKER.
 WE START TODAY WITH THE■/■■
 UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HEADING

 IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, THE
 CRITICAL PLAY IS KYLE GUY MAKING
 THE JUMP SHOT DEEP IN THE RIGHT
 CORNER THAT GETS THEM INTO A
 ONE-POSSESSION SITUATION.
 I JUST THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY
 REMARKABLE THAT THEY'RE THERE.
 I THINK THEY DESERVE IT TOO,
 BECAUSE THEY EXECUTED WHEN THEY
 HAD TO.
 MIKE: TWI

             NGS THATHEM TO WIN.p BUT IF I WAS PURDUE,■z■z■zWERE

 ■ NIGHT IN■■IFAS
 LOOKING DOWN AT CHARLES,
 WHO WAS ON A SET THEY USED
 HALFTIME, PREGAME AND POSTGAME.
 I SAID, I FEEL BAD FOR YOU.
 I FELT GREAT FOR VIRGINIA.
 VIRGINIA HAS NOTHING TO
 APOLOGIZE ABOUT, BUT I FEEL BAD
 FOR AUBURN KIDS IN THAT
 POSITION.
 VIRGINIA, WERE, WAS UP 10 LATE
 IN THAT GAME.
 YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO
 ROLL, AND THEY DIDN'T.
 THESE GAMES ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
 NO UPSETS, BUT GAMES ARE
 EAT.
 THEY ARE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 VIRGINIA IS IN AFTER A SECOND
 STRAIGHT MIRACLE FINISH, AND
 MIGHT NEED ANOTHER ONE TO GET
 PAST RELENTLESS TEXAS N
 THE NCAA TITLE GAME TONIGHT.
 A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD
 TECH WINNING THE THING FROM THE
 BEGINNING.
 TONY: NOT MANY.
 MIKE: THE RED-HAIRED PULLED AWAD
 AWAY FROM MICHIGAN STATE.
  IS BASICALLY A VEGAS PICK
 'EM.
 TIME FOR YOU TO MAN UP.
 WHO YOU GOT?
 TONY: VIRGINIA HAS HAD
 UNBELIEVABLE HOUDINI-LIKE■v■v G
 DUKE HAD THAT SAME THING8v AGAIT
  AND VIRGINIA TECH.
 THEN MICHIGAN STATE KNOCKED THE■
 OFF.
 YOU MIGHT FAVOR TEXASXz T
 ■v■v■v■v■v■z■vnz
 TOURNAMENT.■v■vRENCE IS VIRGINIR
 THIS REASON.
 NO NUMBER R LOST TO
 A 16 B
  BACK THE NEXT YEAR WITH
 ESSENTIALLY THE SAME TEAM, THE
 SAME TEAM, AND WIN THE WHOLE
 THING,■v■vHAT WOULD BEC.8v8v■u
 : YOU COULD WRITE BOOKS
 ABOUT THAT.
 MIKE: I WISH I COULD SEE ANY
 SCENARIO TONIGHT, SEE TEXAS TECH
 WINNING A CLOSE ONE, I COULD SEE
 VIRGINIA WINNING A CLOSE ONE.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S A BLOWOUT BY
 THE WAY THEY PLAY, THEY'RE SO
 DELIBERATE, AND THE DEFENSES ARE
 SO GREAT.
 TONY: I'D BE SURPRISED IF EITHER
 TEAM SCORES 70.
 I THINK VIRGINIA WINSOUT 70, BUó
 COMFORTABLY.
 THEY PLAY FREELY TONIGHT, WITH
 THE BEST PLAYER IN TY JEROME■v■N
 THE FLOOR.
 TONY: I THINK THEY'RE FULLY
 REDEEMED IF THEY WIN.
 MIKE: YOU DON'T MAKE DUKE WIN
 THE FINAL GAME■z■zTONY: TO B FUU
 HAVE TO WIN THE WHOLE THING.
 TEXAS TECH IS A RELENTLESS
 DEFENSIVE TEAM.
 THEY'RE A TEAM BUILT JUST FOR■v.
 TO ME GRAD TRANSFERS ARE
 QUARTERBACKS WHO GO SOMEWHERE
 ELSE IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL,
 BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SO GOOD YOU GO
 TO THE NBA.
 IT'S AN INTERESTING TEAM.
 I COULD SEE THEM WINNING, BUT TO
 ME VIRGINIA IS THE MORE COMPLETE
 BETTER TEAM.
 MIKE: I AGREE WITH THAT.
 TEXAS TECH, JARRETT CULVER DID
 NOT HAVE A GAME, I THINK HE WAS
 3-12 IN THE SEMI AGAINST
 MICHIGAN STATE.
 THAT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.
 HE'LL PLAY TONIGHT.
 TONY: BY THE WAY, TEXAS TECH IS
  FOOTBALL SCHOOL.
 FOOTBALL SCHOOLS HAVE WON MORE.
 OHIO STATE A FOOTBALL SCHOOL,
 FLORIDA IS A FOOTBALL SCHOOL.
 WHAT VIRGINIA COULD DO HAS NEVER
 BEEN DONE.
 MIKE: YES.
 TONY: IT'S A GRANDEUR STORY IS
 WHAT I'M SAYING.
 NICK SABAN IS CONCERNED AND
 ANGRY THAT SEVEN OF HIS
 UNDERCLASSMEN HAVE DECLARED FOR
 THE NFL DRAFT.
 HE WANTS TO BE SURE THAT YOU
 UNDERSTAND HE'S NOT AGAINST THE
 NFL.
 YOU GO TO ALABAMA TO GO TO THE
 NFL, BUT WHAT SABAN SAYS IS WAIT
 UNTIL YOU CAN MAXIMIZE YOUR
 OPPORTUNITY.
 SABAN SAID, QUOTE, WE HAVE GUYS
 WITH NO DRAFT GRADES,
 SEVENTH-ROUND GRADES,
 FIFTH-ROUND GRADES, GOING OUT IN
 THE DRAFT, AND THE PLAYER LOSES.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT FOR THE
 DRAFT EARLY.
 YOU CAN COME BACK AND PLAY,
 UNQUOTE.
 DO YOU BELIEVE SABAN HAS THEPLAT
 HEART?
 MIKE: AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
 IT'S00( PROVEN.
 I DON'T BELIEVE MUCH NICK SABAN
 SAYS ABOUT ANYTHING.
 FIRST OF ALL, THE PROOF IS IN
 THE PUDDING WHICH IS THE DR
 D THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS NICK
 HE HAS MORE PLAYER GOING TO THE
 NFL EVERY YEAR ESSENTIALLY THE
 ■ OR■(!■THAN ANYBODY.
 THAT INCLUDES OHIO STATE AND
 SOUTHERN CAL AND PENN STATE.
  SABAN PUTS MORE OF HISS
 IN THE NFL.
 IF YOU'RE ONE OF HIS GUYS,
 YOU'RE A PARENT, GUARDIAN,
 TEACHER OR ADVISOR, YOU MIGHT
 WANT TO SAY DON'T TALK TO ME,
 TELL ME WHAT THIS NUMBER MEANS.
 NICK SABAN'S GUYS IN THE N■z■z■.
 TONY:■v■v■v■v■v■v>y>y8v TERRIBLv
 THE WAY HE DELIVERS A MESSAGE,
 AND AS A FOOTBALL■v HE WANTS
 XvIS SELFISH. DOES.
 I ALSO THINK■LOT OF HIS
 PUBLIC STATEMENTS ARE CORRECT.■.
 THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS ON
 DEFENSE ALONE HAVE EIGHT GUYS
 FROM ALABAMA.
 IF NICK SABAN SAYS TO YOU, SON,
 I THINK YOU SHOULD WAIT ONE MORE
 YEAR, I'M GOING TO LISTEN.
 MIKE: IF YOU DON'T, YOU
 SHOULDN'T BE EARTH ANGRY AT HIM.
 TONY: I DON'T THINK MANY[z■v■v D

 IS ACCURATE.

 MIKE: THIS LESS THAN NO DEAL IN

 I DON'T CARE.
 TONY: WELL, YOU DON'T CARE.
 MIKE: PEOPLE DON'T CARE.
 I JUST LEFT MINNEAPOLIS.
 NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE

 THIS.
 TONY: MIKE, THESE ARE NOT LAWS.
 THESE ARE NCAA RULES.
 THESE ARE NOT■■■■ L?OT THAT
 SISTANT COACHES ARE GOING TO

 SO SOMEBODY OUT THERE CARES.
 MY POINT IS SIMPLY THIS.ó
 IF YOU HAVE THE RULE, AND THEY
 DON'T ENFORCE THE R WHAT DO
 WE DO IT?
  SHOE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN
 SLIPPING MONEY TO PEOPLE FOR THE
 LAST 40 YEARS.
 TONY: YES, I DO BELIEVE THAT.
 WE TURN NOW TO THE WOMEN'S FINAL
  LAST NIGHT.
 BAYLOR BEAT NOTRE DAME IN WHAT
 BECAME A CLOSE GAME, DENYING
 NOTRE DAME THE CHANCE TO REPEAT
 AS NATIONAL CHAMPIONS.
 NOTRE DAME WAS DOWN TWO POINTS
 WITH 1.9 SECONDS TO PLAY WHEN
 ARIKE■OWALE STEPPED TO THE
 LINE, AND MADE THREE SHOTS.
 SHE WAS 33-36 FROM THE
 THIS TOURNAMENT.
 SHE MISSED THE FIRST.
 GAME OVER.
 HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN SHE
 MISSED?
 MIKE: I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER A
 STANDING OVATION.
 SHE WON HER A SCHOOL A NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP A YEAR AGO.
 SHE'S PLAYED VALIANTLY ALL T
 xSHE'S@@ GETTING A BRIB■ SHOE COMPANY, BUT
 PLAYED AS■■AYING COLLEGEñn BASK.

 BAYLORON THAT GAME.
 NOTRE DAME DIDN'T LOSE THAT
 GAME.
 BAYLOR WAS UP 17, AND NOTRE DAME
 CAME ROARING BACK AND TOOK THE
 LEAD, AND BAYLOR HAD CRITICAL
 BUCKETS.
 BAYLOR DID THE RIGHT.
 BAYLOR DID NOT FOLD UP.
 I'M LOOKING AT KIM MULKEY, WHO
 IS THE RARE PERSON WHO NOT ONLY
 WON NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP AS
 PLAYER.
 GOOD FOR THEM.
 ■O WAY, THEIR BEST PLAYER,
  COUT  MOST OF
 THE SECOND HALF.
 MIKE: SO BAYLOR HAS NOW INSERTED
 DAME.TCONN■!
  THINK THOSE THREE, AND
 OTHER SCHOOLS LIKE SOUTH
 CAROLINA, STANFORD, THEY'VE
 BUBBLED UP, BUT I THINK THESE
 THREE ARE AT THE TOP OF THE
 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PYRAMID.
 TONY: ILDN'T PUT NOTRE DAME
 AHEAD OF BAYLOR.
 MIKE: I SAID BAYLOR IS WITH
 UCONN, AND NOTRES S
 BELOW.
