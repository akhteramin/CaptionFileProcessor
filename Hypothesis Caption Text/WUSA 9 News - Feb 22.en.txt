 WHOLE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO
 BESIDE I AND YOU.
REPORTER: AN ACCOMPLISHED
 STYLUS, AND TRANSGENDER
 ACTIVIST, CONSULT WAS A VICTIM
 OF A CRIME, BACK IN 1990 BEFORE
 SHE TRANSITIONED.
 NEXT AND YOU KNOW, I SAW A
 BOTTLE GO TO MY HEAD, I TOOK
 COVER, I DID NOT FIGHT BACK,
 WHAT I DID, WAS JUST COVERED, I
 WENT INTO A FETAL POSITION,
 COVERED MY FACE, AND MY BODY,
 AND THEN, THEY JUST HIT ME, FOR
 15 TO 20 SECONDS, AND THAT IS
 WHY, I THINK, LIKE USING THAT
 STORY, IS SO HURTFUL TOWARDS
 OUR COMMUNITY, BECAUSE PEOPLE
 ARE GOING TO BE LIKE THAT DID
 NOT HAPPEN, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN,
 WHEN IN REALITY IT IS HAPPENING
 ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY, IF YOU
 WERE TO FESS UP AND TELL THE
 TRUTH, I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE
 MORE LENIENT WITH HIM, AND SAY
 YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS HUMAN, HE
 MADE A MISTAKE, A B FOR HIS
 CAREER, LIKE, BUT DO NOT HAVE
 HIS WHOLE CAREER AWAY.
 DOES HE NEED TO APOLOGIZE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 YES, HE DOES, BECAUSE AGAIN, IT
 IS TAKING TIME FROM REAL CRIMES
 THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR
 COMMUNITY.
REPORTER: AND THE BLACK
 COMMUNITY, BECAUSE HE PLAYS THE
 RECUT AS WELL.
 AND THAT IS THE FEAR REAL
 VICTIMS, MAY NOT BE BELIEVED IF
 SMALL IT STORY PROVES TO BE
 FALSE.

 INSTEAD OF THE MANDATED 180 DAY
 MINIMUM.
 HOWEVER, POST REPORTS THOSE
 SCHOOLS RETURN TO NORMAL
 SCHEDULES THIS FALL, THE MAYORS
 OF THE EXTENDED CALENDAR COULD
 NOT PROVE SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC
 IMPROVEMENT.
 THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM

 ARE LEAVING THE CLASSROOM.
 THE PEOPLE HURT THE MOST OF THE
 CHILDREN, OF THE LAST TWO
 MONTHS, MARCELLA ROBINSON HAS
 SPENT TIME AT THE ELEMENTARY
 SCHOOL IN NORTH -- LOOKING AT
 WHY THIS IS HAPPENING, AND
 ALONG THE WAY, SHE MET ONE
 INCREDIBLE TEACHER, WHO IS
 GIVING BACK IN IMMEASURABLE
 WAYS.
 WHEN I GET OLD, I FEEL LIKE
 I'M GOING TO SUCCEED IN LIFE,
 BECAUSE OF MR. DIAZ.
REPORTER: A TON ELEMENTARY,
 IS A SMALL SCHOOL.
 WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
 I NEVER REALLY, THOUGHT OF
 MYSELF AS A TEACHER.
 ESPECIALLY, WITH ALL THE
 NEGATIVITY ON THE NEWS YOU HEAR
 ABOUT TEACHERS, LOW SALARIES, A
 LOT OF TEACHERS SAYING THAT
 THEY DO NOT REALLY ENJOY THEIR
 JOB.
 IN THE ROUND, OF THE SPELLING
 BEE, RIGHT?
 THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.
REPORTER: BUT AS A BIG
 REPUTATION OF BEING LOW
 PERFORMING, THAT IS WHY WE
 SPENT THE LAST MONTH HERE,
 GETTING TO KNOW THE STUDENTS,
 THE TEACHERS.
 SCHOOL FOR VISIBLE PHYSICAL
 THERAPY, I WAS LOOKING FOR
 PHYSICAL THERAPY, I FELT LIKE
 THAT WAS MY CALLING.
REPORTER: MR. DIAZ ENDED UP
 LEAVING HIS PHYSICAL THERAPY
 PROGRAM, AFTER ANOTHER STUDENT
 CALLED HIM THE N-WORD.THAT
 EXPERIENCE WAS A TURNING POINT
 IN MY LIFE.
 AND, IT ALLOWED ME TO REALLY
 FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT I
 WANTED TO DO, THE THINGS THAT
 MADE ME HAPPY, AND YOU KNOW, MY
 PURPOSE, AND MY WIFE.
 OH, OKAY, BUT YOUR HOMEWORK
 ON YOUR DESK.
 AND, THAT IS HONESTLY WHAT
 BROUGHT ME TO TEACHING.
REPORTER: AND NOW, AT 26
 YEARS OLD, MR. DIAZ IS ONE OF
 THE MOST VETERAN TEACHERS AT A
 TIME ELEMENT APPEARED
 EVEN THOUGH IT IS HARD, YOU
 JUST QUIT, GIVE UP?
 NO!
 I WAS NAMED PRINCIPAL, AND I
 WAS COMING HERE, AND IT WAS LIKE
 NOTHING BUT BAD THINGS.
 LOWEST SCORES, KIDS OUT OF
 CONTROL, SCHOOL OUT OF CONTROL,
 PARENTS, ALWAYS YOU KNOW,
 FUSSING AND FIGHTING WITH THE
 STAFF.
 AT SO, I JUST HEARD THAT IT WAS
 A REALLY HARD PLACE, REALLY
 ROUGH.
 AND, THE YOU KNOW, SOME CHANGES
 NEED TO HAPPEN.
 SAY IT NOW.
 NOT!
REPORTER: 44% OF THE TEACHERS
 TURN OVER EACH YEAR AT A TIME,
 THAT IS MORE THAN ANY OTHER
 SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT.
 MR. GOLDEN HAS BEEN HERE FOR
 FOUR YEARS, WHICH IS LONGER
 THAN MOST, BECAUSE IN DC, IT IS
 NOT JUST THE TEACHERS LEAVING,
 IT'S THE PRINCIPLES TO.
 SO WHEN I GOT HERE, IT WAS
 FUNNY, BECAUSE, IT WAS A
 BUILDING ENGINEER, SAID TO ME,
 YOU KNOW, NO PRINCIPAL REALLY
 LAST HERE.
 [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE SAID, THE
 KEY IS RELATIONSHIPS.
REPORTER: SOME OF THE
 STUDENTS HERE DEAL WITH MORE
 THAN MOST ADULTS CAN'T EVEN
 FATHOM.
 THE STUFF, WHERE BACK THERE
 IN MY DAY, CREEK WAS
 CLEAR.REPORTER: MYERS SEES IT
 EVERYDAY.

 SO MUCH.
 I WENT HERE FROM KINDERGARTEN
 TO SIXTH GRADE.
REPORTER: WITH ALL THE
 TURNOVER -- SHE IS THE ONE
 CONSTANT.
 34 YEARS UNDER HER BELT HERE AT

 HAVE TO WEAR SO MANY HATS, YOU
 KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE A NURSE,
 DOCTOR.

 HOW TO READ.
REPORTER: THIS IS AFTER HIS
 STUDENTS WERE ACCEPTED INTO THE
 COLLEGE READING GROUP.
 COLLEGE IS A GOAL, HE WANTS TO
 MAKE SURE THEY TAKE WITH THEM,
 EVEN AFTER HIS CLASS.
 THEY KNOW THAT IS ON THE

 GO TO COLLEGE, AND THEY WANT TO
 BE A PART OF THAT SELECT
 FEW.REPORTER: LATE LAST YEAR,

REPORTER: THOSE INSIDE THE
 SCHOOL THOUGH, SAY THERE ARE
 MANY DIFFERENT REASONS.
 YOU HAVE THOSE OUTSIDE
 PRESSURES, WEIGHING ON YOU, YOU
 HAVE A SCHOOL THAT IS
 CHALLENGING.
 SO, SOME PEOPLE QUESTION, IS
 EDUCATION, YOU KNOW, THE RIGHT
 CHOICE?
 DID I MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE?
 ALL RIGHT?
REPORTER: BUT, THE TEACHERS
 WHO STAY, THEIR REASON WHY IS
 SIMPLE.
 YOU KNOW, YOU CAN DODGE
 BULLETS ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL,
 BUT YOU CAN COME TO SCHOOL,
 KNOWING THAT YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM
 IS BEING ABUSED AT HOME, IF YOU
 CAN COME TO SCHOOL, KNOWING
 THAT YOU HAVE NOT SHOWERED IN A
 FEW DAYS, AND YOU HAVE NOT EVEN
 HAD A MEAL, AND COME HERE, AND

 INSPIRATION.I AM IN THE
 SCHOOL, WHERE I FEEL LIKE
 CHILDREN NEED TO BE LOVED.

 POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY, HERE, AND

 I WOULD FEEL LIKE A FAILURE, IF
 I JUST ABANDONED THEM.
 THOSE FACES, WHO CAN ABANDON
 THOSE FACES?

 WELL, AUTHORITIES HAVE SPENT YEARS WINNING US ABOUT
 SCAM ARTIST POSING AS IRS
 AGENTS, WILL NOW THEY ARE
 POSING TO BE OFFICERS FROM
 ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY,
 HEADS UP, FROM KENNETH CRAIG.
 I FELT LIKE MY IDENTITY HAD
 BEEN COMPROMISED, AND I WAS
 TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE
 GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
REPORTER: CARLA PIERCE
 RECEIVED A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE
 THIS PAST SUMMER.
 THIS IS OFFICER CHRIS
 MORRIS.
REPORTER: FROM SOMEONE
 CLEANING TO BE FROM THE SOCIAL
 SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, WHO
 SAID HER IDENTITY HAD BEEN
 STOLEN.
 BUT, IT WAS ALL A SCAM.
 SHE CALLED BACK, AND A FAKE
 OFFICER CONVINCED HER TO TURN
 OVER PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND
 SEND $50,000 FROM HER BANK,
 EXPLAINING IT WAS A TEMPORARY
 TRANSFER, NEEDED TO VERIFY HER
 IDENTITY.
 THE MONEY WOULD HAVE TO BE
 TRANSFERRED IN AND TRANSFERRED
 BACK.
REPORTER: LATER, CARLA
 REALIZED SHE WAS RIPPED OFF.
 WE WERE JUST STARTING TO
 SEE, THE SOCIAL SECURITY
 ADMINISTRATION BEING
 IMPERSONATED IN A BIG WAY.
REPORTER: AND KEVIN HUNT FROM
 THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU SAYS
 CON ARTISTS WILL USE VARIOUS
 METHODS TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.
 ONE ROBO CALL, THREATENS TO
 SUSPEND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY
 NUMBER.
 IF I DO NOT HEAR A CALL FROM
 YOU, WE WILL HAVE TO ISSUE AN
 ARREST WARRANT UNDER YOUR NAME.
REPORTER: NO MATTER THE
 TACTICS, SCAMMERS ULTIMATELY
 ARE LOOKING FOR MONEY AND
 PERSONAL INFORMATION.
 THE SOCIAL SECURITY
 ADMINISTRATION IS NEVER GOING
 TO CALL YOU, AND ASK YOU FOR
 YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER,
 THEY KNOW YOUR NUMBER.
REPORTER: WHAT DO PEOPLE NEED
 TO KNOW?THE NUMBER ONE THING
 IS, NEVER GIVE OUT INFORMATION
 TO PEOPLE, TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE
 CONTACTED THE TO YOU.
 I DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN
 ANY VIDEO.
REPORTER: WITH THE HELP OF
 FEDERAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITY,
 CARLA WAS ABLE TO GET HER MONEY
 BACK, WHICH IS EXTREMELY RARE.
 AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES,
 THE SCAM ARTISTS ARE NEVER
 FOUND.

        I would just like        to say thank you.

 WIDESPREAD REPORTING OF THE PAST FEW DAYS, WITH A SPECIAL
 COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.
 EXAMINING RUSSIAN INTERVENTION
 THE 2016 ELECTIONS, THE
 INVESTIGATION COULD BE NEARING
 ITS CONCLUSION.
 ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION
 HAVE PLAGUED THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION FROM THE START,
 LET'S BRING IN THE HOST OF
 CBS'S FACE THE NATION, MARGARET
 BRENNAN, HI MARGARET, SO, WE
 ARE HEARING IT IS A POSSIBILITY
 THAT THIS REPORT ARE PARTS OF
 IT, COULD BE SHIELDED FROM
 PUBLIC VIEW.
 SO, DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IS
 GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN BOB
 MUELLER AND HIS REPORT AND HIS
 REPORT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT
 OF JUSTICE?
 WELL, WE KNOW THAT IT WILL
 THEN BE THE CALL OF THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL, OF BILL BARR,
 AS TO WHETHER OR NOT, AT LEAST
 SOME OF OR PART OF IT, WILL BE
 PUBLIC, AND HOW MUCH TO SHARE
 WITH LAWMAKERS HIMSELF.
 ONCE YOU DO THAT, DOES THAT
 THEN MEAN THE INFORMATION
 LEAKS, AND GETS TERRY PICKED
 THOUGH, THEN DO YOU ARGUE THAT
 IT IS WITH A FULL DISCLOSURE TO
 THE PUBLIC, WHAT IS THE
 PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW, THESE
 ARE SOME OF THE BIG QUESTIONS,
 THAT ARE GOING TO NEXT BE ASKED
 AS WE LOOK AT WHAT COULD HAPPEN
 HERE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN ASKED
 WHAT HE THINKS SHOULD HAPPEN,
 HE SAYS IT IS ALL UP TO THE
 AGED, OF COURSE, IF IT IS NOT
 MADE PUBLIC, CONGRESS COULD TRY
 TO SUBPOENA IT, BUT THEN, YOU
 GET LOCKED IN THIS QUESTION OF
 WHO ENFORCES THAT SUBPOENA, CAN
 YOU FORCE A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 DO SOMETHING IT DOES NOT WANT
 TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 ALL OF THIS MEANS THOUGH, THAT
 EITHER, THERE IS THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THE AIR,
 AND LIVED THE CLOUDS THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAD SAID, HAVE BEEN
 OVER HIM SINCE HE BEGAN, BEGAN
 HIS TERM IN OFFICE. IF THERE IS
 TRULY NOTHING THERE, WHY NOT
 MAKE IT PUBLIC, BUT THEN
 THERE'S THE QUESTION AS WELL,
 OF WHAT THIS MEANS, IN TERMS OF
 SITTING PRESIDENT, AND WHAT
 THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF WHAT
 SHOULD BE SHARED INTO EVENT TO
 TRY AND PREVENT IT AGAIN FOR
 ANY TYPE OF INTERFERENCE, SO WE
 ARE ENTERING WHAT APPEARS TO BE
 THE NEXT STAGE OF THE POTENTIAL
 IMPACT OF THE MILLER PROBE, BUT
 REALLY, NO HARD TIMELINE ON
 WHEN THIS COULD COME OUT, IT IS
 EXPECTED SOMETIME IN THE NEXT
 FEW WEEKS.
 MARGARET, QUICKLY OF COURSE
 THE OPTICS OF TRYING TO KEEP
 ANY PART OF IT FROM PUBLIC VIEW
 WOULD BE HEAVILY SCRUTINIZED.
 IT WILL BE HEAVILY
 SCRUTINIZED, AND IT WILL BE
 MAILED ABLATED BY BOTH SIDES,
 THAT IS WHY THE SENATOR,
 REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY
 SAID IT IS GOING TO LEAK
 ANYWAY, WHY NOT MAKE PARTS OF
 IT PUBLIC.
 WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE THE FULL
 THING, AS THERE ARE THINGS THAT
 ARE GOING TO BE KEPT PRIVATE BY
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
 BUT OF COURSE, WHAT PEOPLE WANT
 TO FOCUS ON, IS WHAT ARE THE
 CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THOSE
 INDICTMENTS, THOSE GUILTY PLEAS
 WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN FOR MANY
 OF THE PLAYERS, YOU KNOW, THERE
 HAVE BEEN ABOUT 34 OR FIVE
 CASES THAT HAVE MOVED FORWARD,
 INCLUDING THOSE 25 RUSSIAN
 MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS
 . IS THERE ANY CONNECTION
 BETWEEN THEM AND THE PRESIDENT
 HIMSELF, AND THE CAMPAIGN.
 THOSE THE PARTS THAT ARE
 PERHAPS, MOST RELEVANT TO THE
 BIG POLITICAL QUESTION, THAT WE
 ARE ALL FACING.
 A BIG DISCUSSION THAT WILL
 CONTINUE TO: THREE SUNDAY
 MORNING, FACE THE NATION AND
 WUSA 9, MARGARET BRENNER, AS
 ALWAYS, THANK YOU.
 SO, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
 THE FACT THAT THE SNOW IS GONE,
 THE TEMPERATURES ARE GOING UP,
 BUT NOW, IT IS THE WIND THAT WE
 HAD TO CONTEND WITH.
 WE HAVE A LOT TO DEAL WITH
 THIS WE CAN.
 IT IS NOT GOING TO BE SNOWING,
 BUT FIRST WHEN, WELL SECOND
 WIND, BUT FOR SPRING, GOING TO
 START WITH THE WIND, BECAUSE
 ONCE YOU GET THE SOGGY GROUND,
 HE STARTS RING WINS THAT COULD
 BE GUSTING 40, 50, OR MORE,
 THEN, WE HAVE GOT SOME
 PROBLEMS, POTENTIALLY WITH
 INCREASED TREES COMING DOWN,
 DECREASED APPETITE OF THESE
 AFFECT HERE ARE SOME OF THE
 MOMENT, FROM FREDERICK WEST,
 HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE BLUE
 RIDGE, DISCUSSED 50 TO 60, I
 WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED THOUGH
 IS THIS IT'S EXPANDED MORE
 TOWARDS THE METRO, AND IF YOU
 WONDERED ABOUT THIS, THIS IS
 GOING TO BE A BIG STORM,
 BLIZZARD WARNINGS ARE OUT
 ACROSS THE PLAINS, IT COULD BE
 GUST OF 70s IN WESTERN NEW
 YORK.
 BUT, BEFORE THAT GETS HERE, WE
 HAVE GOT RAIN THAT WE ARE
 TRACKING TONIGHT.
 SOUTH OF TOWN.
 GOING DOWN TO RICHMOND, YOU'RE
 GOING TO RUN INTO THIS, MAYBE
 HARRISONBURG SOUTH IN THE
 VALLEY, BUT AROUND HERE, THIS
 WILL STAY SOUTH, WITH HEAVIER
 SHOWERS, MOVING INTO RICHMOND,
 DO EAST FOR THE MOST PART, SO,
 IT IS GOING TO GET ON SOME OF
 THAT, BUT REALLY THIS IS WAY
 WAY SOUTH OF US, SO A QUIET
 NIGHT HERE, WE HAVE GOT CLOUDY
 SKIES, TEMPERATURES IN THE
 UPPER 40s, WITH A NORTHWEST
 WIND, SO A LITTLE BIT OF WIND
 CHILL, BUT THE AIR IS DRY,
 HUMIDITY IS ONLY 46%, SO THAT
 TELLS YOU THE CHANCE FOR RAIN
 TONIGHT IS ABOUT THAT.
 48 IN TOWN, BUT 40 NOW IN
 WINCHESTER, 34 IN OAKLAND,
 STILL 46 WITH AN ENABLER
 STATION IN SOUTHERN MARYLAND,
 AND TOMORROW, WILL FEATURE
 CLOUDS IN THE MORNING, MAYBE A
 PEAK OF SUN EARLY, LOW 40s,
 THAT IS IT, WITH SHOWERS
 DEVELOPING IN THE AFTERNOON,
 AND THAT COULD BE READY STEADY
 RAIN ACTUALLY, PRETTY MODERATE
 RAIN AT TIMES, AS FAR AS THE
 WEEKEND, LOW 40s TOMORROW, BUT
 THEN SUNDAY, AN EARLY SHOWER,
 WINDY AND WARMER, IN THE 60s,
 MAYBE EVEN UPPER 60s WITH
 ENOUGH SUNSHINE.
 , THOSE GUSTS ARE GOING TO BE A
 PROBLEM, SO WE ARE GOING TO
 KEEP THE YELLOW WEATHER ALERT
 UP FOR SUNDAY, AND THIS SHOWS
 YOU, THE WINTER STORM WARNINGS
 IN ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO,
 BLIZZARD WARNINGS FOR EASTERN
 COLORADO, TO MINNESOTA.
 THAT IS HOW BIG A STORM SYSTEM
 THIS IS, AND THIS IS THE ONE
 DUMPING ALL THE SNOW ON THE
 SOUTHWEST, OVER 40 INCHES, I
 CANNOT IMAGINE THAT, IN
 FLAGSTAFF, SINCE WEDNESDAY.
 AND, ALL THE RAIN THAT WILL BE
 MOVING IN HERE, STARTING
 MIDDAY, IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON
 TOMORROW, AS IT MOVES IN FROM
 THE SOUTHWEST, BUT NO PROBLEMS
 TONIGHT, HERE JUST COMES THAT
 RAIN, ONCE WE GET INTO TOMORROW
 AFTERNOON, AT TIMES IT WILL BE
 LOCALLY HEADY -- HEAVY HEADING
 OUR WAY.
 TO MECHANICAL, LOW TO MID 30s,
 QUIET NIGHT.
 WENT NORTHEAST AT FIVE, CLOUDY
 AND COLD TONIGHT, WITH SHOWERS
 APPROACHING WITH THE SOUTHWEST,
 LATE MORNING, 32 TO 40, AND
 THEN, REMOVES AND LOCALLY,
 HEAVY.
 UPPER 30s TO LOW 40s, THAT IS
 IT.
 HE COULD SEE AN INCH, MAY BE
 MORE OF RAIN IN SPOTS, AS WE
 GET INTO SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
 YELLOW WEATHER ALERT SUNDAY FOR
 THE MORNING SHOWERS, THE WINDS,
 TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s, BUT
 BACK IN THE 40s MONDAY, WITH
 WIND, THE WIND CHILLS 20s AND
 30s, A COLD, BUT GENERALLY DRY
 WEEK UNTIL FRIDAY, WHEN WE HAVE
 A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS.AND

 BROUGHT TO YOU BY X AFFINITY.
 I'M DARREN HAYNES AT
 NATIONAL SPRING TRAINING.
 NOW, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL IS
 NOT ALWAYS ABOUT THE HITTING,
 PITCHING, STEVE PLAYS A HUGE
 FACTOR IN SCORING RUNS.
 AND, MY MAN TREY TURNER IS AN
 EXAMPLE OF THAT.
 TREY TURNER IS ONE OF THE
 FASTEST PLAYERS CURRENTLY IN
 MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.
 ACCORDING TO MLB ADVANCED
 MEDIA, TREY TURNER'S 30.1 FEET
 PER SECOND, RANKS FIFTH IN THE
 MAJORS LAST SEASON.
 TURNER WAS CLOCKED AT 22.7
 MILES PER HOUR, WHILE LEGGING
 OUT A TRIPLE.
 IMPRESSIVE.
 THE FASTEST BALLCARRIER IN THE
 NFL LAST SEASON, WITH ONLY

 HE ALSO RAN FROM HOME THE FIRST
 BASE IN 3.7 SECONDS.
 THAT IS ONLY SIX TENTHS OF A
 SECOND SLOWER THAN HALL OF
 FAMER MICKEY MANTLE'S ALL-TIME
 RECORD OF THREE POINT ONE.
 WITH THAT SPEED, TURNER COULD
 ALMOST FEEL BASES AT WILL.
 MAKE THEM RUN.
 FASTER THAN SOME, NOT ALL, BUT,
 YOU KNOW, SOMETHING I HAVE HAD,
 SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID, AND
 SINCE WE WERE STILL LOOK AT, SO
 I TRY TO USE IT AS MUCH AS I
 CAN.
 REMAKE HE STOLE 42 BASES LAST
 SEASON.
 THAT RINGS SECOND IN THE
 MAJORS, AND SET A NEW FRANCHISE
 RECORD.
 IT IS EXCITING, YOU KNOW.
 AND, WE LET THE RAINS GO, AND HE
 IS ON HIS OWN, HE CAN STILL
 ENABLE WANTS, HE KNOWS THAT.
 WE CAN PUT THE PRESSURE ON HIM
 A LITTLE BIT, ABOUT MAY BECOME
 HAVING MORE TIMES.
REPORTER: TURNER WILL ENTER
 HIS FIFTH SEASON, AND HE IS
 ALREADY OFF TO A QUICK START.
 IS REALLY.NAME WHEN HE PLAY
 ON A TEAM YOU WANT TO GIVE THE
 USER TO
 TREY TURNER.
 WHILE.
 IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS FAST AND
 HE LIKES TO DO EVERY THING FAST.
 NOW, I ASKED TREY TURNER
 NAME THE SPORT YOU WISH YOU
 COULD PLAY TO UTILIZE YOUR
 SPEED, HE SAID TRACK, AND MAKE
 SENSE, RIGHT?
 BUT THEN, HE TOLD ME, HE IS NOT
 DOWN TO PRACTICE WITH THE
 KNEES.
 I AM FOR SPORTS, WUSA 9 SPORT.
