I'm Craig Melvin. And I'm Natalie Morales. nd this is Dateline. R: I just dropped off the children and he wouldn't let me in the door. MAN: It was horrible. We're normal people, and the person you're dealing with is a psychopath. NATALIE MORALES: It's the story that haunted the country, the case of Susan Powell. WOMAN: I was like, this can't be real. And he professed to love them. NATALIE MORALES: Could it have been prevented? SOCIAL WORKER: He exploded the house. As you listen to it now, what does it do to you? It's excruciating. NATALIE MORALES: The 911 dispatcher shares his story about that day. I wish I had recognized the urgency of the situation. NATALIE MORALES: Also, the startling details of a plot unfolding. Nobody knew what was going on. NATALIE MORALES: And a father's unraveling. He just saw there was no way out. NATALIE MORALES: Intimate emails from Susan herself. The young mother's private fears in her own words. It's the genuine belief of a good many people that you killed her. NATALIE MORALES: Her husband speaks a final eerie interview. I love my sons more than anything. I put them first. I put my family first. [theme music] Hello, and welcome to Dateline. The details are heartbreaking. The disappearance of a young mom and what befell her two little boys. You'll hear from her loved ones searching for answers and justice. You'll also hear from her husband, Josh Powell, in his last in-depth interview. Words that are even more haunting now. Here is Keith Morrison with A Family's Story. KEITH MORRISON: It is so sad to look at them now, this apparently perfectly normal family. Just a young father and his two young sons walking a postcard shore, skipping rocks across the surface. But under the surface of the man's own skin-
- Well, what was beneath the surface? How in the name of heaven did this come to this? 911 OPERATOR: Hi, ma'am. Were you calling about the fire on the 8200 block, ma'am? FEMALE CALLER: Yeah. He exploded the house. 911 OPERATOR: OK. Do you know if anyone's in the house? FEMALE CALLER: Yes. There was a man and two children. I just dropped off the children and he wouldn't let me in the door. KEITH MORRISON: You'll hear an exclusive interview with the man who took that call and who has been criticized for not getting help, immediately. And you find yourself vilified really. What was that like? Well, it's awful. Part of the problem is that, like most people I think, I was aware of Josh Powell's story, but I didn't associate his name with the story. KEITH MORRISON: We will retrace Josh Powell's last steps. Mysterious trips to a gas station. A storage locker where the police said they found a quilt with blood on it. And the bank were, in the surveillance photo, he has the look of a man unglued. And nobody knew what was going on. He took more than three or four substantial steps to get ready for his death. KEITH MORRISON: We'll hear investigators try to fathom the unfathomable. What's the motive for him killing his kids? Is it that they started knowing a little too much? KEITH MORRISON: And in his last interview, we'll hear from Josh Powell himself who offered, like the negative of a film, a bizarre reversal of the truth. I love my sons more than anything. I put them first. I put my family first. KEITH MORRISON: On February 5th, 2012, while the rest of the country was settling down to watch the Super Bowl, Josh Powell was setting a trap for his own young sons. What happened in there was really only the last chapter of a very long, sad story of fathers and sons and husbands and wives, sexual delusions, murder, suicide, and secrets. Some of those secrets, no doubt, were burned up in the fire. But some things we do know, and they go to the darkest recesses of the human heart. Our story begins years ago when a cheerful young woman named Susan Cox fell for Josh. Chuck and Judy Cox are Susan's parents. As they spoke to us, they confessed they were still in a kind of shock after the disaster that claimed their two young grandsons. And they recalled so clearly their early fears about their daughter's beau. I had a very bad feeling every time I saw him. I even asked my daughter, Why are you marrying him? KEITH MORRISON: Josh's sister, Jennifer Graves, told us that as a child, she was wary of him too. When Josh was a boy, he was troubled in some ways, wasn't he? There were some issues, yeah. KEITH MORRISON: Jennifer says much of the problems stemmed from her father, Josh's father. She is estranged from him today. Their mother divorced him years ago and in court papers alleged he was abusive. I was about 14 when I woke up and realized, my dad is a wacko. He's just on a different trajectory, and not a good one. KEITH MORRISON: She is talking about Steven Powell. You're going to learn much more about him, later. What was it about his trajectory that bothered you or disturbed you? He just had a really negative outlook on life. He was down on just everything. KEITH MORRISON: An outlook he seemed to have passed on to Josh which, paradoxically, seemed to attract Susan. I think she felt sorry for him. He didn't have many friends. And I think she felt she could make him happy and that he would change. KEITH MORRISON: They married in the Mormon church and certainly looked happy in those early photos. But later, the couple moved to Utah. Moved in temporarily with Jennifer and her husband Kirk. What was the relationship like then, as far as you could tell? It was a little rough. She would kind of order him around a little bit and he wanted to control her and not let her go to some activities with me. KEITH MORRISON: Josh worked, sometimes, in real estate and as a web designer. When Susan went into labor with their first child, says Susan's parents, Josh, working right there at home, said he was too busy to drive her to the hospital. They did. And when he finally arrived-
- He sits in the back of the room working on his computer. While she's in labor. Yeah. It was a really odd experience. KEITH MORRISON: They named the baby Charlie. Braden followed two years later. But having kids only seemed to increase the friction between Susan and Josh. She would be wanting to put them to bed. She would even go so far as to get them in bed, and then he would get mad and tell them to get out of bed and not do what mom told them to do. Where did Josh get these parenting ideas? I'm sure from my dad. KEITH MORRISON: More and more influence from dad, said Jennifer. Josh started talking on the phone with my dad a lot. He would spend multiple hours, multiple times a week on the phone with him. And Susan would complain to me about how Josh would just become unbearable to live with. It was really obvious to her that my dad was trying to drive a wedge between them. KEITH MORRISON: It seemed to be working. Jennifer shared something with us she has never made public before. Excerpts of emails from Susan. Did they contain hints of what was coming? In one of them, she describes her attempts to rekindle romance with Josh. I've tried the dates thing with him and it goes to negative or no conversation, or it's an obligation to him that he seems to hate. I think it's easy to say that Josh learned from his dad how to treat women. KEITH MORRISON: And then there's another email that suggests Susan was actually afraid of him. Every moment I step back and take stock of what I'm dealing with. It feels like a never-ending cycle, but I'm too afraid of the consequences-
- losing my kids, him kidnapping, divorce, or actions worse on his part. Why wouldn't he just get a divorce? Because she had an income. She was the mom. There was a very strong argument that the boys would have gone with her. SOCIAL WORKER: And so they believe Josh found another solution to his problem. NATALIE MORALES: Coming up. I sat on this feeling, this gut-sinking, terrible feeling that he has done something to her.

Josh and Susan were both expected at work. And neither one of them had shown up, and neither one of them had called. And they were supposed to have dropped off their kids. KEITH MORRISON: Dropped them off at daycare, she means. So the daycare center people called their emergency contact, Jennifer. She went to Josh and Susan's house. It was empty. The feeling hit me really strongly that Josh had done something to her. KEITH MORRISON: Hindsight, perhaps? Or the insight of someone who had grown up with Josh Powell. I said, You know, hon, don't worry about this. This is just a couple and their kids. They're off. They're adults. They'll be fine. KEITH MORRISON: Then, the late afternoon, Josh suddenly showed up with the boys, without Susan. And I remember the feeling I had at that time. Which was what? Which was, Josh has done something. KEITH MORRISON: Josh told a story no one could believe. That the previous night, Sunday, he decided to take the boys camping. Left around midnight, he said. Blew off work. Drove almost 100 miles. Slept in the family van in temperatures well below freezing. Then drove back home to find Susan, gone. He said he had no idea what happened to her. When he came up with that story about going camping, I was just-
- no. I got a really sick feeling that no, this is not good. CROWD: (SINGING) Silent Night. KEITH MORRISON: And yet, they did what they felt they should do. They rallied around Josh. They pleaded for Susan's safe return. We want to find her, return her to her husband and children. KEITH MORRISON: Within 10 days, police declared Josh a person of interest in Susan's disappearance. He stopped talking to police and then left town. Packed up his possessions and his precious sons. Left Utah to go live in Washington with his father, Steven. When we spoke to him in 2011, he told us he interrogated his son. Josh, you know, the most abusive thing that a father could ever do is murder his wife. You know, things like that. I wanted to-
- 
- You were testing him. 
- I was testing him. I wanted to see his reaction to this kind of stuff. And? It was good. I was totally satisfied with it. I mean, to me, he passed with flying colors. KEITH MORRISON: As for Susan, he said, she had just run off with another man, most likely. Susan was veropen and I would say very aggressive in male-female relationships. And she called the shots. KEITH MORRISON: How did he know that? Steven claimed Susan had developed a long-standing crush on him. Susan would come in to my office afteshe waxed her legs, and she would sit there and she would say, Feel my legs. They're pretty smooth. And so, yeah, I know. Josh wasn't concerned about this? You know, I didn't talk to Josh about it. I mean, you know, I just enjoyed the moment. KEITH MORRISON: Steven enjoyed quite a few moments with Susan, he said. Like when he'd hand her the baby. She'd come up and press herself against my hands, and then I'd have to pull my hands out from between her and Braden, just slip away, you know. That kind of a thing. KEITH MORRISON: He said his only regret was not going a little further with her. I mean, it's not like I didn't enjoy that kind of a little thing. KEITH MORRISON: It was so easy for him to tell stories. Susan could not defend herself. What he says is not based on reality. KEITH MORRISON: Josh's sister, Jennifer Graves, was a confidante of Susan. And, of course, as his daughter, she already knew all about Steven. He might have felt these things for her. He might have been sexually attracted to her. But she did not reciprocate. KEITH MORRISON: For a very few uncomfortable months, she said, early in their marriage, Susan and Josh lived with Steven. They were set up in the dining room, so they had put up sheets for the privacy. And she had caught my dad spying on her. Did she say how it made her feel? Oh, she definitely was creeped out by it. He definitely made her uncomfortable. There was one incident where they were in a car. He said, Would you be willing to share? Josh and I can just share you. KEITH MORRISON: And now, Susan was missing. Josh was still a person of interest. Steven was telling lewd stories. And these men had Susan's children, the Cox's grandchildren. They were being raised by the same person who had raised Josh, and my daughter was just a hundred percent against them ever having anything to do with Steve. And here they were in his house. And here they were in his house because Josh went there, you know, brings them there. KEITH MORRISON: But Josh's actions brought other people to his father's house, namely the police. In August, 2011, they arrived with a search warrant. We've got probable cause to believe that there are some items of evidentiary value inside the home of the Powells. KEITH MORRISON: They found plenty. Evidence that might eventually help turn the mystery into an incomprehensible tragedy. But back then, there was no way to know that. Even as we sat down for an extraordinary conversation with the person of interest, Josh Powell, himself, no way to know then that this conversation would be the last one. NATALIE MORALES: Coming up. They're just trying to rattle your cage. It would seem. Are you rattled? I'm pretty pissed off. NATALIE MORALES: Josh Powell in his final television interview. Were there hints of what was to come? When Dateline continues. KEITH MORRISON: It was August, 2011. Still warm. The night Josh Powell came to see us to break his long silence. They know everything. KEITH MORRISON: An extraordinary conversation at the time, even more so in hindsight. As we spoke, the police were searching for evidence at his father's house in Puyallup, Washington. Josh seemed quite confident they wouldn't find anything. Well, according to my attorney, the less they have on a person, the more they basically harass a person. So what you're suggesting is that they're just trying to rattle your cage. It would seem. Are you rattled? I'm pretty pissed off. KEITH MORRISON: Josh claimed he knew things about Susan's childhood that her parents were hiding. Susan's adult behavior, or at least Steven's lewd suggestions of her behavior, claimed Josh, were the result of childhood abuse. An allegation the Coxes dismiss as patently ridiculous. I've known about things that she's told me about while she was growing up. And you think that's the reason why, according to your father at least, she would come onto him. I don't think people are characterizing that right. She's a flirtatious person. I hate to tell you Josh that others who have seen that interview with your father have sort of gone, Ew, that's totally inappropriate. A, to behave that way. And then, B, to even talk about it. Do you ever get that sense from hearing him describe these things? Well, I haven't had any real deep conversations with him about any of that stuff. He hasn't told you those things, those stories? I mean, I was there to see that Susan was always proud of her legs being cleanly waxed and how smooth they were. She would ask people to feel them. I told her I thought it was pretty inappropriate. KEITH MORRISON: Josh was siding with his father against just about everyone else. A fateful choice it turned out. And what you're telling me is that, that story, or those stories rather, as told by your dad, are accurate. And the stories told by Jennifer Graves and Susan's friends, that Susan was horrified by this and wanted to get the heck away from it as much as she could, that those stories are lies. That's right. So, on that night in December, 2009, when you went out to the desert with the kids to go camping, what happened to Susan? I think that Susan simply left. Simply left. I mean, just at midnight, 1 o'clock in the morning just, I've had enough. I'm out of here. Was she angry those days? Nope. Was she distressed? Nope. Did she continue to assert that she loved you? Yeah. And, God knows, she must have loved your children. Yeah. And yet, she, at midnight or 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning that night in December, got up out of her bed and went downstairs and got on a bicycle or something, or walked, and simply left. And has never, you know, hasn't even sent you a note to suggest she's still alive. Is that what's happened? I don't know what's happened to her. I don't know where she is. It's the genuine belief, obviously, of a good many people who have been following this strange saga, that you killed her. That's the allegation that a lot of people believe. What can you say to them to make them change their minds? I've never hurt my wife. I've never, never hurt her. KEITH MORRISON: And still he claimed Susan's parents were out to get him, to take his children away. They started to try to say that my sons are in an emotionally-
- some kind of emotional danger from being in my custody. And that's a completely unfair statement. KEITH MORRISON: And that's why he did what he did, he said, when he and the boys encountered Chuck Cox at a hardware store a few months after Susan disappeared. He said that he wanted to hug my children. I said, No, you may not. Those are his grandchildren, just as they're your children. I mean, shouldn't a grandfather be able to hug his grandchildren? He should not be using them as pawns in the media. I love my sons more than anything. I put them first. I put my family first. KEITH MORRISON: Words that now ring horribly false, of course, as do these about his missing wife and their two young sons. What do you tell them about her? I just tell them that we don't know where she's at. Do they understand? How much of it do they understand? I think they understand quite a bit. KEITH MORRISON: Indeed it now seems they did. And that too would play a role in what was coming. Do you worry that somebody will charge you with a crime that will prevent you from being with them? Nope. You don't think that's going to happen? Nope. What makes you so sure? Because I never did anything that someone would be able to charge me with. I never hurt Susan. And I had nothing to do with her disappearance. KEITH MORRISON: Did he know how few believed him? In the end it hardly mattered because when police entered the secret places in his father's house, they found evidence of crimes, all right. Not the crimes they were looking for, but enough to push Josh Powell to the brink. NATALIE MORALES: Coming up. There are some videos and pictures of Susan. Somebody was hiding and shooting through curtains and doors. NATALIE MORALES: Family secrets emerge when Dateline continues. That rocking chair would look great in our new house. Ahh, New house, eh?

KEITH MORRISON: When we met Josh Powell in Puyallup, Washington, he and his dad Steven invited us to join them and Charlie and Braden on a family outing. It was summer, 2011. JOSH POWELL: All right, come on. KEITH MORRISON: And a casual observer might never have guessed the circumstances that brought these two strange men and two little boys together. The kids appeared normal, happy. But of course, by then, for more than a year and a half they'd been missing someone very dear to them-
- their mother, Susan Powell. And Susan's parents were sure Josh knew exactly what happened to her. When did you first think that Josh killed Susan? Probably when he came up with this I went camping routine. KEITH MORRISON: But there was not yet enough evidence to charge him. And then, as Josh and I talked that evening at the end of August, the police raided his father's house looking for more. And they did find evidence, but not at all what they expected. Well, we discovered a lot of computers and a lot of material. KEITH MORRISON: Ed Troyer of the Pierce County Sheriff's Department describing what was seized from Steven Powell's home. There was some child pornography in there, and there were some voyeuristic pictures and videos. KEITH MORRISON: And not just filth dug up from the internet, but rather material someone had filmed himself, in secret. That someone, said Troyer, was Steven Powell. Pictures and videos that were taken from his house into the neighbor's house of little girls using bathroom, showers, shot right from his own window. KEITH MORRISON: Steven was arrested, hauled off to jail, and charged with 14 counts of voyeurism and one count of possessing child pornography, a felony. I've been asked to plead not guilty related to all charges. KEITH MORRISON: This was the same Steven Powell, remember, who claimed his daughter-in-law Susan had a serious crush on him before she disappeared. When he said it, it sounded like an old fool's fantasy. Now it turned out there was evidence the fantasy had a very dark undercurrent. Because there was another face, a familiar one, in Steven Powell's homemade porn stash. Tell me about the discovery of the videos involving Susan Powell. There are some videos and pictures of Susan that were obviously taken without her consent or her knowledge. Somebody was hiding and taking them, shooting through curtains and doors and taking pictures of her. KEITH MORRISON: It had to have happened early in the marriage when Susan and Josh, strapped for cash, moved in with Steven for a while. And, you know, even though he said that she was interested in him, we believe that's all one big fantasy, and she absolutely despised him. KEITH MORRISON: The charges brought against Steven Powell in 2011 were ugly enough. But before long, they set in motion something much bigger-
- a full-on battle for control of Charlie and Braden. We were able to take the kids out of the residence until an investigation was done, and the kids were placed with Susan's parents. KEITH MORRISON: Susan's parents, Chuck and Judy Cox, in Josh and Steven's world-
- the enemy. I had Braden in the back, it was before preschool, and we're driving and he says, Grandpa, you need to change your name. Well, why? My name's Charles Cox. He says, Yeah. Charles Cox is a bad person, and so you need to change your name. Who says Charles Cox is a bad person? Oh, my daddy. KEITH MORRISON: Josh had done everything he could to keep Chuck and Judy away from his sons. Now they had the upper hand. My clients believe it is very harmful for these children to have been in the home of Steven Powell who was deeply involved with pornography. KEITH MORRISON: At this hearing that September, Josh Powell represented himself in family court. Denied any knowledge of his father's alleged crimes. Promised to keep the boys away from Steven, should the elder Powell somehow make bail. But here you could almost see Josh unraveling. I am a fit and qualified father. I am the natural father. I love my sons. And the manner in which they-
- [exhales loudly] The manner in which they were behaving leads me to believe that the irreparable harm that is occurring to my sons is having taken them out of the stable and happy home. KEITH MORRISON: But then a prosecutor told the judge that so far, only a small portion of the evidence had been examined. And while Josh Powell hadn't been charged yet, he still might be. Mr. Powell is a subject of that investigation, and that's the concern that the department has. KEITH MORRISON: So Josh lost that round and lost the ones that followed, including the very last one. The final defeat came when the judge ordered that the boys could stay with the Coxes for at least six more months. So you got that favorable ruling. Favorable ruling. A very good day. Except Josh is still not arrested. Our daughter's still missing. KEITH MORRISON: But those facts might have changed too with a second ruling from the judge that day. She ordered Josh Powell to undergo a psychosexual evaluation. Why? Because, according to Utah investigators, some images had been found on a computer in his home back in 2009, the year Susan disappeared. It was cartoons. The cartoons and the animation are of adults and kids having sex. KEITH MORRISON: And Josh's evaluation was to include a polygraph test, a lie detector. He had lost the custody of the kids, he had to undergo a lie detector. And what's he going to tell them? And if they ask about Susan, with a lie detector on-
- Which they would have. Which they would have, he's not going to be able to lie. I just saw that as, this is going to be-
- he has no way he's going to get through this. The trap was really closing in around him. Yeah. He's feeling really closed in. KEITH MORRISON: And, if that wasn't pressure enough, there was this too. Rumors that Charlie and Braden were getting pretty comfortable with their grandparents. That they'd started talking about that midnight camping trip. NATALIE MORALES: Just how much did the boys know about their mother's disappearance? A secret is soon revealed. Coming up. He was explained, Well, mother's in the trunk. NATALIE MORALES: And new information emerges about Josh's past. There was a warning sign, way early. NATALIE MORALES: When Dateline continues.

Josh Powell was under suspicion. And as autumn deepened into winter, Chuck and Judy Cox heard again and again, The arrest of Josh Powell was next. It could happen any day. So they waited, held their breath, and took in the boys, Charlie and Braden. How was it, living with those boys for the months you had them? How about exhausting. Yeah. We went to bed exhausted every night. But it felt good to have the kids there. KEITH MORRISON: The Coxes were much stricter disciplinarians than Josh. They enforced early bedtimes and regular meals. And, according to Josh's sister and brother-in-law, the kids thrived. Right after the custody hearing, where they were finally in the Cox's home, we saw them that day and they were withdrawn and angry and quiet. And then two months later, they were sitting on laps and hugging and playing and listening while people read stories to them. And they were acting more like little boys. We're also very concerned for the welfare of our grandchildren. KEITH MORRISON: Chuck and Judy were determined to keep them. And as they battled Josh in family court, they began to turn up new and disturbing information about the man who married their daughter. They found it in the divorce papers of his father, Steven. Right after Steve was arrested, we went over to Spokane and pulled up the record. KEITH MORRISON: There were disturbing allegations in there that Josh had attempted suicide by hanging as a teenager. That he had threatened his mother with a knife. And there was this story about Josh and Steven. There was an incident where Josh killed his younger sister Alina's hamster by smashing it against the side of the cage. And Josh's mother was outraged. And Steve's response, according to the papers there was, She just does not understand teenage humor. Teenage humor. Teenage humor. And I'm going, huh? What on earth are you talking about? And one of the first things I've heard for killers is that they abuse animals or kill animals. And there was a warning signs, way early. KEITH MORRISON: Of course, they believed he was a killer, had killed their daughter, even though he hadn't been charged. And then they say the kids began to open up. One of them told me one time, I think it was Charlie, that he hoped Mommy knew how to camp or something because she was out where she needed to know how to camp. KEITH MORRISON: And they heard about an earlier episode, where one of the boys drew a picture at his preschool. He drew a car, two boys, and a dad. No mom. The teacher asked where she was. Well, mother's in the trunk, you know. And they knew who he was. KEITH MORRISON: All the while, even though the boys now lived with the Coxes, they made court-ordered visits to Josh at the house he was renting. A house, police now say, he didn't really live in. We believe that the house was staged just for the purpose of the visitation and to make himself look like a good dad with the photos on the wall, the kid's stuff, the minivan in the driveway and the garage. And, unfortunately, it was everything but that. KEITH MORRISON: Where did Josh actually live? Steven's house. And now that Josh seemed in danger of losing custody of the kids permanently, Chuck says he worried not about the boys so much but about the social worker who took them to see Josh. I was concerned that if she confronted Josh in any way, that he might hurt her. KEITH MORRISON: Which brings us inexorably to that Sunday, the first time the kids would visit Josh after he was ordered to take the polygraph. I got a bad feeling about this. And I didn't really get a bad feeling till like Saturday. I was thinking, you know, maybe I should ask somebody to have a little more security this time, or maybe we should skip this visit. KEITH MORRISON: The kids were having fun playing. Didn't want to go. But, of course, there wasn't a choice. They had to go. I thought, I have to get them to go or I'm breaking a law, and we'll get in trouble for it. KEITH MORRISON: And so she jollied them into it. I said, You'll do something fun. You know, Daddy will have a project. You'll get to eat with Daddy. You'll have fun. KEITH MORRISON: No idea, of course, about the careful plans Josh had been making for that visit. NATALIE MORALES: Coming up. When you listen to that tape, it's almost painful. It's excruciating. NATALIE MORALES: For the first time, the 911 dispatcher shares his story about that day. I wish I had recognized the urgency of the situation. NATALIE MORALES: When Dateline continues. I thought I was managing my moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. But I realized something was missing... me. The thought of my symptoms returning was keeping me from being there for the people and things I love most.

Welcome back to Dateline. I'm Natalie Morales. Time was running out for Josh Powell. Little Charlie and Braden were starting to open up about the night their mother disappeared. And meanwhile, a judge ordered Josh to take a polygraph. But first, he planned to see his boys, and who could have predicted what a dark turn those plans would take. Now, to Keith Morrison, with the conclusion of A Family's Story. KEITH MORRISON: He was a person of interest in Susan Powell's disappearance. The target of a relentless police investigation. His contacts with his two sons had been reduced by court order to a few hours twice a week. Rumors of an imminent arrest swirled around him. And Josh Powell was preparing to strike back. Hear what police have pieced together of his final days. On February 4th, 2012, Josh deposited his children's toys and clothing in a charity drop box near his house. At 11:32 AM he walked into a bank where he withdrew $7,000 in cash and transferred thousands more, police believe, to his sister who was still close to him. At 1:30 PM he arrived at this storage unit. Here, police say, he spent an hour and a half going through Susan's belongings. Then, back at his minivan, he drove 10 miles out of town to this landfill where he dumped the bundle of material from the storage unit. That evening he walked into this department store, purchased two five-gallon gas cans and a pack of Sterno-
- the stuff you use to keep food hot. Then he went to a gas station to fill those cans. The next morning, Sunday, Josh composed emails to family members. Most just said, I'm sorry. Goodbye. At 10:30 he called his sister Alina's cell phone. JOSH POWELL (ON RECORDING): Hello. This is Josh. And I'm-
- I'm calling to say goodbye. I am not able to live without my sons. And I'm not able to go on anymore. I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt. Goodbye. KEITH MORRISON: His alarmed sister called 911. ALINA POWELL: I think my brother might be in trouble or something. 911 OPERATOR: What's going on with your brother? ALINA POWELL: He is-
- I don't know. He's sending weird emails. He's saying goodbye and stuff. KEITH MORRISON: And then, Josh doused the house with gasoline. Prepared the axe he would use on the boys before he lit the match. Around noon, the social worker brought Charlie and Braden for their court-ordered visitation. Josh grabbed the boys, pulled them inside, locked her out. At 12:08 she made her first call to 911. SOCIAL WORKER: Hey. I'm on a supervised visitation for a court-ordered visit, and something really weird has happened. The kids went into the house and the parent-
- the biological parent, whose name is Josh Powell-
- will not let me in the door. What should I do? KEITH MORRISON: And the operator kept her on the line answering questions for nearly seven minutes. 911 OPERATOR: Date of birth? SOCIAL WORKER: I don't know. He's about 39. 911 OPERATOR: How tall? SOCIAL WORKER: Um, 5' 10, 150 pounds. 911 OPERATOR: Hair color? SOCIAL WORKER: Brown. 911 OPERATOR: Did you notice what he was wearing? SOCIAL WORKER: No, I didn't notice what he was wearing. KEITH MORRISON: And finally. 911 OPERATOR: All right. We'll have somebody look for you there. SOCIAL WORKER: OK. How long will it be? 911 OPERATOR: I don't know, ma'am. They have to respond to emergency life-threatening situations first. The first available deputy-
- SOCIAL WORKER: Well, this could-
- this could be life-threatening. He went to court on Wednesday and he-
- he didn't get his kids back. And this is really-
- I'm-
- I'm afraid for their lives. KEITH MORRISON: Deputies were alerted by dispatch at 12:16 PM. It was flagged as a routine call. And at that moment, 911 lit up with multiple reports of an explosion and fire. [phone ringing] 911 OPERATOR: 911. What are you reporting? MALE CALLER: I just had a house explode. [phone ringing] FEMALE CALLER: The house just blew up and it's on fire. [phone ringing] 911 OPERATOR: What are you reporting? FEMALE CALLER: I believe, fire. 911 OPERATOR: Where? KEITH MORRISON: The social worker who delivered the boys to Josh was back on the phone. SOCIAL WORKER: He exploded the house. 911 OPERATOR: Do you know if anyone's in the house? SOCIAL WORKER: Yes. There was a man and two children. I just dropped off the children and he wouldn't let me in the door. KEITH MORRISON: Chuck Cox heard the news from a friend who had seen it on Facebook. And when I got there, there were police cars, fire trucks. And I went to the line and the house was smoldering. And I still didn't believe it. KEITH MORRISON: And with the horror and disbelief came questions. Could this have been foreseen? Could Josh's evil plan somehow had been derailed? I feel strongly that the judge did everything possible to protect the boys. Josh did it. And I truly believe that when someone's committed to doing something this horrific, there is nothing anybody can do to stop them. He was going to do it. KEITH MORRISON: But could the children have been rescued in those final moments? Is someone to blame? Oh, it was horrible. I mean, this has been a nightmare. KEITH MORRISON: Fingers have been pointed at this man-
- Dave Loverack. He's the 911 dispatcher who caught the initial call that day. DAVE LOVERACK: What's the address? KEITH MORRISON: Just one of thousands in his 18 years on the job. To hear how clumsy and faltering I sounded. SOCIAL WORKER: The visit is with Josh Powell. DAVE LOVERACK: And who supervises? SOCIAL WORKER: And he's the husband that-
- I supervise. DAVE LOVERACK: So you supervise and you're doing the visit? SOCIAL WORKER: Yeah. I supervise-
- DAVE LOVERACK: You supervise yourself? SOCIAL WORKER: I supervise myself. I'm the supervisor here. DAVE LOVERACK: Wait a minute. If it's a supervised visit, you can't supervise yourself. It's almost painful because you know what's going to happen when you're listening to it. But at the time, you didn't know what was going to happen. DAVE LOVERACK: That's right. But as you listen to it now, what does it do to you? Oh, it's excruciating. It's painful to listen to. DAVE LOVERACK: And the dad's last name? SOCIAL WORKER: Powell. I was aware of Josh Powell's story, but I didn't associate his name. And so, his name was not resonating with me. DAVE LOVERACK: Two Ls at the end of Powell? SOCIAL WORKER: Yes. Realizing what we all know now, I wish I had recognized the urgency of the situation. You're all in a position which was, nobody could have imagined. Right. Because you don't automatically default to the notion that the person you're dealing with is a psychopath. It's difficult when one goes south on you like this one did. The Coxes don't blame Dave Loverack, not at all. And they've worked hard to stay calm, even after the loss of their grandsons, along with Josh and whatever he may have known about Susan. I think he was very selfish, and that's why he took the kids. [sighs] If he couldn't have them, no one could have them. I would have appreciated it if he had left a note telling us where Susan was or something, you know. Maybe the point was not to tell anyone. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm sure he wants for us to never find her. He's still mad at us, you know. And mad at us because we won't give up on our daughter, finding our daughter. KEITH MORRISON: Investigators have not given up either. They searched that storage unit of Josh's and recovered a comforter among Susan's belongings. Preliminary tests indicated blood stains on it. And Chuck Cox believes there is still one person who can answer his questions. His dad knows something. His dad had some part in this. KEITH MORRISON: Police have named Steven Powell a person of interest. Though he was far away when Susan disappeared, they have questions. Did he goad Josh into something? Did he devise or assist a cover up? Did his words help cause this? A police source say they grilled Steven relentlessly. His response was silence. And the parents of a sunny girl will never stop searching for her. Will never stop hurting. And yet-
- We could be mad at Josh and we could be mad at Steve. It's not anger, it's sadness. But there's hope. We believe that they're safe in another life with the Heavenly Father who knows what happened. And it will all be better, so we have that hope. In 2012, Steven Powell was convicted on 14 counts of voyeurism and sentenced to 2 and 1/2 years. He returned to prison in 2016 for a five-year sentence on a child pornography conviction. He has since been released. Meanwhile, after an investigation spanning more than three years and 11 states, police in Utah have halted their search for Susan Powell. That's all for this edition of Dateline. I'm Natalie Morales.
