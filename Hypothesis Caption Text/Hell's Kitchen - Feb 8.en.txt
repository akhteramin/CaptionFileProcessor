If not, you're gonna sell medium-rare pork again, <i> and I highly doubt</i> <i> anybody wants that.</i> ROE: Heather, come here. -Yeah, coming. ROE: Can you check that? If it's not good, throw it back in. GORDON: Why isn't he going? What are we waiting on? -We're waiting on pork. -Oh, [bleep]. -How long, pork? -Checking it now, Chef.

Chef, behind, chicken, wagyu. He told me he walked up chicken garnish followed by steak garnish. GORDON: [bleep] hell. Really? It's cold. We're serving cold [bleep] food. I need a little heat on this. -Be very careful. GORDON: Just touch it. -I don't want it overcooked. BRET: Heard, Chef. I know it's a wagyu, I get that, -but it's barely lukewarm. -Yes, Chef. Timing's way off. <i> BRET: I feel bad whenever</i> <i> I [bleep] up a food</i> or it's not 100% flawless the first time whether it's for Ariel, Chef, any customer, my clients, whatever. <i> I bring passion every time</i> <i> I step in that kitchen.</i> BRET: Chef, right behind to your left. -ARIEL: Thank you. -Get this on the plate.

JOSE: Two sea bass-
- -I want it perfect, Roe, okay? ROE: Yes, ma'am. -How long? -Five minutes, five minutes. -Five. -You need five? That's fine. -Yeah. Five. Guys, this is the last stretch, okay? -Let's finish strong. -Push it up. 'Cause I want you guys to nail it. We have a really good pace going, and it feels good, but I'm not celebrating just yet. Two sea bass, two churrasco, how long? You ready? I can go. Do you need a minute? ROE: I think I'm good. HEATHER: Okay. -Chef, coming in to the right. -Yep. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> -How long on that sea bass? -In my hand, Chef, walking. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Is that the best you can do, Roe? It's falling apart. It's falling apart. GORDON: Were you boiling it rapidly or steaming it? -Steaming it, Chef. -It looks terrible. I always have this problem that the minute I go under on something, I, like, overcompensate <i> on the next and go over.</i> Refire everything, guys-
- garnish, protein, everything. Heard. For some unknown reason, which I don't understand why, <i> Roe was the first pick</i> <i> last night,</i> <i> and I don't know if those</i> <i> are big shoes to fill or what,</i> <i> but she's dropping the ball.</i> How long for table four to come out, the main course, more or less? We're refiring it, everything fresh. -Okay. Perfect. -So I'd rather be a bit slower and perfect than send something that she's not happy with, right? -Okay, perfect. -Piss off. How long--two sea bass, two churrasco? Protein's walking. -How long, sea bass? TREV: Sea bass? <i> [Music] [Music]</i> It's okay? ROE: For the love of God. HEATHER: You good, Roe? -Are you happy with that? MIA: Yes. -Are you happy with that? -Yes, I'm happy with that. -Hallelujah. -That's what I'm talking about. Go. Follow with the broth. -This is the bass. -Oh, my God. All right, listen up, I'm firing a six-top. We're almost there, guys. Keep pushing. Two mackerel, two chicken, two wagyu. -Heard. -Got it. ARIEL: Guys, push for me, okay? MOTTO: Yes, Chef. Let's do it. Let's finish strong. Let's do it, yo. Come on, yo. -You guys are smashing this. -Got you. Service is going so great. We're almost there. <i> We're down</i> <i> to the last six-top.</i> -A-team, what, what? TREV: What? And let's finish as strong as we started. Where are we? Two mackerel, two chicken, two wagyu? TREV: How long on the mackerel? SCOTLEY: 90 seconds. I'll be there in 2 1/2 as long as garnish is ready. This six-top are the executives from the Six Flags Magic Mountain, and I think they looked after you last night, right? ALL: Yes, Chef. -Yes. Let's go. I'm taking your garnish on there. Heard. I'm bringing it right to you. -Hot behind. -Okay. Look, hit me with some vinegar here. Come on, A-Team. KANAE: A-Team. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Hey, Scotley, that mackerel is sexy, all right? -Nice job. -[smooches] For you, baby. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Bret, can I get a new chicken refire? GORDON: How burnt is that skin? -My fault, Chef. Sorry, Chef. -The mackerel is cooked. -Won't happen again, Chef. Come on, Bret. We're almost there. Put your big-boy pants on, and let's get this [bleep] rolling. -Bret, I need that chicken. -30 seconds. Let's go. I don't want to give it to you raw, Chef. I [bleep] up with the chicken, so I got to make sure that this chicken's proper, and, yabba dabba doo, -we keep it moving. -Bret, chicken? MOTTO: Come on, Bret. ARIEL: Let's go, Bret. The mackerel's been there two minutes. BRET: Chicken, hot pan. ARIEL: It's raw. GORDON: [bleep]. Bret! -Yes, Chef? -Look at me! -I would be freaking out. -Wake up! -I am awake, Chef! Yeah, well, if you were awake, you wouldn't be cooking [bleep] raw chicken!

We got a lot more things to do, and I am miles away from being ready, but for now, I'd like both of you to say good-bye to your brigades... ALL: Bye, guys. GORDON: And your sous chefs. -See you in a little bit? -Yep. ARIEL: Thank you. MIA: Thank you so much for tonight. Guys, head into the dining room. I'll see you there shortly. BRET: Hell, yeah, let's do it. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> GORDON: Scallops are cooked beautifully. I love what you did with the celery root. You've done something pretty magical. -Thank you, Chef. -Good job. GORDON: Just look at that--textbook. -Thank you, Chef. -The first recipient of the black jacket, congratulations, Ariel. -Thank you, Chef. -Great job. Thank you. Why do I have tuna? I need two beef tartare, not tuna tartare. Look at me. Well spotted. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> It's amazing. GORDON: I want to get to the end, and I want more. -Yes. MOTTO: Awesome. You did a really nice job on the steaming on this fish. I'll take the rest to go. This is a delicious dish. It is worthy of being on a menu right now in a restaurant. -Peanut butter. -Yes! -Good girl. -Nice work, Mia. -Four for four. -It doesn't look like lobster. You're absolutely right, well spotted. -It is monkfish. -Yes, Chef. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> MIA: This is it, girl. ARIEL: (laughing) I know. This is bananas. I'm having, like, an out-of-body experience right now. Yeah. I said in the beginning I thought Mia was my biggest competition, and I think that she overcame a lot of hurdles, but I think based on my performance <i> that I won Hell's Kitchen.</i> Let's get this over with. <i> I'm gonna beat Ariel</i> because I feel like we're at the same level as far as leadership goes. I feel like my dishes are more creative. So I definitely think I'm the next executive chef at the flagship Hell's Kitchen restaurant in Las Vegas. -(phone ringing) -Scared me. Hi, this is Mia. GORDON: Hi, Mia. I've made my decision. Can you and Ariel please make your way to my office? -Yes, Chef. -Thank you. He said make our way to his office. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> MIA: This is it, girl. MAN: Let's go, Mia! Let's go, Mia! Right, you two, welcome. Ariel, Mia, this has been an extremely difficult decision, let me tell you. Mia, never before have we had a chef that has performed so strongly across challenges. Above that, you've been one of the most creative chefs <i> we've ever had</i> <i> in Hell's Kitchen.</i> -Thank you, Chef. -Ariel... -Yes, Chef? -You have been <i> the most consistent chef</i> <i> across this</i> <i> entire competition,</i> <i> so it's no surprise to me</i> <i> that you are the only chef</i> <i> on either team</i> never to be considered for elimination. Ariel, right now how are you feeling? Ugh, my stomach is in knots, Chef, to be honest with you. <i> I'm just trying</i> <i> to contain myself</i> and maintain my calm that I've had all season. Mia, what's going through your mind? My heart is racing, but I'm just so proud <i> of what I've accomplished,</i> <i> and I'm really proud of myself,</i> and I'm so grateful for all the faith you've had in me. I could not be prouder of the two of you. In my eyes, you're both winners. BOTH: Thank you, Chef. Mia and Ariel, please step up in front of your doors. BOTH: Yes, Chef. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> <i> MIA: For me,</i> <i> everything is on the line.</i> This is what I want. I've been completely sure of myself. <i> I came to this competition</i> <i> to get here.</i> This is it. <i> ARIEL:</i> <i> This is a huge opportunity.</i> <i> This is the perfect</i> <i> next place for me to be.</i> It just feels so right that if it doesn't happen, I'm just gonna be so confused and just so bummed out. The chef whose door opens will become the winner of Hell's Kitchen and the executive chef of the flagship Hell's Kitchen restaurant <i> at Caesars Palace Las Vegas,</i> <i> with a salary</i> <i> of $1/4 million dollars.</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Both of you very carefully place your hand on top of your door handle. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> On the count of three, I want you to turn your handles. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> One, two... <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Three. <i> (cheers and applause)</i> Ahhh... Boommm! Wow! Lemme ask you a question, who is the play-maker of this new Big Mac with Bacon? It's the crispy bacon, of course. The flavor brings a whole new dimension to the game. Bacon does not win championships. Special Sauce wins championships, my friend! You're wrong. And I'm a doctor. Which means I'm always right. I'm gonna get a second opinion, from my mouth. <i> McDonald's Classics with</i> <i>Bacon, only for a limited time.</i> <i> Is it the best thing to</i> <i> happen to our Classics?</i> <i> Or to bacon?</i> <i> Try r yourself</i> <i> and decide.</i> This Valentine's Day, give her your heart.

[Music] Step it up. [Music] [Music] Always take the risk. [Music] Don't just watch it... Put your phone down and do it. [Music] Drip splash like the ice on the wrist. [Music] [Music] Brrt brrt brrt brrt [Music] [Music] that's a call I can't miss. [Music] Let's do. Sweat. Dedication. Cupcakes. I'm Michael Griffin. I'm Brian Orakpo. We played football together for the Titans. Now, we own a cupcake shop. We bake, we decorate. I love this new Surface Pro. It's light, it's sleek, it's fast. I'm able to draw what color frosting we want. We do a lot with social media. We have funny videos that we do in the bakery [laughs]. There's nothing that you can't do on this device. Cupcakes are a great business. Oh yeah, as long as you don't eat the profits! <i> (dramatic music)</i> The chef whose door opens will become the executive chef of the flagship Hell's Kitchen restaurant at Caesars Palace Las Vegas, with a salary of $1/4 million dollars. Good luck. On the count of three, I want you to turn your handles. One, two... <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Three. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> MAN: [bleep], yeah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Mia... Thank you, Chef. That was amazing. Well done. Thank you, Chef. You're gonna have a phenomenal career. -Thank you so much, Chef. -No doubt, okay? Thank you for the opportunity. I'm so proud to have gotten to this place as a rookie. You know, I knocked out everybody but one, and this isn't the end for me. Like, this is just the beginning. -(cheers and applause) -MAN: Yeah! I have been to Hell's Kitchen twice and made it out alive, and not only alive, but I made it out a winner, and this feels incredible right now. Um... (laughs) -Great job. -Thank you. Come on. Go down those stairs. They'd like to see you. Come on. Let's go. MAN: A-team! A-team! A-team! Oh, [bleep]! This job is made for me. I am the person who says every single day when I go to bed, How am I gonna be better than I was yesterday? Thank you. Thank you. <i> ARIEL: I dedicate winning</i> <i> to both my parents.</i> I'm happy to show my parents how far I've come. <i> Every time they see me succeed,</i> <i> it makes them feel happy.</i> Mia, I have so much respect for you. <i> I think that you</i> <i> are so talented,</i> and when I go to Las Vegas, if you want to come, if I have the position for you, it's yours. I would hire you in a heartbeat. Would you like to hear from the Hell's Kitchen winner? ALL: Yes! Come on. I am so [bleep] excited right now. (laughs) I'm sorry. I am so excited to work with this incredible woman right here, Chef Christina. I can't wait to work for you. I can't wait to work with you, Chef Jocky, and of course, Chef, I am very excited to show you -what I have in store, so... -Cannot wait. Thank you for this opportunity. Incredible, amazing, thank you. Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, our Hell's Kitchen winner, Ariel! <i> GORDON: Since the first time</i> <i> she was here,</i> <i> Ariel has grown tenfold</i> <i> as a chef.</i> <i> She is fiercely talented,</i> <i> extremely determined,</i> <i> and a commanding leader.</i> <i> I could not be more pleased</i> <i> to have her</i> <i> as my executive chef</i> <i> of Hell's Kitchen in Las Vegas.</i> One final thing to do-
