 THE BIG GAME FOR YOU.
 HEADLINES AROUND THE COUNTRY
 ARE SAYING NOT AGAIN REFERRING
 TO THE PATRIOTS LATEST SUPER
 BOWL WIN, THE NEW YORK POST RAN
 SUPER BOARD AND A DULL HALFTIME
 CHEST, WHAT WE DIDN'T NEED IS A
 SNOOZER BOWL, THE LOS ANGELES
 TIMES CALLED IT'S HOMETOWN TEAM
 LAMBS, NOT RAMS AFTER THEY LOST
 13-3.  PATRIOTS QUARTERBACK TOM
 BRADY PROVED HE'S A CHAMPION
 CELEBRATE AS HIS 6th WIN WITH
 THE KISS FROM HIS WIFE GISELE
 AND TOOK HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM
 TO THE STAGE WHEN THE TEAM WAS
 PRESENTED WITH THE VINCENT
 PARTY TROPHY.
 ONE THING EVERYONE AGREED ON WAS
 THE RENDITION OF THE NATIONAL
 ANTHEM WAS WIDELY APPLAUDED,
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 ♪ ♪ ♪ ONE THING THAT WAS
 ALMOST UNIVERSALLY CRITICIZED
 AND BECAME THE BUTT OF MANY
 SOCIAL MEDIA JOKES WAS MAROON
 5'S HALFTIME SHOW WHICH WAS
 CALLED CONVENTIONAL, TEPID IN
 THE MUSICAL EQUIVALENT OF A JAR
 OF MAYONNAISE.
 YOU BE THE JUDGE, CHECK OUT THE
 CLIP.
 ♪ ♪ ♪ AND TRAVIS SCOTT
 ALSO MADE A BRIEF APPEARANCE
 SINGING HIS HIT SONG SICKLE
 MODE, A LOT OF IT WAS BLEEPED
 OUT FOR CONTENT.
 BIG BOI MADE A GRAND ENTRANCE
 OUTKASTBUT IN REAL DIDN'T
 HAPPEN LIKE MAMA MUCH OF US
 HOPED AND SPONGEBOB FANS WERE
 HAPPY WHEN A CLIP OF SWEET
 VICTORY PLAYED BRIEFLY, FOR THE
 BIGGEST HALFTIME SHOW
 CONTROVERSY, THIS MOMENT WHEN
 ADAM LEVINE STRIPPED OF HIS TOP
 WITH MANY SAYING IT'S A DOUBLE
 STANDARD FOLLOWING THE BACKLASH
 JANET JACKSON RECEIVED AFTER
 ACCIDENTALLY EXPOSING ONE FOR
 BREASTS AND SPEAKING OF THE
 TANK TOP, TWITTER WAS QUICK TO
 POINT OUT OVER AND OVER THAT IT
 VERY CLEARLY RESEMBLES PEOPLE'S
 HOME DECOR LIKE THIS PILLOW,
 AND OTHERS WERE QUICK TO SHOW
 THAT ADAMS TATTOOS LOOK A LOT
 LIKE TRIPLE PLAY BAGS.
 ADAM IS RESPONDING TO ALL THE
 HATERS A POSTING INSTAGRAM
 SAYING WE THINK THE UNIVERSE
 FOR THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY
 TO PLAY ON THE WORLD'S BIGGEST
 STAGE AND WE THINK OUR FANS FOR
 MAKING OUR DREAMS POSSIBLE AND
 WE THINK CRITICS FOR ALWAYS
 PUSHING US TO DO BETTER.
 HE'S A LOT CLASSIER THAN I
 AM.
 I WOULD JUST TWEET BACK HEY
 I WAS DOING THE SUPER BOWL AND
 I MISS THESE TWEETS, WHAT WERE
 YOU DOING?
 HONESTLY, HE JUST OF THE SUPER
 BOWL AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
 AS AN ARTIST THAT'S THE
 PINNACLE.
 HE DID IT.
 OUT YOU ARE VERY HARD ON HIM
 AND MAROON 5 AND LAST NIGHT I
 WAS HONORED TO BE AT A SUPER
 BOWL PARTY WITH YOU.
 AS YOU SHOULD BE.
 WHILE I DID THINK THE SHOW
 WAS ENJOYABLE I FELT I WAS A
 LITTLE BIASED BECAUSE I SAW MY
 DAUGHTER DANCING AND THAT'S ALL
 I CARED ABOUT.
 I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE NO JOE,
 ELBOWS OUT COMING THROUGH THE
 CROWD, FRONT ROW, YOU ARE LIKE
 THAT WAS AWESOME.
 YOU THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST
 AWESOME EXPERIENCE YOU'VE EVER
 SEEN BASED ON YOUR REACTION.
 DADDY WAS FEELING NO PAIN.
 IT WAS SUCH A GOOD MOMENT, I
 LOOKED AROUND, I SAW LAWSON AND
 SOPHIE DANCING, YOUR 2 CHILDREN
 AND YOU ARE FEELING IT.
 WE HAVE THE VIDEO?  THERE IS
 SAM RIGHT THERE.
 SAME AS DANCING, YOU ARE
 FEELING IT.
 I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
 THERE IS LAWSON GETTING ON
 THE FLOOR.
 THAT'S WHAT'S UP.
 AND A SCENE.
 I HAVE TO ADMIT, I CAN ADMIT
 THERE WAS A BIT OF A BIAS LAST
 NIGHT, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE
 MOST INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE
 BECAUSE OF SOPHIE AND LAWSON
 BUT I WATCH THE BACK THIS
 MORNING AND IT WAS A LITTLE
 LACKLUSTER, JUST BEING HONEST.
 I KNOW YOU'RE WAITING FOR
 ME TO HATE ON IT BUT I LIKED
 IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIFIC,
 AND THE 5 MINUTE INTRO, WITH
 ALL THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS, GOOD
 FOR MAROON 5 FOR NOT FIRING
 BACK AND BEING POSITIVE, I
 THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT SHOW,
 EVERYONE WANTS EVERYONE TO PUSH
 THE LINE AND THIS IS WHAT
 AMERICA NEED IT, THERE WAS NO
 POLITICS, I THOUGHT IT WAS A
 GREAT SHOW.
 HE IS 39, IF I LOOK LIKE THAT I
 WOULD DO THE SHOW WITH NO SHIRT
 ON RIGHT NOW.
 I THOUGHT HE DID A GREAT JOB.
 AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT, I
 THOUGHT HE DID A GREAT JOB.
 ALL THE HATERS GET REAL.
 T-BONE.

 I DON'T WANT TO BE HATER.
 BE HONEST WHAT DID YOU
 THINK?
 I THINK I HALFTIME SHOW YOU
 SHOULD BE AT THE BEST OF YOUR
 VERY BEST I THINK HE WAS
 LACKLUSTER AND NON-ENERGETIC
 AND SEEMED PERFECTLY UNHAPPY TO
 BE HONEST.
 I WOULD'VE BEEN SO EXCITED TO
 COME HERE AND BE LIKE MAROON 5.
 THEY DID GREAT.
 I WAS SUPER BORED AND
 DISAPPOINTED.
 THAT'S HOW I FELT.
 THAT'S FINE.
 EVERYONE IS COMPLAINING SO
 MUCH, GOOD LUCK NEXT YEAR WHEN
 THERE'S NO SUPER BOWL HALFTIME
 SHOW, LIKE THE OSCARS WITH NO
 HOST THIS YEAR.
 NO HOST FOR THE OSCARS.
 WHY WOULD THERE NOT BE A
 SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW?
 WHO WILL PERFORM.
 NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO, YOU
 WANT ELVIS TO COME UP FROM THE
 GRAVE?
 TO BE HONEST I WANTED LADY
 GAGA WHO JUMPED OFF HER PRINCE
 WHO SANG WITH AMAZING
 PERFORMANCES, YOU HAVE TO OWN
 IT.
 HOW MANY PRINCES AND LADY
 GAGA'S ARE THERE?
 I THINK HE OWNED IT, IT
 DOESN'T MEAN I'M A HORRIBLE
 PERSON PER
 YOU'RE KIND OF INSINUATING
 THAT.
 SHARE YOUR COMMENTS ON THE
 BIG GAME LATER ON 5th HOST BUT
 FOR NOW WE WILL SWITCH GEARS TO
 HARDER NEWS, CALLS FROM BOTH
 SIDES OF THE AISLE FOR
 VIRGINIA'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR
 TO RESIGN, KELLY SCHUBERTH HAS
 MOVED NEWS OF THE MOMENT.
 THE WALLS CLOSING IN ON THE
 GOVERNOR VIRGINIA AFTER RECESS
 PHOTO FROM HIS 1984 MEDICAL
 SCHOOL YEARBOOK SURFACED.
 HERE'S A LOOK SHOWING ONE
 PERSON IN BLACK FACE AND
 ANOTHER IN A WHITE HOOD,
 SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS RELEASED
 HE ADMITTED IT WAS HIM IN THE
 PHOTO BUT THEN IN A PRESS
 CONFERENCE OVER THE WEEKEND HE
 CHANGED HIS STORY SAYING HE DID
 NOT WEAR THE COSTUME AND IT'S
 DEFINITELY NOT HIM IN THE PHOTO
 , AND HE'S SORRY BECAUSE IT
 SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED
 IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 I WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON THE
 DEVELOPING STORY.
 WE WON'T GET INTO IT BUT WE
 CAN AGREE THIS GUY HAS TO STEP
 DOWN?
 IT'S UNACCEPTABLE, STEP
 DOWN.
 ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD BE
 HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD, GET
 OUT OF THERE.
 THAT'S A LOW STANDARD,
 DON'T WEAR BLACK FACE.
 YES.
 WE HAVE VERY SAD NEWS FOR
 ALL OR SOAP OPERA FANS, YOUNG
 AND THE RESTLESS STAR KRISTOFF
 ST. JOHN FOUND DEAD YESTERDAY
 IN HIS HOME IN LOS ANGELES, HE
 WAS 52.
 HE PLAYED THE CHARACTER NEIL
 WINTERS ON THE SOAP SINCE 1991,
 HE WAS NOMINATED FOR 9 DAYTIME
 EMMYS AND 110 DOUBLE ACP AWARDS
 FOR HIS PORTRAYAL, THERE IS NO
 WORD ON THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH,
 HE LOST HIS SON JULIAN ST. JOHN
 TO SUICIDE IN 2014, THIS ONE
 HURTS BECAUSE I'M A HUGE YOUNG
 AND THE RESTLESS FAN AND I FEEL
 LIKE I GREW UP WITH NEIL, I
 KNEW HIM AND I KNOW A LOT OF OUR
 DBL NATION AND FANS PROBABLY
 FEEL THE SAME.
 SOAP OPERAS ARE SO WEIRD,
 YOU SEE IT MINUTELY DAY BY DAY,
 MY MOM'S BEST FRIEND SOUGHT
 EVERY DAY IN HER SHOP, WHEN ONE

 WELCOME BACK TO DBL TIME FOR
 TODAY'S 5th HOST, THE INTERNET
 IS ON FIRE WITH COMMENTS ABOUT
 THE SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW.
 EVEN WITH THE HELP OF TRAVIS
 SCOTT, BIG BOI AND SPONGEBOB,
 CRITIC'S BLASTING MAROON 5'S
 PERFORMANCE IN ADAM LEVINE FOR
 BEING SHORT LIST.
 DESPITE HARSH CRITICS LIVING
 RESPONDED BY THINKING THE
 UNIVERSE ALONG WITH A LAUNDRY
 LIST OF WORDS INCLUDING
 FORGIVE, LAUGH, CRY, SMILE AND
 INTO HER.
 DBL NATION WE WANT TO KNOW YOUR
 TAKE ON THE HALFTIME SHOW,
 LET'S GET YOUR COMMENTS.
  RENI SAYS THE MOST
 ENTERTAINING PART OF THE SUPER
 BOWL WERE IN THE LADIES.
 GLADYS KNIGHT AND THE SISTERS
 CHLOE AND HALEY.
 THE NATIONAL ANTHEM WAS
 BEAUTIFUL, RENI, YOU HIT IT OUT
 OF THE PARK YOU ARE RIGHT.
 I THOUGHT GLADYS KNIGHT STOLE
 THE SHOW, HEARING HER VOICE,
 THE NATIONAL TREASURE IS ALWAYS
 BEEN HERE.
 YOU KIND OF FORGET.
 I WILL GO STREAM SOME GLADYS
 KNIGHT TONIGHT.
 CARRY FROM FACEBOOK SAYS I
 LOVED MAROON 5, YOU CAN'T
 PLEASE ANYONE, ADAM LEVINE
 ROCKED, MY SISTER SO MAD, SHE
 LOVED IT.
 IF YOU'RE STEPPING UP STEP IT
 UP AND I DIDN'T THINK THEY DID.
 SELENA FROM FACEBOOK SAYS
 IT WAS THE WORST HALFTIME SHOW
 EVER.
 ADAM LEVINE IS NOT CUTE OR SEXY.
 WE COULD'VE DONE WITHOUT THE
 RHYTHM WITH MOVES.
 HE DIDN'T HAVE MOVE LIKE
 JAGER?
 APPARENTLY NOT.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M SHOCKED,
 SOCIAL MEDIA IS A NASTY PLACE
 BUT I'M SURPRISED BY HOW MUCH
 PEOPLE HATED THIS PERFORMANCE.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED,
 WHAT DO YOU WANT AND WHO DO YOU
 WANT?
 THE MORE YOU CRITICIZE PEOPLE
 LIKE THIS THE LESS PEOPLE WILL
 BE INTERESTED IN DOING A
 HALFTIME SHOW.
 I KNOW SAM THINKS IT'S A MUTE
 POINT BUT WE DON'T HAVE A HOST
 FOR THE OFFICERS BECAUSE OF
 THIS POINT.
 GOOD LUCK BASHING EVERYONE WHO
 DOES EVERYTHING EVER IN THEIR
 LIFE.
 YOU HAVE A GREAT POINT OUT.
 MAYBE IT'S REPETITION AND I'M
 FINALLY LISTENING BUT I THINK
 YOU A VALID POINT.
 IT'S ONE SHOW.
 YOU ARE WELCOME.
 THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
 IT WAS A GOOD POINT THE
 FIRST TIME WE ALWAYS JUMP ON
 TORY'S BANDWAGON AND I'M THE
 BAD GUY.
  YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE A DEER
 IN HEADLIGHTS.
 WHEN I'M IN THE
 CONVERSATION AND TORY DISAGREES
 MAYBE ONE TIME SAY HEY TORY
 JEFF IS LITTLE RIGHT.
 I AM SORRY I JUST HAVE TO
 SAY, WHEN YOU ARE LIKE WHAT DID
 YOU WANT, I WANTED TO BE WELL
 AND I THINK IT'S OKAY TO WANT
 THAT.
 IT'S OKAY TO WANT THAT.
 IS SOMEONE CAME TO YOU IN
 THEIR LIKE WE WILL GIVE YOU A
 FREE SHOW, ADAM LEVINE,
 MULTIMILLION DOLLAR SET UP,
 WE'LL BRING BIG BOI AND TRAVIS
 SCOTT AND EVERYONE'S LIKE  I'M
 OVER IT.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT?
 IT'S FREE ENTERTAINMENT.
 HE LOOKED TERRIFIC, I DON'T
 KNOW.
 HE DOES LOOK GREAT.
 WAS THE WORD, NOT
 SPORTSMANSHIP, STAGE PRESENCE.
 SHOWMANSHIP COST THANK YOU,
 I DON'T THINK IT WAS THERE.
 BECAUSE HE'S ONLY BEEN
 PERFORMING 25 YEARS.
 THAT'S MY OPINION AND I'M
 STICKING TO IT.
 YOU CAN I'M JUST SAYING I'M
 SURPRISED HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE
 OUTRAGED.
 ON THE GETS FINE.
 HOW MANY TIMES WILL PEOPLE
 KEEP REPEATING THEMSELVES.
