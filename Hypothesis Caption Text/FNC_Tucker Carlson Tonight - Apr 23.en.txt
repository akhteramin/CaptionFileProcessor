 Shannon: A DRAMATIC RESCUE CAUGHT ON CAMERA, 221-YEAR-OLD
 KAYAKING WHEN THEY CAPSIZED IN
 CHILLY WATERS.
 IT WAS HOURS BEFORE CALIFORNIA
 HIGHWAY PATROL HELICOPTER
 FINALLY FOUND THEM.
 RESCUERS CREDITING THE
 LIFEJACKETS THEY HAD ON SAYING
 THEY PLAYED A VITAL ROLE TO KEEP
 THEM■ ALIVE.
 WE ARE GLAD YOU SPENT YOUR
 EVENING WITH US, GOOD NIGHT FROM
 WASHINGTON.
 I AM SHANNON BREAM.

 Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND
 WELCOME TO
 "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT."
 THE HOLIEST DAY OF THE CHRISTIAN
 CALENDAR TURNED TO TRAGEDY
 YESTERDAY AS YOU KNOW I
 SRI LANKA.
 THE COORDINATED ATTACK, SUICIDE
 BOMBERS STRUCK THREE CATHOLIC
 CHURCHES AND■ HOTELS THE66
 AT LEAST 290 PEOPLE WERE
 MURDERED AND HUNDREDS MORE WERE
 INJURE
 THE ATTACKERSAF WERE AFFILIATED
 WITH A LOCAL TERROR GROUP.
 THERE WERE RADICAL MUSLIMS,
 THEIR MOTIVES WERE R■■
 THEIR TARGETS WERE CHRISTIANS.
 NONE OF THAT IS SPECULATION.
 IT IS TRUE.
 MAYBE BECAUSE IT IS SO TRUE AND
 SO OBVIOUSLY TRUE NOBODY IN
 BVAUTHORITY WANTED TO SAY IT OUT
 LOUD SO INSTEAD THEY WENT TO
 GREAT LENGTHS TO AVOID THE CLEAR
 LANGUAGE.
 THE ATTACKS ON EASTER WORSHIPERS
 ARE AN ATTACK ON HUMANITY
 TWEETED BARACK OBAMA.
 HILLARY CLINTON USED THE SAME
 PHRASE.
 "I AM PRAYING FOR EVERYONE
 AFFECTED BY THE HORRIFIC ATTACK
 AND TRAVELERS IN SRI LANKA.
 EASTER WORSHIPERS."
 WHY DON'T YOU SAY CHRISTIANS?
 NOBODY WORSHIPS EASTER.
 THERE IS A REASON, OF COURSE,
 EUPHEMISMS ARE NEVER ACTUAL.
 OUR LEADERS BELIEVE CHRISTIANS
 ARE THE PROBLEMS, THE DANGEROUS
 ONES WHO CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
 TELL THEM THE TRUTH AND THEY
 MIGHT GO CRAZYZYND AND ORGANIZEA
 NEW CRUSADE.
 MARCH ON JERUSALEM.
 YOU NEVER KNOW WITH CHRISTIANS.
 JUST TONIGHT THE
 "THE WASHINGTON POST" RAN A
 STORY WITH THIS HEADLINE,
 "SRI LANKA CHURCH BOMBING ANGER
 IN WEST."
  TOIVE TO BE A NAZI
 BE UPSET ABOUT CHURCH BOMBINGS.
 THAT IS WHY OUR LEADERS IGNORE
 THE PERSECUTIONS OF CHRISTIANS
 AROUND T WHEN U.S.FFCY CONTRIBUT
 PERSECUTION. O
 AND IT DOES, THEY SAY NOTHING
 ABOUT IT.
 LESS THAN 20 YEARS AFTER WE
 OVERTHREW SADDAM HUSSEIN, THREE
 QUARTERS OF IRAQ'S ONE THRIVING
 CHRISTIAN POPULATION IS GONE.
 THEY HAVE EITHER BEEN MURDEREDEY
 ISIS IN SOME CASES
 ORVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF
 THE P COUNTRY AS REFUGEES.
 IN SYRIA CHRISTIANS HAVE LIVED
 UNDER GENERATIONS UNDER
 PROTECTI OF THE BASHARAL-ASSAD .
 TRUE, IT IS TRUE AND YOU CAN
 TALK TO THE HUNDREDS OF
 THOUSANDS OF CHRISTIANS WHO FLED
 THE COUNTRY SINCE THE U.S. BEGAN
 SUPPORTING THE DISMISSAL BASHAR
 AL-ASSAD.TH
 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW DETAILS.
 NOBODY IN THE MEDIA EVER ASKS
 THEIR OPINION AND NOBODY CARES.
  SO MANY OF OURAT
 ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
 COUNTRIES THAT RECEIVE BILLIONS
 REPRESS CHRISTIANITY.
 AFGHANISTAN FOR EXAMPLE RECEIVES
 BILLIONS FROM US EVERY YEAR.
 FOWHY?
 SO WE CAN TURN IT INTO BELGIUM.
 RIGHT NOW IN AFGHANISTAN
 CONVERTING TO CHRISTIANITY
 CARRIES A DEATH SENTENCE IF YOU
 ARE MUSLIM, THE SAME IS TRU■■■Uñ
 BOTH COUNTRIES BACKED B
 UNITED STATES.
 IN EGYPT CONVERSION IS
 RESTRICTED ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T
 CARRY DEATH, POLLS SHOW THAT
 MOST OF THE PUBLIC WISHES IT
 DID.
 WHERE IS OUR STATE DEPARTMENT?
 THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING
 AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OFON PEOPLEN
 COUNTRIES WE CAN PRONOUNCE.
 THEY IGNORE IT.
 ONE WAS THE LAST TIME THE U.S.
 PUSHED ANOTHER COUNTRY TO
 COUNTRY CHRISTIANS BETTER?
 IN SOME CASES IT'S PRETTY EASY
 TO DO THAT, WE COULD DEMAND THAT
 ON US IMPLEMENT FULL FREEDOM OF
 RELIGION BEFORE WE GIVE THEM ANY
 MORE USAID.
 WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?
 BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF BEING
 CRITICIZED BY
 "THE WASHINGTON POST."
 THE FOUNDER OF PULLIAM AND THE
 AUTHOR OF A RADICAL, MY JOURNEY
 OUT OF EXTREMISM.
 AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT.
 WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU.
 EXPLAIN IF THE THINKING BEHIND
 NOT JUST BEING STRAIGHTFORWARD
 WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT AN EVENT
 LIKE THE ONE WE SAW YESTERDAY IN
 SRI LANKA.
 I AM A MUSLIM AND I EXPRESS
 MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO
 CHRISTIANS AROUND THE WORLD DUE
 TO THIS AND AFTER THIS HORRIFIC
 TERRORIST ATTACK IN SRI LANKA
 THAT CLAIMED NEARLY 300 LIVES.
 MANY DON'T'S KNOW THIS, BUT I AM
 MARRIED TO ANAL AMERICAN FROM A
 CATHOLIC FAMIL'S WHY
 IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ME
 PERSONALLY TO MAKE THIS POINT.
 UNFORTUNATELY, OUR LEADERS AND
 IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE
 POLITICAL LEADERS THAT YOU HAVE
 NAMED OUR SUFFERING FROM WHAT I
 BELIEVE IS AN INTELLECTUAL AND
 MORAL RETREAT FROM OUR
 ENLIGHTENMENT VALUES AND ALSO A
 LEVEL OF POLITICAL CYNICISM
 INVOLVED HERE AS WELL.
 THE INTELLECTUAL SIDE FOR, A
 WHILE NOW WHETHER WHEN
 BARACK OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT OR
 EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN
 UNABLE --
 I CALL IT THE VOLDEMORT EFFECT.
 THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO NAME
 EXTREMISM BY NAME AND JIHADIST
 TERRORISM, A VIOLENT
 MANIFESTATION BECAUSE I
 GENUINELY BELIEVEIC THAT A BIGGR
 THREAT TO THEIR POLITICAL
 PERSPECTIVE IS WHITE SUPREMACYCY
 AND FAR RIGHT EXTREMISM AND THEN
 OF COURSE THERE IS THE PRAGMATIC
 POLITICAL SIDE OF THINGS.
 THEY ARE PANDERING TO A CERTAIN
 VOTE BASE AND I THINK THAT BY
 NAMING THESE THINGS EVEN IF THEY
 WANTED TO, IT WOULD TROUBLE WITH
 THEIR BASE AND TOT HOW I
 OPERATE AND I THINK ANY HUMAN
 BEING SHOULD OPERATE.
 WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW ZEALAND WAS
 A TERRORLA ATTACK AND WHAT HAS
 HAPPENED IN SRI LANKA IS A
 JIHADIST HOTTEST TERROR ATTACK
 AND IT MOVES US ALL TO SPEAK
 PLAINLY ABOUT THIS SO
 WE CAN ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.
 Tucker: WHAT DOES THAT SAY
 ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THEIR
 OWN POPULATIONS AND THE SUPPOSED
 DEMOCRACY?
 THEY CAN'T BE STRAIGHTFORWARD.
  HAN AMERICANS CAN'T
 IDEA OF KNOWING THAT ISLAMIC
 EXTREMISTS DID THIS AND STILL,
 NOT HATE ALL MUSLIMS?
 THEY HAVE A LOW OPINION OF THEIR
 OWN POPULATION.
 "THE WASHINGTON POST" THAT
 YOU REFERENCED, THEY FEAR A FAR
 RIGHT BACKLASH AND I HAVE READ
 THE ARTICLE IN QUESTION AND IT
 SELECTS ONLY THOSE WHO ARE FROM
 THE RIGHT OF THE POLITICAL
 SPECTRUM AND THEIR REACTIONS TO
 THE TERROR ATTACK IN SRI LANKA.
 IT IS VERY EASY TO DO THAT BY
 THE WAY, LAZY BAIT JOURNALISM.
 I ADVISED FELLOW JOURNALIST NOTE
 TO DO THAT.
 AFTER THE NEW ZEALAND TERROR
 ATTACK I COULD HAVE SAID THAT
 THE EAST FEARS A BACKLASH FROM
 JIHADISTS AND I COULD HAVE HAND
 SELECTED AND HAD ONLY REACTIONS
 TO THE NEW ZEALAND ATTACK TO TRY
 TO PORTRAY THE FACT THAT ONLY
 THE JIHADISTS AND ISLAMISTS WERE
 UPSET.
 IT IS A DISHONEST WAY TO SHOW
 THAT.
 I THINK SADLY TOO MANY PEOPLE
 PLAY POLITICS WITH TRAGEDY AND
 THEY ALLOW FOR THEIR OWN
 FRAMEWORK OF THEIR OWN BIAS TO
 INFLUENCE HOW THEY VIEW HUMAN
 TRAGEDY AND THEN THEY USE THAT
 TO PEDDLE THEIR OWN POLITICAL
 NARRATIVE.
 WEke SHOULD ALL BE AS CONSISTENT
 AS POSSIBLE.
 Tucker: AND STOP LYING,
 THAT MAKES EVERYONE CYNICAL AND
 IT CAUSES THE YOU FEAR.
 THANK YOU.
 A WISE VOICE AS ALWAYS.
 NINA SHEA IS A RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
 EXPERT AT THE HUDSON INSTITUTE
 HERE IN WASHINGTON AND SHE JOINS
 US TONIGHT.
 I WOULD SAY THAT IT UNDERSELLS
 WHAT YOU DO.
 YOU ARE THE MOST CONSISTENT AND
 THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE EXPERTS
 ON THE PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS
 AROUND THE WORLD.
 THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR
 FOCUSING ON THIS ISSUE.
 Tucker: GIVE US AN OVERVIEW
 OF THE PICTURE?
 LET ME JUST SAY THAT FIRST
 THIS■ES JUST TO
 THOSE NS WHO WERE
 ATTACKED AND KILLED OVER THE■n
 WEEKEND OVER EASTER WEEKEN
 IT WSAGE THAIS
 BASICALLY A WAR ON CHRISTIA/p/pp
 FROM A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE
 MUSLATION.
 THE MUSLIM EXTREMIST POPULATION.
 OVER THE LAST DECADE IN PLACES
 LIKE EGYPT WHES WHO
 WAS AN ANALYST THERE, HE
 ESTIMATES THERE ARE ABOUT 500
 CHURCH ATTACKS IN THE LAST
 COUPLE OF YEARS.
 THESE OCCURRED ON PALM SUNDAY, A
 COORDINATED ATTACK A COUPLE OFOF
 YEARS AGO.
 ON CHRISTIANS IN DECEMBER AROUND
 CHRISTMAS TIME AT THE SEAT OF
 ST. MARK'S CATHEDRAL.
 I WAS JUST THERE AND SAW THAT
 SITE.
 IT IS HEARTBREAKING.
 IT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN.
 Tucker: WHERE IS
 UNITED STATES STATE DEPARTMENT?
 IT IS NOT SAYING ENOUGH.
 THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT TENDS TO
 GO AFTER THE BOMBING ATTACKS
 THAT ISIS DOES BUT THERE ARE
 EXTREMIST MUSLIMS IN THE LOCAL
 NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ARE ATTACKING
 CHURCHES WITH IMPUNITY AND HAVE
 BEEN FOR QUITE A WHILE A WHILE
 IN EGYPT.HI
 ABOUT 10% OF THE POPULATIONS ARE
 CHRISTIANS THERE.
 NIGERIA ESTIMATED 900 CHURCH
 ATTACKS IN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD.
 THESE ARE AGAIN HAPPENING ONóóóV
 CHRISTMAS, ON EASTER, IT DOESN'T
 MATTER WHAT STRIPE OF
 CHRISTIANITY YOU ARE, ACROSS THE
 BOARD.
 Tucker: POWERFUL CHURCHES
 FOR THE UNITED STATES, RICH
 CHURCH IS FOR SURE, POWERFUL
 CLERGYMEN, I DON'T HEAR THIS
 ISSUE ADDRESSED.
 WHY IS THAT?
 I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE
 AWARE OF IT.
 SOME OF THEM ARE AFRAID THAT
 THEY WILL GET RETRIBUTION BY THE
 EXTREMISTS, BUT THEY DON'T TALK
 ABOUT ITLK IN THOSE COUNTRIES.
 THERE ARE VARIED REASONS WHY
 PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT BUT
 THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION IS
 SECURITY.
 WE NEED TO PROMOTE THAT.
 IN FACT THE UNITED STATES DID
 GIVE A QUIET WARNING TO
 SRI LANKA THAT CHURCHES WOULD BE
 ■@■@F THEY DIDN'T ACT.
 AND THEY DID NOT HEED IT.ST
 WE NEED TO ELEVATE THIS.
 Tucker: WE HAVE GIVEN
 BILLIONS TO AFGHANISTAN BUT YOUN
 ■■HINKNK THAT WOULD AT LEAST
 BUY US, THE MAJORITY CHRISTIAN
 COUNTRY A CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT
 WOULD MAKE IT A DEATH PENALTY
 OFFENSE TO CONVERT..
 WHY WOULD WE FUND A GOVERNMENT
 LIKE THAT?
 WHILE WE HAD OUR TROOPS THERE
 THEY BROKE THE LEASE IN THE LAST
 CHURCH OF THE COD CLOSED
 IT.
 WE DON'T.
 WE SELL OURSELVES SHORT.
 WE DON'T EVER DIVIDE CHRISTIANS.
 WE ALWAYS HAVE A HIGHER PRIORITY
 REGARDING TARIFFS BUT WE DON'T
 UNDERSTAND THERE IS A LINK
 BETWEEN THE TWO.
 THE WEAKNESS OF THOSE CHRISTIANS
 FEEDS THIS.
 IT MAKES THEM A SOFT TARGET.
 THE GOVERNMENT'S DON'T FEEL LIKE
 ANY PRESSURE COMING FROM US.
 THEY FEEL PRESSURE COMING FROM
 ONE SIDE, THE EXTREMISTS.
 Tucker: THAT IS SUCH A
 SMART POINT, THERE IS A LINK.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 THE MUELLER REPORT CAME OUT LAST
 WEEK, NO COLLUSION, NO CRIME,
 DEMOCRATS ARE STILL TALKING
 ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.
 WILL THEY DO IT?
 OWWE TALKED TO SOMEONE WHO MIGHT
 KNOW THE ANSWER, AFTER THE
 BREAK.

    ■■■■■37■■/■■■■O■O■O■■O■C%C%■s

 Tucker: DEMOCRA HAVE NOW
 HAD A FULL WEEKEND TO READ THE
 MUELLER REPORT TO LOVINGLY SAVOR
 EVERY WORD, TO DIGEST IT.■
 DOES IT HAVE, AND THIS IS THE
 KEY QUESTION, FROM DATE■
 KEY QUESTION,TI THE CRIMES WE HE
 BEEN HEARING ABOUT FOR TWO YEARS
 THAT WOULD JUSTIFY HIRING A
 SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND AFTER
 HAVING DONE THAT IT WOULD
 JUSTIFY IMPEACHMENT?
 DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
 MAKE A DECISION ON THAT.
 LAWMAKERS AND PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES ARE IGNORING THE■
 REPORTS ACTUAL CONCLUSION THAT
 LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY BE DEMANDING
 IMPEACHMENT ANYWAY.
 I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS
 REPORT YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS
 ENOUGH INFORMATION THERE, NOT
 ONLY ON OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
 BUT ALSO ON COLLUSION OR
 CONSPIRACY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
 CALL IT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH
 IMPEACHMENT ON THIS PRESIDENT.
 WE ARE NOT FARTHER AWAY FROM
 IMPEACHMENT.
 IF ANYTHING YOU READ THIS
 DOCUMENT AND YOU FIGURE OUT HOW
 WE WILL HOLD THIS PRESIDENT
 ACCOUNTABLE.
 DO THINK THIS IS IMPEACHABLE?
 YEAH, I DO.D
 I THINK IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY
 REASONABLE FOR THEM TO OPEN UP
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS.
 IT IS TIME FOR IMPEACHMENT.
 Tucker: YOU HEARD IT. IT IS TIME FOR IMPEACHMENT.
 HE JOINS US, THANK YOU FOR
 COMING ON.
 WHEN DOES IMPEACHMENT START?
 I HAVE GONE BOTH WAYS MYSELF
 AND HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 PEOPLE CAN MAKE FUN OF IT, WE
 KNOW INDISPUTABLY THAT
 DONALD TRUMP WON WITH THE HELP
 OF A HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER AND
 THAT HE KNEW HE WAS GETTING THAT
 HELP AND HE ACTUALLY SOLICITED
 THE HELP.
 HE DID NOTHING TO ALERT
 AUTHORITIES TO IT AND HE HAS
 DONE ZERO TO KEEP IT FROM
 HAPPENING AGAIN.
 Tucker: YOU ANSWERED YOUR
 OWN QUESTION.
 WHEN IS THAT STARTING?
 WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THREE
 YEARS TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM,.
 THE NOMINATION AND THEN THE
 ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND THEN WE
 WILL IMPEACH HIM.
 YEARS HAVE GONE BY AND WE HAVE
 THE REPORT, LET'S STOP MESSING
 AROUND.
 ONE IS IMPEACHMENT?
 YOU ONLY GO FORWARD WITH ANY GRAND JURY WITH AN IMPEACHMENT
 WHICH IS THE ACCUSATION, NOT A
 TRIAL BY VIRTUE OF HAVING THE
 EVIDENCE AND THATTH WILL BE HAVG
 DON JR.. AND ROGER STONE COME
 FORWARD.
 Tucker: IT IS NOT LIKE WE
 WILL LEARN STORY CHANGING FACTS
 FROM THE REDUCTIONS.
 THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS
 THAT MUELLER DIDN'T GET.
 Tucker: I'M BEING
 DISINGENUOUS, WE BOTH KNOW HE IS
 NOT BEING IMPEACHED,WE BOTH KNOW
 THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TO HAVE IT
 BOTH WAYS WHERE THEY CAN PRETENS
 IT'S SERIOUS ENOUGH TO MERIT
 IMPEACHMENT BUT THEY DON'T WANT
 THAT BECAUSE THEY WILL LOSE AND
 BE PUNISHED BY VOTERS.
 I DISAGREE WITH THAT.
 THE DEMOCRATS WON FIVE SEATS,
 GEORGE W BUSH WROTE THAT ABOUT
 HOW HE WILL HAVE A CLEANER
 WHITE HOUSE AND I WOULD SAY
 JIMMY CARTER TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
 WITH THE NIXON IMPEACHMENT.
 Tucker: WHY NOT DO IT?
 THE QUESTION ON WHETHER IT IS
 A RIGHT OR WRONG THING.
 Tucker: YOU CAN'T TELL THE
 PUBLIC FOR THREE YEARS THAT THE
 GUY IS A NAZI.
 HE'S A TRADER.
 HE'S WORKING WITH A HOSTILE
 POWER.
 EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR YEARS WE
 HAVE HEARD THIS BUT WE CAN'T
 IMPEACH HIM BECAUSE WE CAN'T
 CONVINCE THE SENATE?
 THAT AS A WHOLE ANOTHER
 THING.
 THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE
 HOUSE WILL BRING THESE PEOPLE IN
 AND MAYBE THEY WILL GET ACCESS
 TO ALL OF THESE BOXES OF
 EVIDENCE AND MAYBE NOT AND MAYBE
 THEY HAVE TO BASICALLY BRING
 EVERYBODY ELSE UNDER OATH.
 IS IT A WASTE OF TIME?
 IF YOU TAKE THE WATERGATE
 HEARINGS AND IF YOU THINK THEY
 WERE A WASTE OF TIME THEN YOU
 WOULD THINK THESE ARE TOO.
 MOST PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC,
 PERSONALLY I WAS.
 IS WATERGATE AND I DON'T THIS
 K IN THE
 HAPPEN AT ALL AND I THINK WHAT
 DEMOCRATS A ARE ACTUA
 MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO AT
 LEAST THINK THROUGH HOW TO HELP
 THE COUNTRY IN SOME TANGIBLE WAY
 BEFORE THEY GET BEAT INEVITABLY
 ORE IN A PRESIDENTIAL
 RACE.
 THAT IS WHERE WE ARE GOING.
 WORSE THAN WATERGATE IN A
 SENSE THAT THERE IS NOT JUST A
 HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER BUT
 DONALD TRUMP LAUGHING ABOUT IT,
 IT IS ALMOST AN INDICATION FOR
  -- INVITATION FOR
 CHINA AND NORTH KOREA TO DO THE
 SAME THING.
 Tucker: RUSSIA IS NOT A
 THREAT TO US.
 IF YOU THINK THEIR COUNTRIES
 THAT ARE THERE AND LOOKING THE
 OTHER WAY DO NOTHING, WHAT IS
 GOING TO STOP CHINA?
 Tucker: THE MOST ANTI-CHINA
 PRESIDENT IS IN CHARGE OF THAT?
 HE IS INVITING IT.
 NEXT TIME HELP HIM IF IT WORKS
 FOR HIM.
 Tucker: AMAZING.
 HERMAN CAIN A CANDIDATE TO SERVE
 UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE, HE
 DIDN'T WITHDRAW BECAUSE HE WAS
 INCOMPETENT ORR  CYNICAL BECAUSE
 HE WAS SHOWN AS A UNSUITABLE
 PICK, HE DROPPED HIS BID BECAUSE
 HE WAS BLACKMAILED.
 INTO DOING THAT.
 ATTORNEY GLORIA TEAMED UP AND
 SAID THEY WOULD EXPOSE HIM TO
 PUBLIC HUMILIATION UNLESS HE
 WITHDREW HIS NAME.
 IF ASKED AT THE UNITED STATES
 SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE
 HEARING, HE WILL ALSO BE WILLING
  HTO IDENTIFY CERTAIN PARTS OF S
 BODY TO COOPERATE HER TESTIMONY.
 THIS TESTIMONYRA WILL NOT BE
 NECESSARY IF MR. CAIN WITHDRAWS
 HIS NAME FROM THE VETTING B
 PROCESS AND OR THE PRESIDENT
 DECIDES NOT TO FORMALLY NOMINATE
 HIM.
 Tucker: JASON NICHOLS IS A
 PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 STUDIES AT MARYLAND.
 THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
 YOU SAID PRETTY CLEARLY YOU ARE
 NOT A FAN OF HERMAN CAIN
 AND YOU DON'T THINK HE SHOULD
 HAVE GOTTEN THIS JOB?
 YOU DON'T SUPPORT HIM.
 I DO NOT.
 Tucker: WHATT DO YOU THINK
 GIVEN THAT
AS ABOUT H
  CUT OR SOMETHG, THE RN TAKE WHD
 AND I BELIEVE GLORIA ALLRED HAS
 DONE SOME POSITIVE THINGS IN HER
 CAREER IN TERMS OF GIVING VOICE
 TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VOICELESS BY
 DOINGCA THINGS LIKE THAT ACTUALY
 UNDERMINES THE MOVEMENT,
 UNDERMINES WHEN PEOPLE LIKE
 TARANA BURKE ARE DOING WORK TO
 GIVE VOICE TO WOMEN.Ñn
 qr:OOKS LKMAIL.
 WE WILL SHOW, WE WILL DEPICT
 YOUR GENITALS IF YOU DON'T DO
 WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DOçk
 PULL YOUR NAME AND HE CLEARLY
 CAVED UNDERSTANDABLY.
 DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY
 WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE
 BLACKMAILED LIKE THAT?
 I AGREE WITH THAT.
 THERE WERE CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS
 AGAINST HIM SO WE HAVE TO STATE
 THAT.
 Tucker: ALLEGATIONS OF
 WHAT?E
 A WOMAN SAID THAT HERMAN CAIN
 HAD DONE SOME THINGS THAT WERE
 REALLY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.AT
 OF BUT THE CASE --
 Tucker: THE ONE I READ
 ABOUT SAID IT WAS CONSENSUAL?
 THAT IS THE PROBLEM.
 WHEN YOU CONFLATE SOMETHING THAT
 IS CONSENSUAL WITH ABUSE, YOU
 .INFLATE THAT AND THAT IS THE BG
 PROBLEM HERE.■g■g■1
 WHAT THEY DID TO HERMAN CAIN IN
 THAT REGARD SAYING THAT WE WILL
 EXPOSE WHAT YOUR GENITALS LOOK
 LIKE, EITHER WAY, THAT THEY
 WOULD THAT IS TOTALLY WRONG.
 I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT
 GLORIA ALLRED IS ACTUALLY
 UNDERMINING THIS AND I CAN TELL
 YOU THAT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT
 THIS COULD BE USED AGAINST WOMEN
 IN THE FUTURE.
 Tucker: YOU THINK?
 THIS COULD BE VERY
 PROBLEMATIC.
 THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HURT
 WOMEN.
 MEN DON'T GET BODY SHAMED LIKE
 WOMEN DO.
 SOME DUDE WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH
 KAMALA HARRIS OR LIZ WARREN IS
 GOING TO SAY, KIND OF THREATEN
 HER IN THE SAME WAY AND THIS IS
 REALLY PROBLEMATIC.
 AGAIN, THE OTHER THING --
 Tucker: IT HURTS MEN WHICH
 IS EVERY BIT AS BAD AS HURTING
 WOMEN BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE
 EQUAL.
 I WILL SAY ONE OTHER THING.
 IT SEEMS UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE
 RIGHT PRICE YOU HAVE SOMEONE
 LIKE LISA BLOOM WAS IS THE
 DAUGHTER WHO SUPPORTED HARVEY
 WEINSTEIN AND WAS TALKING ABOUT
 PUTTING THINGS OUT AGAINST ROSE
 AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE
 FIGHTING FOR THE ME TOO MOVEMENT
 THAT WAS SO POSITIVE.
 SHE WAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTING
 HARVEY WEINSTEIN FOR A WHILE.
 Tucker: SHE WAS GETTING
 PAID.
 OBVIOUSLY.
 IT IS REALLY TROUBLING.
 Tucker: WHY DO WE TAKE THEM
 SERIOUSLY?
 THEY WOULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT THE
 MEDIA GIVING THEM AIRTIME AND
 THEY SAY THEY ARE ADVOCATES FOR
 WOMEN.
 THEY ARE ADVOCATES FOR
 THEMSELVES.
 THEY ARE TOTALLY DISHONEST.
 I WANT TO BELIEVE THERE IS A
 SOME SINCERITY THERE.
 Tucker: [LAUGHS]
 NEYOU ARE A GOOD MAN.
 I THINK THEY'RE MAKING A BIG
 MISTAKE IN WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
 Tucker: I DON'T THINK THEY
 CARE BUT I ADMIRE YOUR HIGH
 HOPES FOR THEM. T
 THANK YOU.
 A YEAR AGO THE CREEPY PORN
 LAWYER WAS TRAVELING ABOARD A
 PRIVATE JET THAT WAS HIS, HOW
 DID HE AFFORD THAT?
 WE KNOW THE ANSWER AND WE WILL
  YOU TONIGHT.
 PLUS WEAVE FOOTAGE SHOT BY ONE
 OF OURHO SHOWS
  SHOCKING DETAIL WHAT IS
 COUNTRY'S GREATEST CITIES.■■■■■/


 Tucker: THE CREEPY LAWYER HAS SIMPLE OLD FASHION@ TASTE.
 HE IS HAPPIEST INSIDE HIS CNN
 STUDIO BUT WHEN HE IS TRAVELING
 HE LIKES TO TRAVEL IN STYLE ON
 BOARD HIS OWN PRIVATE JET.
 HOW CAN HE AFFORD THAT?
 LUCRATIVE?
 NOT UNLESS YOUR CLIENTS
 INCLUDING AN NBA PLAYER
 EX-GIRLFRIEND.
 LEXUS GARDNER HAD HIRED
 THE LAWYER WAS AIDED IN GETTING
 A $3 MILLION SETTLEMENT BUT
 ACCORDING TO PROSECUTORS HE
 IMMEDIATELY STOLE 2 MILLION FROM
 THE SETTLEMENT TO BUY A JET.
 THE CLIENT RECEIVED LESS THAN
 EIGHT TENTHS OF THAT.
 KEEP IN MIND CNN TOLD US HE WAS
 A PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER, MAYBE
 HE IS TRYING TO GET USED TO
 TRAVELING PRIVATE.
 VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING YOU HEAR
 REPEATED ON TELEVISION, IF THEY
 REPEATED ENOUGHED PROBABLY UNTR.
 PORTERS ARE RACISTS.
 WE ARE STRONGER THE LESS WE HAVE
 IN COMMON THE OTHER PEOPLE,
 KENTUCKY HIGH SCHOOLERS,
 JOURNALISTS IN D.C. AREIN WARRIS
 FOR THE OPPRESSED.
 IT IS ALL FAKE.
 THESE ARE LIES AND THEY REPEAT
 THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
 BECAUSE THE LIES ARE POWER.■[A[[
 THEY DECIDED TO FIGHT BACK IN
 THE MOST RADICAL WAY BY TELLING
 THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE
 THINK ABOUT IT.
 A PIECE FOR "THE NEW YORK POST,"
 NO MATTER WHAT THEY TELL YOU,
 MAN CANNOT GIVE BIRTH, ONLY
 WOMEN CAN.
  US TONIGHT.
 THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.OI
 I GUESS THIS IS AN OBVIOUS POINT
 BUT HOW MUCH THE WORLD HAS
 CHANGED IN FIVE YEARS WHERE
 WOMEN GIVE BIRTH AND MEN DON'T
 IS CONSIDERED SOME RADICAL OR
 HATEFUL STATEMENT?
 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
 IT WAS A CONCERTED MOVEMENT
 IN THE TRANS-MOVEMENT WHICH HAS
 SOUGHT TO RADICALLY REDEFINE THE
 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT EACH
 REALLY IS.
 THE FACT THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE
 DIFFERENT CHROMOSOMES TILL THE
 POINT, THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND WE
 KNOW THAT.
 BECAUSE IT WAS A TINY MINORITY
 OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL DISCOMFORT IN
 THEIR BODIES, THEY HAVE SET OUT
 ON THIS TOTALITARIAN EFFORT TO
 ASK EACH OF US TO SAY, MEN CAN
 HAVE BABIES AND WOMEN CAN HAVE
 PENIS'S.
 IT IS A BIZARRE IDEA BUT WE HAVE
 GONE TO THIS POINT AND AS YOU
 SAID, IF YOU DESCRIBE FOR US --
 Tucker: THAT IS THE THING.
 I THINK MOST AMERICANS ARE HAPPY
 TO LET PEOPLE BELIEVE WHATEVER
 THEY WANT T TO BELIEVE.
 I LIVE IN MY OWN FANTASY HALF
 THE TIME, IT IS FINE.
 DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 THE IDEA THAT YOU GET TO IMPOSE
 YOUR FANTASY ON OTHER PEOPLE AND
 THEN GET THEM FIRED OR CRUSHED
 IF THEY WON'T PLAY ALONG, THAT
 IS TOTALITARIAN.
 IT IS KIND OF LIKE WINSTON AT
 THE END OF 1984 WHERE YOU HAVE
 TO SAY THAT HE IS HOLDING UP IN
 TORTURE AND HOLDING UP FIVE
 FINGERS WHEN HE IS ONLY HOLDING
 UP FOUR.
 IF YOU SAY FIVE HE WILL GIVE YOU
 PAIN.
 WE ARE NOT BEING DISPATCHED TO
 THE GULAGS BUT THE PAIN COMES IN
 PRESSURE WITH YOUR CAREER,
 PRESSURE ON YOUR PUBLIC PRESENCE
 IF YOU TRY TO SPEAK UP AGAINST
 THIS. T
 AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS IS THE
 DESIRE FOR RADICAL AUTONOMY.
 AUTONOMY TO THE LEVEL OF I CAN
 ALSO REDEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO
 BE A MAN OR WOMAN.
 WE DEFINE AUTONOMY THAT WAY, FOR
 ME TO BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE MY
 FULLEST AUTONOMY YOU HAVE TO SAY
 YOUR NAME IS SABRINA AND THAT I
 AM A WOMAN AND VICE VERSA.
 IT IS THIS IDEA OF AUTONOMY
 PUSHED FOR SUCH AN EXTENT WHERE
 IT BECOMES AUTHORITARIAN.
 Tucker: IT ELIMINATES MY
 AUTONOMY.
 I HAVY ALONG.
 BY THE WAY, I DON'T THINK WE ARE
 OVERSTATING THE EXTENT OF THE
 REPRESSION.
 YOU AND I HAVE THE ONLY TWO JOBS
 WHERE WE CAN HAVE THIS JOB IN
 PUBLIC WITHOUT GETTING FIRED.
 IF YOU WORKED AT SOME INVESTMENT
 BANK, SOME INSURANCE COMPANY,
 YOU WILL GET FIRED FOR SAYING
 THIS.
 YOU ABSOLUTELY WOULD.
 IT INCLUDES LOTS OF WOMEN, WE
 NOW HAVE A LOT OF WOMEN'S
 ATHLETICS BEING DOMINATED BY
 PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE RAW PHYSICAL
 CAPABILITIES OF MALE BODIES
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT.
 NOW THROUGH THISOT IDEA OF MEN
 BEING ABLE TO BECOME PREGNANT,
 WE ARE REFRAMING PREGNANCY.
 SOMETHING SINCE TIME AND
 MEMORIAL HAVE BEEN BOUND UP FOR
 WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A WOMAN.
 SOMETHINGOU YOU AND I COULD NEVR
 EXPERIENCE AND NOW THAT IS
 BECOMING A MALE EXPERIENCE.
 Tucker: I DON'T KNOW HOW
 THAT EMPOWERS WOMEN AND WHERE
 ARE AMERICA'S BIOLOGY TEACHERS
 WHEN YOU NEED THEM?
 I'M NOT TAKING A POLITICAL
 POSITION HERE, BUT HERE ARE THE
 FACTS.
 THERE ARE A FEW.
 AGAIN, THEY ARE DISTANT VOICES.
 THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST OF HIS
 GENERATION AT JOHNS HOPKINS IS
 THERE.
 THE IDEOLOGICAL MOVEMENT HAS SO
 MADE INROAD IN THE MEDICAL
 PROFESSION WHERE WITH
 PROFESSIONS WITH THE DOMINANT
 CONSENSUS, THE BIOLOGICAL SEX,
 THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS THAT YOU
 ARE BORN WITH IS NOT THE BASIS
 FOR DETERMINING YOUR GENDER.TH
 IT IS NOT JUST IN THE PUBLIC
 SPHERE, AMONG PSYCHIATRISTS AND
 SO FORTH.
 THIS HAS BECOME THE NORM AND IT
 IS YOUR POWER POLITICS.
 Tucker: ONLY RICH COUNTRIES
 CAN AFFORD TO BE THIS DECADENT.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
 OVERWHELMINGLY SPEAKING OF KIDS,
 AMERICANS WANT TO HAVE THEM.
 THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN
 THAN THEY HAVE AND THIS WAS ONE
 AO CORE PROBLEMS IN OUR
 SOCIETY STEAD OF FIXING
 THIS POLITICIANS TELL US WE
 SHOULD BRING IN NEW PEOPLE IN
 ORDER TO KEEP OUR POPULATION
 STABLE.
 ELIZABETH WARREN SAID SHE WOULD
 BE GIVING A $50,000 STUDENT LOAN
 AMNESTY TO ALL COLLEGE GRADS.
 HERE'S THEDAO PROPOSAL, WHY NOT
 L FORGIVE ALL THE LOANS OFHE
 AMERICANS WHO GET MARRIED AND
 HAVE KIDS?
 IT MIGHT HELP.
 WHY IS THAT CRAZY?
 THE PRESIDENT OF CONCERNED WOMEN
 OF AMERICA.
 THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
 MOST AMERICANS WANT TO HAVE MORE
 CHILDREN THAN THEY CAN AFFORD.
 WHY IS THIS NOT THE BASIC
 EYPROMISE EVERY POLITICIAN RUNNG
 FOR EVERY OFFICE IS MAKING?
 IF ELECTED I WILL HELP YOU HAVE
 AS MANY KIDS AS YOU WANT.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS
 OUT ECONOMICALLY BUT WE HAVE TOI
 ADDRESS THIS.
 IT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR ELDERLY,
 SOCIAL SECURITY AND NEW MARKETS
 FORR CORPORATIONS.
 IF WE HAVE LESS CHILDREN, IF THE
 POPULATION CONTINUES TO DECLINE,
 WE ARE NOT AT REPLACEMENT RATE.
 THAT IS 2.1 AT 1.7.
 WE WILL NOT RETIRE NEARLY AS
 SOON AND WE WILL HAVE TO WORK
 HARDER.
 AMERICAN WOMEN SAY THE VAST
 MAJORITY WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN
 AND WOMEN WITH MINOR CHILDREN,
 60% SAY THEY WANT TO SPEND MORE
 TIME WITH THEM.
 IF THEY HAD THEIR IDEAL
 SITUATION, 60% WOULD ONLY WORKTH
 PART TIME.
 19% WOULD STAY AT HOME WITH
 THEIR KIDS.
 Tucker: WHY WOULDN'T A
 POLITICAL PARTY SAY HERE IS A
 HUGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WANT
 SOMETHING DEEPLY, WHY DON'T WE
 HELP THEM PROVIDE IT?
 THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEEDS TO
 STEP UP AND LEAD ON THIS.
 WE ARE TRYING P TO DO MORE,
 SOMEONE WORKED WITH IVANKA TRUMP
 TO WORK ON THAT.
 TEXT CREDIT FROM $1,000 TO

 IT SHOULD BE MORE.
 WE ARE TALKING THROUGH POLICIES
 NOW THAT WOULD ALLOW WOMAN TO
 DIP INTO THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY
 AHEAD OF TIME WHILE THEY ARE AT
 THEIR LITTLE BABIES AND THENTH
 JUST DELAY GETTING IT LATER OR
 LESS ON THE BACK END.
 WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK THROUGH
 THIS.
 WE NEED TO TALK TO CORPORATIONS.
 WE WANT MORE T POSSIBILITY ASAL
 WOMEN.
 Tucker: SHOULD WE BE
 SHOOTING FOR LIKE SIX YEARS?
 WE NEED TO FIND PROPOSALS
 THAT GIVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO
 WOMANNG AND THAT IS A BROADER
 CONVERSATION INCLUDING CORPORATE
 AMERICA AND REMOVING ALL THE
 MANY REGULATIONS THAT STOP US■■
 ■■FROM HAVING THIS INDUSTRY.
 BECAUSE OF HIGH TAXES ON THE
 WORLD WE LIVE IN WE ARE A TWO
 INCOME FAMILY IS THE NORM IN
 MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY NEED
 THAT EXTRA INCOME.
 MANY WOMEN WANT TO WORK AT SOME
 LEVEL.
 LET'S HELP THEM BE FLEXIBLE AND
 LET'S THINK OF POLICIES THAT
 GIVE THEM THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF
 TIME THAT THEY WANT TO BE AT
 HOME WITH THEIR KIDS OR DADLE
 WANTS TO BE AT HOME WITH THE
 KIDS.
 Tucker: I DON'T KNOW WHY IT
 NEVER OCCURS TO ANYONE.
 THERE ARE LECTURES ON THE
 SOCIALISM OR YOU CAN BE AN
 ENTREPRENEUR, HOW ABOUT I WANT
 TO RAISE MY KIDS?
 WHY IS THD?
 I TALK TO THEM AND ALL THE
 TIME AND THEY SAY I AM JUST A
 MOM.
 YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THAT.
 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS JUST A
 MOM.
 THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB
 AND THE HARDEST JOB I'VE HAD.
 Tucker: THERE ARE NINE
 UNHAPPY PEOPLE WHO WRITE OUR
 SOCIAL POLICY.
 NO MORE LISTENING TO THEM.
 PSALMS
 KIDS ARE GIFT FROM THE LORD.D.
 Tucker: FACEBOOK KNOWS MORE
 ABOUT YOU THAN YOUR FRIENDS
 KNOW, YOUR PARENTS KNOW,
 PROBABLY THAT YOU KNOW FROM
 YOURSELF.
 THEY WANT TO KNOW MORE AND THEY
 ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE AMERICA
 TO PUT CAMERAS INSIDE THEIR OWN
 HOMES.
 EVEN THEIR BEDROOMS, IS THAT A

 GOOD IDEA? WE WILL TELL YOU AFTER THE
 BREAK.

 T
 Tucker: FACEBOOK IS THE
 WORLD'S MOST POPULAR
 SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK.
 YOU MIGHT THINK THE WORLD'S
 BILLION USERS ARE ITS CUSTOMERS
 BUT THEY ARE NOT.
 THEY ON THEIR PERSONAL
 INFORMATION ARE THE PRODUCT THAT
 FACEBOOK SELLS TO ITS
 ADVERTISEMENTS.
 THAT IS THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT.U
 IN A CONFERENCE, THEY WANT TO BE
 CEO OF FACEBOOK HAS MORE DATA
 ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO
 ONLINE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE
 WORLD.
 HE MAY HAVE THE MOST INFORMATION
 BUT HE WANTS MORE DATA.
 FACEBOOK IS NOW ACCUSING SLICK
 ADVERTISEMENTS TO CONVINCE YOU
 TO PUT NEW MORE CAMERAS INSIDE
 YOUR OWN HOME.
 WATCH.
 HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.
 IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 YOU HANG OUT WITH THE MOMS OF
 OTHER FAMOUS PEOPLE?
 SERENA'S MOM, SNOOP DOGG'S MOM,
 AM I IN TROUBLE?
 THERE IS NOTHING WRONG.
 COME ON OVER HERE AND LET US
 LOOK AT YOU.
 Tucker: THE FORMER ADVISOR
 TO MARK ZUCKERBERG, AND AUTHOR

 JOINS US TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
 THE LOOKS FROM THAT AT THAT
 ILLOGICAL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE
 ALLOWING MARK ZUCKERBERG TO PUT
 SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS INSIDE
 THEIR HOMES.PL
 SHOULD I DO THE SAME?
 I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT, I
 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE
 WATCHING THAT SHOW.
 HE MADE THE POINT CORRECTLY
 BEFORE.
 FACEBOOK IS THE BUSINESS OF
 SURVEILLANCE.
 THEY GATHER ALL THE DATA THEY
 CAN, NOT JUST THE STUFF THEY PUT
 INTO THE SYSTEM BUT THEY TRACK
 US.
 THEY BUY DATA FROM BANKS AND
 CREDITSO CARD PROCESSORS AND THY
 BUY IT FROM HEALTH AND WELLNESS
 APPLICATIONS AND THEY BUY IT
  OUR CELLULAR CARRIERS TO
 TELL WHERE WE ARE.
 THEY BUY IT ALL SO SO THEY CAN
 CREATE A DATA AVATAR FOR US AND
 THAT AS YOU SAY, THAT MAKES US
 NOT EVEN THE PRODUCT, THE FUEL
 FOR THEIR BUSINESS MODEL.
 Tucker: THAT SEEMS RIGHT.EI
 WHY IS IT THAT THERE IS NO
 SKEPTICISM IN THE MEDIA ABOUT
 THIS OR ANY OF THE OTHER --
 KARA SWISHER WHO COVERS
 TECHNOLOGY FOR
 "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BASICALLY
 WRITES PRESS RELEASES.
 WHY DOES NOBODY PUSH BACK EVER?
 TO BE CLEAR THERE IS THE
 BEGINNING OF A CHANGE BUT I
 THINK YOU ARE RIGHT.
 THERE IS A DEFAULT MECHANISM TO
 TRUST TECH.
 TECHNOLOGY WAS SOMETHING THAT
 MADE OUR LIVES BETTER FOR 50
 YEARS AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH
 FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT
 AND AMAZON IS THEY HAVE TAKEN
 ADVANTAGE OF TRUST AND GOODWILL
 AND THEY ARE STARTING TO EXPLOIT
 THAT IN A WAY THAT REALLY TAKES
 AWAY OUR CHOICE.
 THE BUSINESS MODEL THEY HAVE
 BUILT IS REALLY, THEY ARE TRYING
 TO USE DATA TO TAKE AWAY
 UNCERTAINTY FOR ADVERTISERS, THE
 PROBLEM ISN'T DOING SO THEY ARE
 TAKING AWAY THE CHOICES FOR US
 AS THE CONSUMER.
 CHOICE IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.
 I THINK THERE IS A PHILOSOPHICAL
 DEBATE THAT HAS TO HAPPEN AND AS
 YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN AN
 IMPORTANT PART OF, I'M TRYING TO
 LEAD THIS DEBATE.
 THERE ARE TWO POINTS, YOU WANT
 TO MAKE THE WORLD MORE EFFICIENT
 AND I WANT TO HAVE MORE LIBERTY
 AND MORE CHOICES.
 I WANT TO SEE WHICH SIDE WINS.
 Tucker: IN THIS CASE, THIS
 AMAZON PRODUCT, IT PIVOTS AROUN■
 THE ROOM FOLLOWING YOU AND
 SHOOTING FOOTAGE OF WHAT IS
 HAPPENING INSIDE YOUR HOME, YOUR
 MOST PRIVATE SPACES.PE
 THAT IS THE CREEPIEST THING.
 WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DAT
 HOW DO WE KNOW THAT IS SECURE
 AND WILL BE USED AGAINST US?
 THERE IS NO REASON WE SHOULD
 BE TRUSTING AND THE SAME THING
 IS TRUE FOR ALEXA AND GOOGLE
 HOME AND THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT
 EITHER LISTEN TO YOU OR FILM IN
 YOUR HOME.
 IT IS CRAZY.
 THE NOTION WE WOULD LET ONE OF
 THESE THINGS INTO OUR KITCHEN
 MUCH LESS OUR OFFICE OR OUR
 BEDROOM.
 RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO RULES,
 ALL WE HAVE IS THE COMPANIES
 WORD.■■
 OF COURSE THESE THINGS ARE
 VULNERABLE TO HACKING AND THE
 PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE ARE
 VULNERABLE TO ALL KINDS OF
 EXPLOITATION.
 MY VIEW IS THAT WE SHOULD STOP
 ALL OF THESE THINGS AND PUSH
 BACK REALLY HARD.
 I WANT TO GO --
 I'M SAYING TO EVERY SINGLE
 PERSON WHO IS RUNNING
 OFFICE, W■■ I'M ON YOUR
 AIR, WE SHOULD ASK THE SIMPLE
 QUESTION, WHY IS IT LEGAL FOR
 THERE TO BE A THIRD PARTY MARKET
 WITH OUR PERSONAL DATA, WITHOUT
 OUR INVOLVEMENT?
 WHY SHOULD THEY TRADE OUR
 FINANCIAL DATA, OR HEALTH DATA?
 WHY SHOULD GOOGLE BE ALLOWED TO
 SCAN OUR EMAILS FOR THEIR
 BENEFIT?
 IT IS NUTS.
 IF THEY WERE THE POSTAL SERVICE
 THEY WOULD GET ARRESTED.
 I THINK THERE HAS BEEN NO RULES
 FOR TOO LONG AND IT'S TIME TO
 HAVE SOME RULES.
 Tucker: THE REAL THREAT IS
 VLADIMIR PUTIN AND RUSSIA!
 YOU MAKES SOME SOLID POINTS.
 GREAT TO SEE YOU.
 IT IS EARTH DAY AND INSTEAD OF
 CUTTING HIS OWN CARBON
 FOOTPRINT, HE HAS A NEW PLAN.
 STOP GLASS AND STEEL BUILDINGS?
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN YOU LIVE
 IN A COUNTRY THAT CAN TELL YOU
 WHAT KIND OF BUILDINGS TO BUILD?
 WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE STREETS
 OF LOS ANGELES.
 WHEN WE COME BACK.

    H/H■■es■7
 Tucker: THE FOOTAGE ON YOUR
 SCREPICTURE RIGHT THERE,
 WAY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS
 LAST WEEK.
 WE WERE IN CALIFORNIA ALL WEEK
 IN LOS ANGELES, SUPPOSEDLY ONE
 OF THE RICHEST CITIES IN THE
 WORLD AND IN SOME WAYS IT IS.
 BUT THE VIDEO YOU ARE WATCHING
 SHOWS SOMETHING ELSE.
 CALIFORNIANS MEANDERING POOR,
 TRASH FILLED STREETS.
 RIGHT IN DOWNTOWN, HOMELESS
 ENCAMPMENTS ON THE SIDEWALKS AND
 BLANKETING DOWNTOWN L.A.
 THE FOOTAGE STARTS AT FIFTH
 STREET AND SAN PEDRO AND GOES
 WEST.
 BLOCK AFTER BLOCK, TENT AFTER
 TENT.
 THIS IS HOW THE POOR SPENT
 EASTER SUNDAY IN CALIFORNIA.
 THEY WEREN'T CLUSTERED ON ONE
 SINGLE ROAD, IT WASN'T LIKE
 SKID ROW.
 IT WAS LIKE MANY SKID ROWS.
 IT CONTINUED.
 IT IS AMERICA'S SECOND LARGEST
 CITY.
 THE ENCAMPMENTS BEGAN JUST TWO
 BLOCKS AWAY FROM LITTLE TOKYO,
 ONE OF L.A'S MAJOR TOURIST
 DESTINATIONS.W
 YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING, WITH SO
 MANY PEOPLE PRICED OUT OF LOCAL
 HOUSING, FEW PEOPLE ARE
 LITERALLY LIVING IN RVs, MILES
 OF RVs PARKED ALONG THE
 STREET.
 THEY ARE IN TENTS, WHY WOULDN'T
 LOCAL LEADERS WANT TO SLOW OR
 STOP THE FLOW OF NEW ARRIVALS TO
 GET PRICES UNDER CONTROL?
 TO OPEN UP NEW HOUSING?
 THEY ARE DOING THE OPPOSITE.
 L.A. IS A SANCTUARY CITY AND AS
 SANCTUARY STATE.
 THEY WILL DENOUNCE OUR BORDERS
 AN ATROCITY AND THAT IS AN
 ABOMINATION.
 THE POOR IN CALIFORNIA ARE AN
 AFTERTHOUGHT, ONE OF THE REASONS
 Y THEY ARE MULTIPLYING.
 THAT'S WHYGOVERNOR NEWSOM
 TRIED TO FIGHT IT, HE FLEW TO
 ANOTHER COUNTRY TO DO IT WITH
 EL SALVADOR.
 THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WANT NO
 LIMITS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING
 HERE CAN'T EVEN HOW'S THE PEOPLE
 WHO LIVE HERE.
 <u><i> MAY</i></u>
 KNOW, THAT IS A GOOD THING FOROR THE RECORD.
 NEW YORK MAYOR de BLASIO SIZE
 UNITED STATES AND ENJOY TAKING
 HIS SUV CONVOY ALL OVER THE
 CITY, OR HER TAKING A HELICOPTER
 O THE GYM.
 DON'T WORRY, HE3O3O3O3O PLAN FOR
 ABSOLVING HIS OLTRESTRICT THE B.
 HE WANTS TO PASS THE GREEN NEW
 DEAL WHICH HE SAYS WILL BAN THE
 ICONIC SKYSCRAPERS, WATCH THIS.
 WE WILL BAN THE CLASSIC
 GLASS AND STEAL SKYSCRAPERS
 WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY
 INEFFICIENT.
 Tucker: MARK STEYN JOINS
 US.
 I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS.
 I'M GOING TO GET IT RIGHT DOWN
 ON THE FLOOR
 I THINK ALL OF THE CREEPS WHO
 DESTROYED THE WORLD'S LANDSCAPE
 WITH WORKER HOUSING AND THE T
 STEEL, THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
 I AM AGAINST STEAL AND GLASS BUT
 I DON'T THINK THAT HE WANTS TO
 REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING BETTER
 AND88IS MY SUSPICION.
 I'M WITH YOU.
 I AM OPPOSED TO THAT.
 ON AESTHETIC GROUNDS.
 I AM HORRIFIED AT THE TALK THAT
 THEY MIGHT BE I.M. PEI-ING UP
 THE NEW 88CATHED
 PARIS.S.
 I AM WITH YOU.
 I'M WITH YOU ON AESTHETIC
 GROUNDS BUT I DON'T WANT TO BAN
 IT ON CLIMATE GROUNDS, WHICHES I
 THINK IS JUST RIDICULOUS, EVEN
 ON EARTH DAY.
 AFTER WHAT YOU'VE JUST SHOWED
 ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES,SA
 PERFECT REMINDER THAT CLIMATE
 CHANGE IS ESSENTIALLY A BOUTIQUE
 ISSUE.
 IT IS ALMOST LIKE AN ACCESSORY
 FOR WESTERN LIBERAL POLITICIANS
 TO FLAUNT HOW MUCH THEY CARE
 WHILE ACTUALLY DOING NOTHING
 ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE
 JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE
 RESPONSIBLE.
 Tucker: IT COULDN'T REALLYFO
 BE CLEARER, COULD IT?
 WHY WOULDN'T YOU TAKE EARTH DAY
 WHICH AT LEAST THEORETICALLY I
 SUPPORT.
 I LOVE THE OUTDOORS.x
 I W FISHING THIS MORNING.WH
 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE
 OUTSIDE I THINK.
 WHY WOULDN'T YOU TAKE THIS
 OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAN UP THE
 ACTUAL EARTH?
 STARTING HOW ABOUT AT CITY HALL?
 WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT?
 YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT ALL
 WRONG.
 EARTH DAY IS ABOUT FLYING A
 POLITICIAN IN TO DO THE LAST BIT
 OF TREE PLANTING THAT SEVERAL OF
 HIS STAFF AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL
 ACTIVIST HAVE BEEN SPENDING THE
 WHOLE DAY WORKING ON.
 I LIVE IN A TOWN IN
 NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT IS 95%
 TREE COVERED.
 WE HAVE THE CLIMATE CHANGE
 FEVER.
 WE NEED TO GET IT BACK TO 98% OR
 THE PLANET WILL DIE.
 I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT 3% WENT
 I THINK THEY WERE ALL USED TO
 PRINT TRANSCRIPTS OF THE MOTHER
 REPORT
 I THINK THEY WERE ALL USED TO PRINT TRANSCRIPTS OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 THAT IS WHAT EARTH DAY IS ABOUT.
 DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE FILTH
 IN YOUR OWN CITY.
 IT GOES BACK TO THE WAY
 LABOR DAY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED.
 RALABOR DAY WAS PARTLY, IN ITS
 ORIGINS, ABOUT THE ORDER AND
 CLEANLINESS THAT MAN HAS IMPOSED
 ON A WILD ENVIRONMENT AND AS YOU
 SEE ON THE STREETS OF
 LOS ANGELES, EVEN THAT HAS BEEN
 RETURNED TO A PRIMITIVE AND
 BRUTISH STATE.
 Tucker: WHAT DO YOU THINK
 THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED AMERICA'S

 CONSERVATION MOVEMENT, JOHN MUIR FOR EXAMPLE OR TEDDY ROOSEVELT,
 WHO PROTECTED MILLIONS OF ACRES,
 WHAT WOULD THEY MAKE OF BILL
 de BLASIO'S VARIETY OF
 ENVIRONMENTALISM WHERE YOU NEVER
 GO OUTSIDE?
 I THINK THAT IS WHERE THE
 WHOLE BIT ABOUT HIM TRAVELING BT
 SUV AND EVERYTHING COMES IN.
 I THINK THEY WOULD SEE IT AS A
 CLASS THING.
 IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WE HAVE
 SEEN IN THE LAST 150 YEARS HAS
 BEEN THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF
 MOBILITY.
 THE THINGS YOU HAD TO BE A
 COND SON OF A GRAND DUKE TO
 DO, LIKE TRAVEL WILDLY, ARE NOW
 AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.
 LEONARDO DiCAPRIO AND AL GORE
 THINK, NO, IT IS JUST THOSE GUYS
 WHO NEED THE SUVs AND THE
 PRIVATE PLANES.
 THE REST OF US SHOULD BE
 STANDING OUTSIDE WAITING FOR A
 BUS EVERY 40 MINUTES ON A COLD
 WINTER'S MORNING AND INSTEAD OF
 USING A WASHER AND DRYER, WE
 SHOULD BE BEATING OUR CLOTHES
 DOWN BY THE RIVER ON THE ROCKS.
 IT IS THE MOST EXPLICITDO
 EXPRESSION OF THE NEW CLASS
 POLITICS THAT MODERN-DAY
 LIBERALISM IS IMPOSING ON US.
 Tucker: IT IS FASCINATING.x
 THAT IS WHY HE HAS HIKED THE
 TOLLS TO COME INTO NEW YORK CITY
 BECAUSE THE IDEA IS IF YOU DON'T
 ALREADY LIVE IN MANHATTAN, WHAT
 ARE YOU DOING HERE?
  IS SNOBBE
 HE SAYS HE HAS TO GO TO HIS
 GYM IN BROOKLYN.
 TO COMMUNE WITH THE PEOPLE SO
 HE'S NOT IN THE■ BIBLE.
 HE IS DRIVEN THERE IN AN SUV BY
 GUYS WITH REFLECTOR SHADES AND
 TELEPHONE CORDS AND IF ANY
 MEMBER OF THE MASSES TRIED TO
 GET NEAR HIM DURING HIS PHOTO OP
 AT THE GYM THEY WOULD BE TAKEN
 OUT BY THE S.W.A.T. TEAM.
 IT IS THIS PHONY POSER COMMUTING
 WITH THE PEOPLE.
 AND PHONY POSER
 ENVIRONMENTALISM, TOO.
 Tucker: THERE IS AN AWFUL
 LOT OF THAT.
 MARK STEYN, NOTHING PHONY ABOUT
 MARK STEYN.
 GREAT TO SEE YOU.
 GREAT TO SEEWE YOU.
 Tucker: WE ARE OUT OF TIME
 BUT WE WILL BE BACK AND THAT IS
 OURT PROMISE TO YOU.
 TOMORROW NIGHT AT 8:00 P.M.
 THE SHOW THAT IS THE
