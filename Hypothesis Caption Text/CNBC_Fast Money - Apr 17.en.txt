 FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING THAT
 ARE GETTING MARRIED IN THE FALL
 AND A LOT OF THEM WILL THINK TO
 PLAY THAT SONG
 NOBODY WOULD THINK TO PLAY
 THIS SONG.
 THIS SIS SO OLD, AND WE ARE
 FAMILY, THE SISTER SLEDGE SONG
 I ENCOURAGE YOU FOLKS, IF YOU'RE
 THINKING ABOUT IT, DON'T DO IT
 THE MORE YOU KNOW
 WELCOME, DAN.
 WHAT WAS THE QUESTION
 NO, I KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION
 IS
 CAN THE TECH HEAVY WEIGHTS GO
 UP
 FACEBOOK SCARES ME, BUT THERE
 ARE NAMES THAT MAKE SOME SENSE
 AND WE HEADED SIMILARLY TO THE
 SHOW ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF
 TWO MONTHS AGO AND I SAID THERE
 WAS ANOTHER RADAR STOCK IN TECH
 THAT PEOPLE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT
 THAT WAS $230 RIGHT BEFORE
 PRESIDENT TRUMP STARTED THESE
 TEARIVES AND IT TRADED DOWN 130
 AND IT TRADED TO THE UPSIDE AND
 IT WAS LAM RESEARCH AND THEY
 REPORTED AND 5G IS ALL THE RAGE
 AND AT 13 TIMES FORWARD EARNINGS
 IT'S A REASONABLE VALUATION.
 SO IF YOU'RE LOOK FOR EXAMPLE A
 PLACE THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
 TALK ABOUT IT'S LRCX
 IS IT TROUBLING THAT SOME OF
 THESE LARGEST CAP COMPANIES IN
 THE NASDAQ 100 AREN'T QUITE
 THERE YET?
 I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S
 TROUBLING IN A SENSE
 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THE LAST
 TIME I WAS ON THE SHOW
 TECH IS THE MOST CYCLICAL SECTOR
 THAT'S OUT THERE AND ON A LOT OF
 DIFFERENT METRICS AND THE FACT
 THAT SOME OF THESE STOCKS
 HAVEN'T DONE WELL, SOME OF THESE
 STOCKS ARE CYCLICAL AND YOU LOOK
 AT THIS QUARTER'S EARNINGS AND
 THE TECH EARNINGS WILL BE DOWN
 10% AND THAT'S WHAT'S BAKED INTO
 CONSENSUS RIGHT NOW.
 PEOPLE FORGET THAT THESE ARE
 CYCLICAL STOCKS AND THE PROFIT
 CYCLE IS SLOWING RIGHT NOW
 SO I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO
 RECOGNIZE THAT AND A LOT OF
 THESE STOCKS THAT YOU MENTION
 ARE THE ONES THAT YOU'RE SEEING
 THE HIT AND APPLE IS A GREAT
 EXAM EXAMPLE OF THAT
 THE FACT THAT THE
 SEMICONDUCTOR INDEX DID TO ME
 WHAT'S A BLOW-UP TOP AND IF YOU
 GET SLOW ARE EARNINGS AND A
 VERTICAL TOP MARKET AND THEY'VE
 BEEN THE LEADERS AND REMEMBER,
 THEY TOPPED OUT AND STARTED
 GOING LORE BEFORE THE OCTOBER
 AND NOVEMBER SOON.
 WE PLAYED CELEBRATION AT THE
 TOP OF THE SHOW WHICH IS
 SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING VERY
 GOOD
 NO, NO.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT GOOD
 I THINK CASH WILL STAY DOWN ON
 APPLE, NOT THAT, TO ME
 SEMICONDUCTOR NAME WILL BE MUCH
 MORE CYCLICAL THAN A FANG-TYPE
 NAME AND THE EUPHORIA THERE, I
 DON'T KNOW THAT THE FAJS ARE TOO
 CHEAP.
 THE ONES I DO OWN I THINK ARE
 CHEAP AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE WAY
 IT IS.
 ALPHABET, FACEBOOK, THOSE
 REPRESENT REAL VALUE AND SO I'M
 LONG THOSE AND I HOPE THAT THEY
 GO UP AND THE SEMIS DON'T
 COLLAPSE -NOT COLLAPSE, BUT
 DON'T COME IN A LOT AND THAT'S
 WHY I THINK THE VALUE IS
 I WOULDN'T BE CHASING SEMIS
 HERE.
 TO SORT OF KEY OFF WHAT THESE
 GUYS ARE SAYING DO YOU THEN WANT
 TO MOVE INTO THE MORE VALUE AREA
 OF THE CYCLICAL SECTORS AT THIS
 POINT?
 FOR EXAMPLE, THE BANKS.
 THE BANKS.
 FOR EXAMPLE --
 THE MOST VALUABLE IN THE MOST
 CYCLICAL SECTOR, RIGHT
 AND OBVIOUSLY THE BANKS HAVE HAD
 A NICE RUN AND I'M SURPRISED BY
 HOW WELL THEY TRADED AND I
 LOOKED AT THAT TIME AND MAYBE IT
 MAKES SENSE AND YOU LOOK AT
 GOLDMAN SACHS HOVERING AROUND
 208 AND THAT'S THE BOOK VALUE OF
 THE STOCK WHEN THEY REPORTED A
 COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
 BANKS THAT ARE TRADING BOOK
 VALUE.
 YEAH, YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT MAKES
 SENSE AND J.P. MORGAN WHICH IS
 TRADING TWO TIMES PRICE TO
 TANGIBLE BOOK WHICH IS A
 DIFFERENT CONVERSATION AND YOU
 HAVE TO WONDER ARE THEY AHEAD OF
 THEMSELVES AND TO PUSH BACK ON
 TECH A LITTLE BIT.
 FACEBOOK HAS BEEN IMPERVIOUS TO
 EVERY BIT OF BAD NEWS THAT'S
 COME ACROSS THE HELM AND THERE'S
 BEEN A LOT OF IT OVER THE LAST
 COUPLE OF MONTHS
 YOU HAVE TO WONDER AT A CERTAIN
 POINT GIVEN THE RUN IS THE BAD
 NEWS GOING COVER UP AND THE ONLY
 THING THAT SAVED IT, AND IF THAT
 WERE EVER TO CHANGE, LOOK OUT
 BELOW ON FACEBOOK.
 MY OPINION
 THE PROCTER & GAMBLE CEO SAID
 HE WAS RE-EXAMINING THE AD SPEND
 BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE PRESS
 AROUND IT.
 WE'RE NOT TOO LONG AWAY FROM
 FACEBOOK'S EARNINGS.
 WE'RE NOT
 TO ME, FACEBOOK HAS
 IDIOSYNCRATIC ISSUES AND IT IS
 UNCLEAR IF THAT'S GOING TO WORK.
 NOT ONLY THAT, THEY'RE TRYING TO
 HAVE THIS PRIVACY FIRST AND
 AGAIN, WHEN YOU'RE TIEING TO DO
 THAT, AND I DON'T WANT TO CALL
 IT A TURNAROUND STORY, BUT IT
 REMINDS ME VERY MUCH OF A
 TURNAROUND STORY AND I DON'T
 THINK IT WILL TRADE AS MUCH WITH
 THE MARKET AND IT MAY BE A GOOD
 VALUE, BUT IF I LOOK AT THE
 FANGS IN THEM AND TO ME APPLE IS
 THE ONE THAT LOOKS THE BEST IF
 YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUY SOMETHING
 AND I THINK THAT'S MORE
 DEFENSIVE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
 BECAUSE OF THEIR RELATIVELY
 STEADY EARNINGS STREAK
 SO, DAN, IS THIS ALL A CUE
 FOR INVESTORS TO SAY I WANT TO
 BE IN THE CYCLICAL AREAS OF THE
 MARKET, BUT I WANT TO BE IN
 THOSE THAT ARE MORE VALUE
 ORIENTED AT THIS POINT
 I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE
 WHOLE THESIS ALTOGETHER.
 OKAY.
 WHEN THE PROFIT CYCLE IS SLOWING
 YOU DON'T WANT TO OWN CYCLICALS
 BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS
 THAT WILL HAVE THE WORST
 EARNINGS TRENDS AND IT DOESN'T
 MATTER IF THEY'RE VALUE
 CYCLICALS AND HIGH GROWTH
 CYCLICALS.
 YOU WANT TO TONE DOWN YOUR
 OPTIMISM ON THE WHOLE SPACE.
 SO THE RECENT BID IN BANK
 STOCKS, FOR INSTANCE
 BAD NEWS THERE
 I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS
 YEAR AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
 LAST TIME IS THAT EVERYBODY IS
 GETTING CALLED OUT ON THIS
 WHAT'S BEEN GOING THIS YEAR
 TRADE, RIGHT
 TECH IS ONE OF THE BEST
 PERFORMING SECTORS AND ALL OF
 THE CYCLICALS ARE DOING WELL AND
 IT'S A REVERSAL OF WHAT HAPPENED
 LAST YEAR.
 SO PEOPLE ARE ASSUMING THAT
 WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS YEAR IS
 THIS, TODAY'S FUNDAMENTALS AND
 IT'S ABOUT FOURTH QUARTER
 FUNDAMENTALS AND REVERSING THAT.
 IF YOU TAKE THAT OUT OF IT THE
 CYCLICALS HAVEN'T DONE THAT
 WELL
 THE CYCLICALS HAVE DONE THAT
 BELL AND THE DEFENSIVE STUFF,
 AND IT WILL BE THE STUFF THAT
 MATTERS MORE.
 I THINK THE BANKS ARE A PROXY
 FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY, ECONOMY,
 LET'S JUST SAY, THEY'VEL SHOWN
 THEY CAN BE PROFITABLE AND BE
 THEY DON'T EVERYBODY IT P-E, AND
 THAT'S A POSITIVE TO ME.
 LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE AN
 INDUSTRIAL OR SICK NICKAL LIKE A
 URI WHICH I EARN
 BIG EARNINGS OUT TONIGHT AND
 THEY'RE JUST REAFFIRMING AND THE
 STOCK'S UP A LOT AND PEOPLE ARE
 NERVOUS THAT THE CALL WAS
 SLOWING AND IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT
 THEY'RE TELLING YOU IS THEY'RE
 NOT SEEING THAT.
 THEY'RE SEEING STRENGTH OUT
 THERE AND SO I THINK THAT AS
 LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE GOOD,
 ECONOMIC DATA OR GOOD EARNINGS,
 I THINK THE MARKET DOES HAVE
 MORE TO RUN.
 HOWEVER, I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
 WITH THE VIX IN HERE
 I HAVE TO BUY MORE PUTS.
 SO THE POINT IS WE HAVE GOOD
 ECONOMIC NEWS.
 THAT'S WHAT CONCERNED ME TODAY
 IS WE HAD GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS
 FROM CHINA
 IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT WE'D
 HAVE A TRADE DEAL SIGNED BY THE
 END OF MAY I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
 THE DOW WAS UP 300 POINTS AND A
 THESE LEVELS IT DOESN'T SEEM
 LIKE THE DRIVERS WHO HAVE DRIVEN
 THIS UP AND LOW INTEREST RATES
 BY THE FED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
 A TRADE DEAL AND IMPROVING
 ECONOMY, ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN
 PRICED IN.
 WE NEED THIS NEW PIECE OF
 INFORMATION THAT WILL MOVE THE
 MARKET AND MY CONCERN IS WITH
 THIS RALLY THAT NEW PIECE OF
 INFORMATION MOVES THE MARKET
 LOWER AND LOOK AT HOW THE VIX
 TRADED TODAY
 IT CLOSED NEAR THE HIGHS OF THE
 DAY.
 I MEAN, THE QUESTION IS WITH
 ALL THIS SAID COULD A CHINA
 TRADE DEAL BE A SELL THE NEWS,
 VENT WITH WHERE WE ARE IN THE
 CYCLE AND WITH VALUATION AND THE
 LACK OF REACTION IN THE MARKS
 AND IT COULD JUST BE THAT ALL OF
 THESE THINK'S HEAD LINES THAT
 HAS COME OUT
 EVERY DAY THERE IS A DIM
 INUSHING TRADE LINE, AND STEVE
 MNUCHIN SAYS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
 BEATED ABOUT IT AND HE HADN'T
 MOVED IT AT ALL, AND WE'RE 75%
 FROM THE S&P AND THE MARKET
 CONTINUES TO LEVITATE HERE IN MY
 OPINION BECAUSE THE CENTRAL BANK
 AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE DID A
 TOTALLY ABOUT FACE TWO OR THREE
 MONTHS AGO AND THAT TO ME IS THE
 BIG DRIVER AND THE HOPE OF A
 CHINA TRADE DEAL
 I'LL SAY THIS, THE CHINESE MARK
 HAS COME RAKING BACK.
 AND THE DATA HAS COME RAGING
 BACK
 AGAIN, MY OPINION AND WHY WOULD
 THE CHINESE BE IN SUCH A SUHURR
 WITH THE UNITED STATES RIGHT
 NOW?
 IF THEY DON'T THE MARKET
 WOULD GO DOWN A LOT.
 THIS IS A LONGER TERM THING,
 RIGHT?
 THEY CAN'T TIME THE MARKET WHEN
 YOU DO IT.
 SINCE THERE ARE BANKS LENDING
 THE EQUIVALENT OF THE GDP OF
 SWITZERLAND, YEAR TO DATE AND
 THINGS LIKE THAT HELP.
 ALSO WE HAVE ANOTHER FIGHT ON
 OUR HANDS WITH EUROPE,
 POTENTIALLY AND I DON'T THINK IT
 WILL STOP THERE.
 YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT FIGHTS
 WITH DEAD GUYS AND THEY'LL
 CERTAINLY FIGHT WITH ANYBODY
 ELSE IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S A
 BIG RISK TO THE MARKET
 I THINK THE ONE THING THAT
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SHOULD YOU
 BUY THE S&P HERE
 SHOULD YOU BUY CYCLICALS
 WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BUY CHOIN
 A RIGHT?
 IF THE DATA IS IMPROVING IN
 CHINA THE DATA IS GETTING WORSE,
 THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS DON'T TALK
 ABOUT BUYING U.S. CYCLICALS AND
 I THINK THERE'S MORE ROOM TO
 RUN.
 OR ONE SEPARATE MOVE.
 WOULD YOU BUY EUROPE
 NO.
 SO YOU CAN BUY THE SECOND
 DERIVATIVE PLAY AND WHY BUY THE
 SECOND DERIVATIVE PLAY WHEN
 THERE'S PLENTY OF UPSIDE THERE
 EUROPE'S RUN A BIT TOO,
 RIGHT?
 TO ME CHINA HAS THE MORE UPSIDE
 AND YOU WANT TO SEE COPPER HAD A
 GREAT BREAKOUT AND THAT TENDS TO
 BE A CHINA PROXY IN A SENSE AND
 YOU CAN LOOK AT FREEPORT MAC AND
 THAT MAY BE ONE WAY TO PLAY IT
 AND TO DAN'S POINT, WHY NOT BUY
 THE SHANGHAI AND IT'S GOT A TON
 OF ROOM TO RUN.
 THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR HAS
 BEEN FEELING SOME HURT LATELY
 AND IT'S OUR CHART OF THE DAY
 AND THE WORST PERFORMING SECTOR
 IN THE S&P 500
 THE CAUSE, THE HEALTH INSURERS
 LIKE UNH, CIGNA, ANTHEM AND
 HUMANA WEIGHING ON THE SECTOR
 AND ONE OF THE TRADERS THINKS
 HEALTH CARE MIGHT BE THE CURE
 AND YOU ALLUDED TO THIS
 DEFENSIVE.
 WHEN THE PROFIT CYCLE IS
 SLOWING YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE
 DEFENSIVE SECTORS AND YOU TALK
 ABOUT TECH AND FINANCIALS AND
 TECH AND FINANCIALS ARE TWO OF
 THE THREE WORST PERFORMING
 SECTORS AS THE PROFIT CYCLE IS
 SLOWING AND WE LOOK AT PROFITS,
 LIQUIDITY AND SENTIMENT AND
 PROFITS AND TOP BUYING GROWTH
 FOR THE HEALTH SQUARE SECTOR IS
 ONE OF THE BEST IN THE S&P AND
 THEY'RE THE ONLY SECTOR WHERE
 ANALYSTS ARE TAKING UP TOP LINE
 AND BOTTOM LINE ESTIMATES AND
 THEY'RE CHEAP ON BASICALLY EVERY
 METRIC YOU HAVE.
 SO I THINK THERE IS A HUGE
 DEMOGRAPHIC STORY IN THERE AND
 TO GET THAT DEMOGRAPHIC STORY
 OUT OF HISTORY IS A GREAT
 OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT'S TRADING
 OFF OF THE HEADLINE.
 THIS IS NOT NEW NEWS AND THIS IS
 PROBABLY GOING TO BE PART OF THE
 SECTOR STORY FOR A LONG TIME AND
 IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY
 POLITICAL HOT-BUTTON ISSUE AND
 ESPECIALLY AS WE GET CLOSER TO
 THE ELECTION, BUT THIS IS NOT
 DISSIMILAR TO THE FACT THAT A
 COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HILLARY
 TWEETED ABOUT DRUG PRICING AND
 SHE WILL CRACK DOWN ON THE
 WEIGHT IN THE NEAR-TERM AND OVER
 THE LONG TERM, IF PROFIT CYCLES
 ARE TURNING AND THAT WILL DO
 WELL FOR THE SECTOR.
 YOU BOUGHT ANTHEM JUST THE
 OTHER DAY.
 I HAD TO GOING INTO THIS AND
 THEN I BOUGHT SOME TWO DAYS AGO,
 AND I TRIED TO BUY SOME TODAY
 AND I TRIED TO BUY SOME OPTIONS
 TODAY AND THEY WERE THIN AND
 WIDE, SO UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T
 GET ANYTHING DONE.
 I THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY,
 REALLY OVERDONE.
 TWO DAYS AGO I BOUGHT IT AT A
 MUCH WORSE PRICE THAN IT IS
 TODAY, BUT EVERYTHING YOU'RE
 SAYING THESE ARE GREAT COMPANIES
 AND PROFITABLE COMPANIES AND
 THEY ARE IN A SORT OF -VORTEX
 OF NEGATIVE NEWS AND SO I LIKE
 IT WHEN THINGS TRADE DOWN BY
 INTEGERS OR -RIGHT
 $10 AT A TIME NOW.
 I'VE HAD ENOUGH LIKING IT AND I
 WOULD PREFER TO BOTTOM OUT RIGHT
 NOW, BUT I THINK IT'S VERY
 ATTRACTIVE HERE.
 I THINK YOU WILL SEE THIS DIE
 DOWN AND WE'VE SEEN THIS THREAT
 SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE OVER THE
 LAST -EVER SINCE OBAMA CARE,
 AND I THINK YOU WOULD SEE IT
 DRIVE DOWN AND THIS IS
 TREMENDOUS VALUE
 WHEN ARE THE ELECTIONS, GUY
 NOT A TRICK QUESTION
 IT'S WANT A TRICK QUESTION
 NOVEMBER 2020, IS THAT RIGHT?
 CAN THEY DO THAT DING DING
 WHY DID I ASK YOU
 BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO MAKE ME
 LOOK FOOLISH
 I KNEW BECAUSE THE HEADLINE
 RISK TO THIS GROUP WILL LAST
 THROUGH AT LEAST -I AGREE WITH
 THAT IN SOME WAYS AND I DISAGREE
 WITH THAT.
 I WANTED TO ADD ONE OTHER
 POINT.
 ANTHEM.
 THEY HAVE $5 BILLION LEFT IN
 THEIR BUY BACK
 I DID CALL AND I DIDN'T HEAR
 BACK AND MAYBE THEY'LL INCREASE
 THEIR BUYBACK AND I DON'T THINK
 THEY'LL BE OUT THERE BEFORE THEY
 REPORT AND IT WOULD AREN'T BE
 SURPRISING TO ME TO SEE SOME OF
 THESE HMOs OUT THERE AND THEY DO
 BIG BUYBACKS
 BUT YOU ARE CORRECT
 YOU HAVE UNTIL NOVEMBER 2020
 WHEN THIS WILL BE IN THE
 CROSSHAIRS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE
 AND IT WILL WEIGH IN IN TERMS OF
 THE RHETORIC
 LOOK AT THE QUARTER YESTERDAY
 WAS AN OUTSTANDING QUARTER AND
 THEY ACTUALLY RAISED GUIDANCE.
 YOU HAVE A STOCK THAT'S TRADING
 AT 13 TIMES FORWARD EARNINGS AND
 THE LAST FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE IS
 TAKEN AND TRADING 21 TIMES
 FORWARD EARNINGS AND THAT'S THE
 GOOD NEWS.
 THE BAD NEWS IS 96% OF THE
 ANALYSTS HAVE A BUY ON IT AND I
 DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY SELLS
 ON IT WHICH IS A BIT OF A
 PROBLEM BECAUSE NOW YOU MIGHT
 HAVE SOME ANALYST REVERSING
 NUMBERS.
 THAT BEING SAID, YOU ARE TALKING
 ABOUT TROUGH VALUATIONS AT A
 COMPANY THAT'S DOING
 EXTRAORDINARILY WELL WHERE
 PEOPLE ARE SHOOTING FIRST AND
 ASKING QUESTIONS LATER
 SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE
 ONBOARD AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF
 THIS STUFF WILL GO THROUGH AND
 THE RHETORIC WILL DAY DOWN AND
 UNH, WHENEVER IT IS NOW, 220 WAS
 A GIFT.
 AND LOOK AT THE E TRS F, XLV,
 LOOK AT HOW IT TRADED TODAY.
 HUGE VOLUME ON THIS PUKE TYPE OF
 SDMING WHEN I FEEL LIKE I WANT
 TO VOMIT ON MY SHOES THOSE ARE
 THE BEST TRADES AND SO THAT'S
 WHAT TODAY IN HEALTH CARE LOOK
 LIKE
 ALL RIGHT
 WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS IN THE
 CANNABIS SPACE FOR WEED WEEK,
 IRONICALLY
 IT'S BUYING ACREAGE HOLDINGS AND
 THIS AFTER THE FLURRY OF DEALS
 WE'VE SEEP IN THE SPACE.
 ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO
 THE COMPANY THE TWO HAVE BEEN IN
 TALKS FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS AND
 THEY'RE SKEDZ YOU WILLED TO HAVE
 A CALL TONIGHT TO FINALIZE THE
 DEAL AND POSSIBLY ANNOUNCE THIS
 DEAL AS EARLY AS TOMORROW
 MORNING AND THIS DEAL CAME
 TOGETHER VERY QUICKLY.
 CANOPY GROWTH WAS LOOKING AT
 OTHER MULTI-STATE OPERATORS HERE
 IN THE UNITED STATES AND IF YOU
 THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT THIS
 DEAL AND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE
 INDUSTRY, REMEMBER, THAT
 CONSOLATION BRANDS IS A MAJOR
 SHAREHOLDERS AND STAKE HOLDER IN
 CANOPY GROWTH AND IT ALLOWS
 CONSOLATION BRANDS TO HAVE A
 PIECE OF THE U.S. CANNABIS
 MARKET
 SO IT IS BELIEVED BY INDUSTRY
 INSIDERS THAT THIS COULD BE THE
 TEMPLATE FOR A LOT MORE OF THESE
 TYPES OF DEALS TO HAPPEN FOR
 U.S. MAJOR COMPANIES TO HAVE A
 PIECE OF THE U.S. CANNABIS
 MARKET
 SO THAT IS WHAT WE'RE WATCHING
 TONIGHT.
 WE'LL HAVE MORE DETAILS TO SEE
 SOME OF THE OTHER TARGETS THAT
 HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY CANOPY
 LATER ON AND ALSO WE'VE GOT BEN
 KOVLER, THE CEO OF GREEN THUMB,
 AND WE'LL GET HIS TAKE ON WHAT
 THIS COULD MEAN AND THIS COULD
 BE A MAJOR DEAL AND CANOPY
 GROWTH BUYING ACREAGE HOLDINGS.
 NOT ONLY COULD THIS BE A BIG
 DEAL, BUT THE TEMPLATE FOR OTHER
 WAYS TO GET INTO THIS.
 MANY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN TRYING
 TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS KIND OF
 THE MOST -THE BEST LEGAL WAY
 TO GET INTO THIS WITHOUT RUNNING
 ANY INTO ANY ISSUES.
 THIS COULD BE THE WAY THAT THEY
 DO IT.
 IT COULD PUMP UP VALUATION, BUT
 IT COULD BE GOOD FOR A TRADE
 HERE IN THE ENTIRE FACE BECAUSE
 THE WHOLE SPACE WILL A BE HIGHER
 OR WHAT THE TAKEOVER VALUE IS.
 OKAY.
 MEANTIME, WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS.
 ZOOM PRICING THE IPO
 LET'S GET TO LESLIE PICKER FOR
 THE PRICING.
 MELISSA, THIS IS ACCORDING TO
 A SOURCE WITH THE PRICING
 DISCUSSIONS AND I AM TOLD THAT
 ZOOM HAS PRICED ITS IPO AT $36
 THAT IMPLIES AN OFFERING SIZE OF
 $751 MILLION
 A VALUATION OF $9.2 BILLION IN
 THE OSMARKET CAP AND PRICING IT
 DOLLAR ABOVE THE RANGE
 I AM TOLD THAT THIS IFRP COULD
 HAVE PRICED EVEN HIGHER THAN
 THAT BASED ON THE DEMAND THAT
 CAME IN THE DOOR AND THE COMPANY
 WANTED TO STAY CONSERVATIVE TO
 ENSURE A DEBUT TOMORROW.
 LESLIE PICKER AT HEADQUARTERS
 AND THIS WAS EXPECTED FOR THE
 SOFTWARE COMPANY, PRICED ABOVE
 THE RANGE?
 ANYBODY FOLLOWING THIS
 PRIVATELY, THEY HAD THIS
 THING VALUED AT A BILLION.
 WHAT DID LEASLIE VALUE IT?
 9 BILLION.
 PINTEREST, I HAVE A PAGE AND
 WE TRADED TRADE IT OR FADE IT?
 VALUE TRADE
 AND I SAID VALUE TRADE.
 KAREN MAKES A GOOD POINT.
 IT'S NOT A VALUE AT ALL.
 NO, IT'S NOT.
 UNVALUATION.
 60% REVENUE GROWTH.
 I HAVE A BILLION USERS IN A
 COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEY WENT
 SLOW AND STEADY, PINTEREST
 I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE HAD A PAGE
 FOR AT LEAST THE LAST SIX OR
 SEVEN.
 I FEEL THAT MEANS THAT YOU
 SHOULDN'T BUY IT
 PINTEREST SHOULD REALLY CONTACT
 YOU TO HAVE YOU TAKE YOUR PAGE
 DOWN
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 OH, WOW
 THE LAUGHTER IS FANTASTIC
 THE ONE THING ABOUT THE ZOOM
 PRICING, THOUGH, I THINK IT
 PROBABLY ERASES THE NEGATIVE
 TONE FROM THE LIFT PRICING AND
 IT WENT ABOVE RANGE HERE AND
 PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT MAYBE
 THE UNICORNS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
 COME OUT ANDER
 FORM AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT TRADE,
 BUT THIS IS GENERALLY A POSITIVE
 SIGN FOR THE IPO MARKET.
 THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS IT
 MAKES MONEY, RIGHT
 APPARENTLY SOMETHING THAT'S NOW
 ENVOGUE
 EN VOGUE AND I THINK IT WILL BE
 INTERESTING TO SEE HOW ZOOM
 TRADES TOMORROW VERSUS
 PINTEREST.
 I MEAN -I KNOW THAT'S A LOT OF
 EBITDA AND A LOT OF GROWTH AND
 STILL IT'S A LOT OF LOSSES, TOO.
 COMING UP, ZOOM PRICING
 MOMENTS AGO AND WE'RE STILL
 AWAITING PINTEREST AND THE CEO
 OF CASPAR IS HERE AS THE
 MATTRESS DELIVERY GIANT IS
 GEARING UP FOR ITS IPO
 PLUS, LAS VEGAS SANDS JUMPING
 AND WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT WALL

 QUARTER AND THERE IS A STOCK
 GEARING UP FOR EARNINGS TOMORROW
 AND TRADERS ARE BETTING IT IS
 ABOUT TO CRASH

 ALL-TIME HIGH AS THAT STOCK
 CONTINUES TO GRIND HIGHER.
 IF YOU WANT TO DIG INTO FAST
 FOOD WHERE DO YOU GO AND
 IRONICALLY I ASKED KAREN THIS
 WHO DOESN'T EAT FAST FOOD.
 BUT IF I DID I'D PROBABLY GO
 TO McDONALD'S.
 I MEAN, IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE
 RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE OTHER
 MAIMS AND THEY'VE BEEN EXECUTING
 REALLY WELL.
 CHIPOTLE, KUDOS TO THEM THEY'VE
 DONE A FANTASTIC JOB, BUT I FEEL
 LIKE THEY ARE ON THE HIGH WIRE
 YOU IN
 ANY TINY MISS AND THE
 EXPECTATIONS ARE VERY HIGH COULD
 REALLY EXECUTE CLOSER AND I
 WOULD LIKE TO BE IN McDONALD'S
 AND THE RISK REWARD IS MORE
 ATTRACTIVE.
 KUDOS TO PIPER JAFFRAY.
 SHE'S BEEN THE AXE IN THE CMG
 FOR THE LAST COUPLE HUNDRED
 THERE ARES AND I THINK THE
 VALUATION IS RIDICULOUS IN CMG
 AND I'VE THOUGHT THAT FOR THE
 LAST $150 AND EVEN McDONALD'S
 NOW IS GETTING A LITTLE RICH
 THEY'LL REPORT ON APRIL 30th AND
 CLOSE TO 22 TIMES FORWARD
 EARNINGS AND HISTORICALLY IT'S
 THE LOFTIER, FROTHIER END FOR
 THEM SO THEY BETTER CRUSH ON
 APRIL 30th, BUT TO YOUR POINT
 EARLIER IT CONTINUES TO BE SLOW
 AND STEADY TO THE UPSIDE AND
 MAYBE THE TRADE IN McDONALD'S
 WILL PULL THE RIP CORD BEFORE
 THEY REPORT.
 McDONALD'S IS ROLLING OUT
 THEIR TECH PLATFORM, RIGHT
 IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AND
 THAT'S WHAT McDONALD'S IS DOING
 JUST NOW AND IF THERE'S THE
 OTHER COMPANIES ARE A GUIDE, ONE
 MIGHT THINK THAT THEIR SALES AND
 EARNINGS WILL INCREASE QUITE A
 BIT BECAUSE OF THIS.
 I WOULD STICK WITH THE
 McDONALD'S.
 WHEN THINGS ARE SLOWING IS A
 DOLLAR MENU DEFENSIVE?
 YEAH.
 WE ARE PROBABLY WITHIN THE
 DISCRETIONARY SPACE AND WITHIN
 RESTAURANT, DEFINITELY
 McDONALD'S WOULD OPERATE MORE
 LIKE A STAPLES COMPANY
 I WOULD JUST BE A LITTLE BIT,
 AND I WOULD BE CAUTIOUS OVERALL
 ON THOSE TYPES WAS NAMES BECAUSE
 THEY'RE CYCLICAL, RIGHT?
 I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING
 WORSE AND YOU WANT TO AVOID
 THOSE TYPES OF RESTAURANTS AND
 TYPICALLY, THE BIG DEBATE RIGHT
 NOW IS THE ECONOMY SLOWING AND
 ARE PEOPLE GOING TO START LOSING
 THEIR JOBS AND YOU SEE SOME
 BOUNCING AROUND AND IF THAT
 HAPPENS AND YOU WANT TO BE WAY
 MORE CAUTIOUS ON THOSE TYPES OF
 NAMES.
 TO YOUR POINT ON TECHNOLOGY,
 McDONALD'S ISN'T GOING TO BE THE
 FIRST RESTAURANT TO ROLL OUT
 TECHNOLOGY
 THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER
 RESTAURANTS WHO WILL REMAIN
 NAMELESS, BUT THEY HAVE
 TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE APPS THAT I
 WON'T USE.
 IT COULD BACKFIRE
 I THINK STARBUCKS HAS A GOOD
 ONE.
 I THINK McDONALD'S --
 SO YOU DON'T GO TO CHUCK E.
 CHEESE
 THEIR APP IS AMAZING.

 STILL AHEAD, THE IPO IS HAVING A
 BOOM, AND WE AWAIT PINTEREST
 WE WILL TALK TO THE CEO OF
 CASPAR AS THE MATTRESS DELIVERY
 GIANT COULD BE GEARING UP FOR
 ITS IPO.
 WE'LL ASK HIM.
 MUCH MORE "FAST MONEY" COMING UP
 RIGHT AFTER THIS
 WELCOME BACK TO DWOET FAST
 MONEY.
 IMF MADNESS IS IN FULL SWING
 TWO TECH UNICORNING COMING UP
 TONIGHT.
 WE ARE STILL AWAITING PINTEREST.
 LESLIE PICKER IS WITH US
 ZOOM JUST PRICED ITS IPO AT
 $36 A SHARE ACCORDING TO A
 PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE
 DISCUSSIONS AND THAT VALUES THE
 VIDEOCONFERENCING PROVIDER ABOVE
 $9 BILLION
 THE COMPANY HAD RAISED THE RANGE
 IT INITIALLY MARKETED TO
 INVESTORS ON STRONG DEMAND AND
 THE $36 PER SHARE WAS ABOVE THAT
 BOOSTED RANGE.
 PINTEREST IS SET TO TIMIZE ITS
 OWN IPO PRICE DURING A MEETING
 THAT BEGINS IN ABOUT A HALF AN
 HOUR OR SO
 I AM TOLD THAT ONE WAS ALSO IN
 DEMAND FROM INVESTORS AND AIMS
 TO PRICE ABOVE THE RANGE IT HAD
 BEEN MARKETING, AS WELL.
 COMBINED, THOSE TWO COMPANIES
 COULD UNLEASH MORE THAN THEIR 2
 BILLION WORTH OF STOCK INTO THE
 MARKETPLACE AND THEY COULD
 REPRESENT A NICE RESET FOR THE
 TECH IPO MARKET AS LYFT
 CONTINUES TO TRADE ABOVE THE
 PRICE, BUT THESE TWO AND EVERY
 IPO COMES WITH EMBEDDED RISKS,
 OF COURSE, ESPECIALLY FOR RETAIL
 INVESTORS WHO TEND TO GET A MUCH
 SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE
 ALLOCAT
 ALLOCATION EVEN THOUGH THEY SEEK
 ALLOCATION IN PINTEREST.
 THE TRADING TOMORROW SHOULD
 PROVIDE A SENSE OF HOW INVESTORS
 FEEL ABOUT PROFIT.
 PINTEREST POSTED LOSSES ALTHOUGH
 THEY WERE NARROWING WHILE ZOOM
 WAS PROFITABLE AND BOTH
 COMPANIES WERE SHOWING TOP LINE
 GROWTH MORE THAN DOUBLING YEAR
 OVER YEAR.
 ZOOM WILL BE LISTED ON THE
 NASDAQ UNDER THE SYMBOL ZM AND
 PINTEREST WILL BE LISTED IN THE
 NYSE UNDER PNS
 BRIAN KELLY
 THAT'S ME
 WILL IT HELP A LITTLE BIT
 I THINK IT DOES HELP A BIT.
 I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING
 HERE
 THE FACT THAT ZOOM TRADED ABOVE
 OR PRICED ABOVE IS VERY GOOD
 WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THEY BOTH
 TRADE BECAUSE TO KAREN'S POINT
 WE'LL GET WHAT THE MARKET FEELS
 LIKE ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT TO
 HAVE REAL EARNINGS OR WHETHER
 YOU WANT TO HAVE KIND OF GROWTH
 IN THAT NETWORK EFFECT AND SO
 FAR, LYFT HAS SAID MAYBE THAT'S
 NOT THE BEST THING AND WE'LL SEE
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PINTEREST
 STARTS TRADING
 THE NEXT TECH UNICORN COULD BE
 AROUND THE CORNER.
 KASPER IS A MATTRESS FIRM THAT'S
 VALUED MORE THAN A BILLION
 DOLLAR AND THE COMPANY HAS HIRED
 UNDERWRITERS FOR ITS VERY OWN
 IPO.
 WHEN WILL UMP ABOARD THE IPO
 MANIA.
 WE ARE JOINED BY PHILIP KRIM
 NO COMMENT ON CASPER IPO AND
 GREAT FOR ZOOM AND PINTEREST AND
 WE CERTAINLY THINK THE IPO
 MARKET IS ROBUST AND GREAT TO
 SEE SO MUCH EXCITEMENT.
 THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF OTHER
 ONLINE, DIRECT TO CONSUMER
 MATTRESS COMPANIES
 HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE AMONGST
 THEM
 WHAT IF THEY DECIDE TO ALL GO
 PUBLIC HERE?
 WE THINK CASPER STAND ALONE AND
 EVERYTHING WE DO IS ABOUT
 HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS SLEEP
 BETTER AND WE THINK ABOUT END TO
 END ABOUT SLEEP AND IT'S ABOUT
 THE GREAT MASS TRESS AND
 EVERYTHING TO HELP YOU SLEEP AND
 WE HELPED LAUNCH A LIGHTING
 PRODUCT THAT HELPS YOU WAKE UP
 BETTER AND SLEEP BETTER AND THE
 MARKET END TO END ABOUT SLEEP
 SOLUTIONS AND WE WANT TO BE THE
 WORLD'S FIRST GLOBAL SLEEP BRAND
 AND WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO
 DOING THAT
 NOT THAT YOU LOOK AT COMPANIES
 THAT ARE PUBLICLY TRADED, BUT IF
 YOU DID, WHICH ONES ARE SIMILAR
 TO YOU AND NOT NECESSARILY BEING
 A MATTRESS COMPANY, BUT THE IDEA
 OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE?
 WE THINK WE'RE ONE OF THE
 FIRST OF OUR KIND MEANING WE'RE
 A DIGITALLY NATIVE, WITH
 CASPER.COM
 WE OPENED UP 23 RETAIL STORES.
 WE HAVE GREAT PARTNERS WITH
 FOLKS LIKE TARGET AND WE BELIEVE
 THAT WE WILL HAVE A BUSINESS
 WHERE NO MATTER HOW CONSUMERS
 WANT TO SHOP FOR OUR PRODUCTS WE
 HAVE GREAT PRODUCTS AND GREAT
 EXPERIENCES AND WE THINK THERE
 IS NOT A PUBLIC COMPANY COMP
 THAT'S DONE THAT JOURNEY
 GO AHEAD, B.K
 YOU ANNOUNCED A NEW MATTRESS
 THAT HAS THE BOX SPRINGS IN IT,
 THE METAL.
 WHEN YOU SHIP THOSE, DOES THAT
 CHANGE THE MARGINS ON THE
 MATTRESS VERSUS WHAT YOU WERE
 DOING IN THE PAST?
 YESTERDAY WE LAUNCHED THE
 INNER SPRING TECHNOLOGY AND FOAM
 TECHNOLOGY AND WE LAUNCHED TWO
 DIFFERENT MODELS AROUND THAT
 FOR US, WE ARE STILL ABLE TO
 COMPRESS THOSE MATTRESSES, SHIP
 THEM ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND
 THEY'RE REALLY PHENOMENAL
 PRODUCTS THAT WERE IN
 DEVELOPMENT OVER A YEAR IN THE
 CASPER LABS FROM SAN FRANCISCO
 YOU CAN COMPRESS IT AND SHIP IT
 ANYWHERE AND IT'S SUPER FUN TO
 OPEN AND THEY SLEEP REALLY,
 REALLY GREAT.
 CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE UPSELL
 THEN
 AND IT'S A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
 AND SOMEBODY BUYS A MATTRESS AND
 ARE THEY BUYING THE LIGHTING
 PROCESS AND ARE THEY BUYING THE
 PILLOWS AND THE SHEETS
 THE PILLOWS
 PEOPLE MIGHT HEAR PILLOW.
 I HAVE TROUBLE SAYING LIKE
 PILLOW IS WHAT I SAY
 ANYWAY --
 I FORGOT MY QUESTION.
 HOPEFULLY YOU REMEMBER.
 WE MAKE GREAT PILLOWS AND
 GREAT SHEETS AND GREAT LIGHTING
 PRODUCTS AND WE ARE SEEING
 HIGHER AND HIGHER ATTACHMENT
 RATES AND WE ARE SEEING REPEAT
 REVENUE INCREASE DRAMATICALLY
 AND WE'RE ONLY A 5-YEAR-OLD
 COMPANY, ACTUALLY THIS MONTH AND
 WE LAUNCHED APRIL 2014 AND AS WE
 GET OUR CUSTOMERS TO BE MORE
 MATURE WE'RE SEEING THEM COME
 BACK TIME AND TIME AGAIN, TO BUY
 MATTRESSES AND OUR FULL SUITE OF
 PRODUCTS
 I AM OLD FASHIONED IN BUYING
 SOMETHING LIKE A MATTRESS.
 I'LL BUY EVERYTHING ELSE ONLINE
 INCLUDING FOOD AND SHAMPOO, BUT
 NOT A MATTRESS
 SO IF I ORDER IT AND I DON'T
 WANT IT, THAT'S A PAIN IN THE
 YOU KNOW WHAT TO RETURN, TO SEND
 BACK
 NO
 WE CHANGED THE WAY THAT YOU
 WOULD RETURN IT.
 THE INDUSTRY, YES, IT'S A HUGE
 PAIN, BUT WITH US, WE CALL US UP
 AND WE'LL COME PICK UP THE
 MATTRESS
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO PACK IT BACK
 UP AND WE DONATE IT LOCALLY AND
 WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU GIVE US A
 SHOT
 WE CHANGED WAIT PEOPLE SHOP FOR
 THE PRODUCTS AND WE HAVE 23
 STORES THAT WE'VE OPENED
 WE'RE OPENING UP OVER A DOZEN
 THIS QUARTER
 TWO THIS WEEK, IN FACT AND THOSE
 STORES ARE A GREAT COMPLIMENT TO
 THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE AND NO
 MATTER HOW YOU WANT TO SHOP FOR
 THE PRODUCTS WE WANT TO SOLVE
 THAT.
 GIVEN THOSE EMBEDDED COSTS?
 NO PUN INTENDED, ARE YOU
 MAKING MONEY ON EVERY MATTRESS
 YOU SELL
 WE DON'T BREAK OUT
 PROFITABILITY, BUT CASPER HAS A
 GREAT PRODUCT AND A GREAT
 BUSINESS MODEL AND BY TAKING IT
 TO MARKET BOTH ONLINE AND OFF
 LINE THIS IT'S GROWING OUR
 ONLINE BUSINESS IN A VERY
 EFFICIENT WAY, SO WE THINK THIS
 GO TO MARKET STRATEGY IS WORKING
 WELL AND WE'RE IN THE EARLY DAYS
 OF SCALING IT AND WE CAN KEEP
 BUILDING IT OUT FOR YEARS TO
 COME
 PHIL, A THANKS FOR JOINING
 US
 PHILIP KRIM, THE CEO OF KRCASPE
 YEAH, WHY NOT
 IT'S BETTER THAN AN AIR
 MATTRESS
 OF COURSE, I WOULD DO THIS.
 IT'S AN UPGRADE TO WHAT YOU
 HAVE NOW.
 YEAH.
 YOU DON'T SLEEP ON AIR

 IT'S DEFINITELY TURNING AND
 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
 WYNN WAS UP 105 AND WE STARTED
 TALKING ABOUT THIS, THE FACT
 THAT THE CHINESE WERE THROWING
 THE KITCHEN SINK AT THE ECONOMY
 AND THEY WERE PROBABLY GOING TO
 BE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THEIR
 ASSET PRICES BACK UP AND THAT'S
 COME TO FRUITION AND WYNN'S HAD
 A DECENT MOVE AND LAS VEGAS SAND
 HIS A MOVE AND LVS AT 19 TIMES

    cramped and uncomfortable.
 We can arrange a little upgrade.

 They have extra room throughout.
       They're like a luxury         ride for my feet.

 THE STOCK YOU SEE THERE JUMPING IN THE AFTER-HOURS
 SESSION AND THIS ADDS TO THE
 FLURRY OF DEALS AND IT IS WEED
 WEEK AND WE'LL KEEP THE GOOD
 TIMES ROLLING AND HE IS NOT ONLY
 AN HEIR TO THE JIM BEAM BOURBON
 FORTUNE AND THE BOOMING CANNABIS
 COMPANY AND GREEN THUMB
 INDUSTRIES AND THANK YOU FOR
 BEING WITH US.
 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON
 THIS DEAL AND THIS IS A GREAT
 DAY FOR THE MULTI-STATE
 OPERATORS AND THE ARGUMENT WAS
 THAT THEY TRADING AT A DISCOUNT
 TO THE CANADIAN COUSINS AND IT
 LIMITS THEIR OPTIONS
 YEAH.
 THIS ONLY REINFORCES WHAT WE'VE
 BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR SO LONG
 THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IN CANNABIS
 IS HERE IN THE U.S. AND THIS IS
 WHERE THE MARKET IS.
 THIS IS A $50 TO $80 BILLION
 INDUSTRY WHERE TOTAL MARKET
 CAPITALIZATION IS STILL UNDER 15
 BILLION.
 SO IT'S A REALLY EXCITING TIME
 AND THE U.S. IS WHERE THE
 OPERATORS WANT TO BE AND IT'S
 NOT ONLY CANADIAN OPERATORS AND
 IT'S FOOD AND BEVERAGE, TOBACCO,
 CPB BUSINESSES STUDDYING THE
 SPACE.
 SO BASICALLY, THEY WILL FIND
 A WAY TO GET AROUND THE
 RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR BUSINESS
 AND INVESTING IN A FEDERALLY
 ILLEGAL BUSINESS IS WHAT YOU'RE
 THINKING
 EVERYBODY IS STUDYING IT.
 IN ORDER TO HAVE SUCCESS YOU
 HAVE TO HAVE THE COST OF CAPITAL
 AND WE BUILT A BUSINESS IN U.S.
 IN LIMITED ACROSS THE COUNTRY
 WHERE EVERYONE WAS RESTRICTED
 AND THE TIDE IS CHANGING AND
 IT'S QUITE AN EXCITING TIME.
 YOU LOOK AT THIS DEAL IN THE
 SPACE AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU
 AND YOU SEE CONSTELLATION HAVING
 A STAKE IN CANOPY AND CANOPY
 BUYING A MULTI-STATE OPERATOR
 AND DO YOU THINK NOW THAT YOUR
 OPTIONS IN TERMS OF WHO YOU
 MIGHT COMBINE WITH DOWN THE ROAD
 WILL EITHER BE SOONER OR LATER
 HAS ACTUALLY WIDENED
 WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE
 DETAILS OF THIS DEAL ARE AND
 EXACTLY HOW IT'S STRUCTURED AND
 WHAT IT MEANS FOR SHAREHOLDERS
 AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR BUSINESS
 ANDTHE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS I
 THROUGH OUR LENS AND WHAT'S BEST
 FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND HOW WE
 CREATE VALUE AND I WOULD BE
 INTERESTED TO STUDY THE DETAILS
 OF THIS.
 HAVE YOU BEEN APPROACHED BY
 CANOPY.
 WE ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE IN
 ALL SECTORS AND THE PHONE RINS A
 LOT BECAUSE THERE IS WHERE THE
 OPPORTUNITY IS
 IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU THINK
 IT'S MOST PROMISING AND THEY'RE
 OPENING UP SOME SORT OF LEGAL
 RECREATIONAL OR MEDICAL.
 FOR INSTANCE, JUST BECAUSE NEW
 YORK MIGHT LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL
 AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A MARKET
 THAT COULD BE PROFITABLE FOR
 YOU?
 WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
 STUDYING IT AND BUILT THE
 BUSINESS FIVE YEARS AGO STARTING
 IN ILLINOIS, NEVADA,
 MASSACHUSETTS AND PENNSYLVANIA,
 OHIO, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT
 ALL OF WHICH ARE STUDYING AND
 FIGURING OUT HOW TO LEGALIZE TAX
 AND REGULATE AND FUNDAMENTALLY
 IN THE U.S. CANNABIS STANDS IN
 THE CROSS SECTION OF THE OPIOID
 EPIDEMIC THAT IS KILLING PEOPLE
 AND CANNABIS OFFERS RELIEF FOR
 THAT AND U.S. STATES THAT ARE
 BANKRUPT AND NEED REVENUE AND
 CANNABIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
 MONSTROUS TAX REVENUE.
 DO YOU THINK THAT CASE IS
 REALLY BEING BORNE OUT IN THAT
 CALIFORNIA, FOR INSTANCE, LAST
 YEAR THE AMOUNT OF STATE TAX
 REVENUE BROUGHT IN FROM CANNABIS
 WAS ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT HAD
 BEEN PROJECTED AND THAT THERE'S
 ACTUALLY SO MUCH COMPETITION
 FROM THE BLACK MARKET WHICH
 DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY OVERHEAD AND
 DOESN'T PAY TAXES OR ANYTHING
 LIKE THAT THAT IT'S DIFFICULT
 FOR THESE BUSINESSES TO THRIVE
 AND TO GENERATE THE TAX REVENUE
 THAT STATES WANTED TO HAVE
 SO CALIFORNIA IS AN ANOMALY
 AND THE OLDEST AND BIGGEST
 MARKET AND IF YOU LOOK AT NEVADA
 WITH OVER 100 MILLION AND YOU'RE
 ABOUT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN
 MASSACHUSETTS AS IT TAKES OVER
 AND THE DOLLARS ARE VERY REAL
 AND WE'RE ABLE TO BUILD SCHOOLS
 AND HELP COMMUNITIES
 HOW IMPORTANT IS CAPITAL AT
 THIS POINT
 CAPITAL IS DIFFICULT TO COME BY
 FOR THIS INDUSTRY AT THIS POINT.
 HOW IMPORTANT IS CAPITAL IN
 TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO BUY THE
 LICENSES IN THE STATES THAT OPEN
 UP
 PART OF YOU ARE WORK IS TO
 WIN THE LICENSES IN A
 COMPETITIVE PROCESS, FOR
 EXAMPLE, NEW JERSEY HAD 146
 APPLICANTS AND WE FINISHED
 SECOND
 WE WERE ABLE TO WIN A LICENSE
 THAT'S MOST ACCRETIVE TO
 SHAREHOLDERS AND WE'RE STUDYING
 THE MARKET FOR LICENSES AND IT'S
 AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE
 WE GET SYNERGIES IN ACQUISITION.
 I'M ASKING THIS IN A BROADER
 SENSE IN THAT THIS DEAL WILL
 THEORETICALLY HIGHLIGHT THE
 VALUE OR THE DISCOUNT THAT
 MULTI-STATE OPERATORS WERE
 TRADING AT VERSUS CANADIAN
 COMPANIES.
 WE WENT PUBLIC A YEAR AGO ON
 THAT DISCOUNT KNOWING THE
 OPPORTUNITY IS HERE.
 I THINK TOMORROW IS ANOTHER STEP
 ALONG THE WAY OF THE U.S.
 INVESTOR STARTING TO COULD THAT
 THE OPPORTUNITY USING U.S. MSOs
 LISTED IN CANADA AND THIS IS
 WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY IS AND I
 THINK YOU SEE CONTINUED INTEREST
 IN THE SPACE.
 IS YOUR PHONE RINGING AS WE
 SPEAK?

 THANKS FOR JOINING US
 BEN COBLER OF GTI, GREEN THUMB
 INDUSTRIES.
 CONSTELLATION BRANDS.
 YOU GET THE STOCK THAT TROUGHED
 LATE LAST YEAR AND EARLIER THIS
 YEAR AND IT'S BEEN OFF TO THE
 RACES SINCE.
 I'M NOT SUGGESTING IT'S THEIR
 INVESTMENT IN THE INDUSTRY AND
 IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT
 CLEARLY.
 TO BEN'S POINT THERE ARE SO MANY
 INDUSTRIES THAT WILL BE
 DISRUPTED AND WE TALKED ABOUT
 COSMETICS AND SPIRITS AND BEER
 AND IT'S NOT GOING AWAY ANY TIME
 SOON.
 YEAH, JUST LOOK AT THE SECTOR
 IN GENERAL
 I THINK YOU GET THE VALUATIONS
 MUCH HIGHER BECAUSE THIS COULD
 SPARK A REALLY BIG RALLY
 ALL RIGHT.
 BY THE WAY, WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE
 ON THE BIG CANOPY DEAL TOMORROW.
 I'LL BE SPEAKING WITH THE CEO OF
 CANOPY GROWTH BRUCE LINTON AND
 KEVIN MURPHY, SQUAWK BOX AT 6:50
 A.M. WE'LL HAVE THE DETAILS OF
 THE DEAL THEN.
 COMING UP, THIS STOCK IS TRADING
 AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH AND THIS DOW

 MORGAN
 MARIANNE LAKE WILL STEP DOWN AND
 MOVE ON TO BECOME CEO OF
 CONSUMER LENDING
 THERE'S SPECULATION THAT SHE
 COULD BE THE SUCCESSOR TO JAMIE
 DIMON.
 HOW DO YOU READ THESE MOVES?
 I READ THIS AS THIS PUTS HER
 IN POTENTIALLY THE POLE POSITION
 FOR THAT
 I THINK THAT SHE'S THE CFO, BUT
 PEOPLE SAY, ALL RIGHT, SHE'S HAD
 OPERATING EXPERIENCE AND THIS, I
 THINK, WOULD REALLY GIVE HER
 THAT
 IT ALSO CERTAINLY MAKES ONE
 WONDER WITH WELLS FARGO LOOKING
 FOR A CEO, DID THEY COME KNOCK
 ON HER DOOR?
 THAT WOULD AREN'T BE SHOCKING TO
 ANYONE, AND J.P. MORGAN THINKS
 ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE TO SOLIDIFY
 OUR SUCCESSION PLAN EACH THOUGH
 I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG JAMIE WILL
 BE THERE
 I THINK HE'S FANTASTIC, OF
 COURSE, AND AT SOME POINT JAMIE
 WILL LEAVE AND IT ALSO MAKES YOU
 WONDER, ALL RIGHT.
 WHAT ABOUT GORDON SMITH?
 VERY TALENTED AND SHE'S, I
 THINK, LATE 40s AND SHE'S LATE
 50s AND JAMIE, I THINK IS EARLY
 60s.
 SO IT WOULDN'T BE SHOCKING TO
 SEE HER BEING SET UP TO BE THE
 NEXT CEO
 YEAH.
 THAT WAS -I ALWAYS THOUGHT --
 I THOUGHT FOR A WHILE IT WOULD
 BE --
 AND YOU WONDER IF TIM SLOAN
 DIDN'T STEP DOWN IF ALL OF THIS
 HADN'T BEEN IN THE WORKS ANYWAY.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 LET'S STICK WITH FINANCIALS
 AND AMERICAN EXPRESS SHARES UP
 20% AND OUTPERFORMING THE REST
 OF THE SHARES AND THE RALLY
 COULD COME TO AN END AND MIKE KO
 IS HERE WITH THE OPTIONS ACTION.
 HI, MIKE
 THE OPTIONS MARKET IS
 IMPLYING ABOUT A 3% MOVE FOR
 AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THAT'S
 ABOUT IN LINE WITH WHAT IT'S
 AVERAGED OVER THE PAST EIGHT
 QUARTERS AND WHEN I LOOKED AT
 THE OPTIONS ACTIVITY AROUND AN
 HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE THE
 MARKET CLOSED AND IT HAD TRADED
 TWO AND A HALF TIMES THE AVERAGE
 DAILY VOLUME BY THE TIME THE
 MARKET CLOSED AND THEREFORE
 TRADING QUITE A LOT AS THE
 CLOSING BELL APPROACHED AND MOST
 OF THAT ACTIVITY WAS
 CONCENTRATED IN THE 111 AND 107
 PUTS THAT EXPIRE TOMORROW AND
 THE REASON FOR THAT WAS THAT IT
 WAS ACTUALLY PURCHASES OF THE
 111, 107 PUT SPREAD INCLUDING A
 BLOCK OF A THOUSAND OF THOSE
 TRADING FOR 113.
 AND THAT'S REPRESENTING 1% OF
 THE CURRENT STOCK PRICE AND IT
 WILL FALL AS LOW AS 107 AFTER
 THEY REPORT TOMORROW
 THANKS FOR THAT, MIKE
 WE ARE OFF THIS FRIDAY, BUT
 OPTIONS ACTION IS UP NEXT, AND
 WONDER WHY GUY ADAMI IWANG
 THIS UNICORN ONESIE?
 IT'S NOT JUST WHAT HE WEARS
 AROUND THE HOUSE
