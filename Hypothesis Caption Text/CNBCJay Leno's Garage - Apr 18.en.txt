<i> Depends on who you ask.</i> 
- If I tell you this is fun, I don't know what you're gonna put me on next. <i> 
- The power of nostalgia</i> <i> is real.</i> Bring back some memories when you step on that accelerator? 
- Oh, that's lovely. <i> 
- But one thing's for sure.</i> <i> The better the technology,</i> <i> the safer we all are.</i> [groans] 
- You okay, Jay? 
- Yeah, I'm okay. <i> At least that's what</i> <i> I keep telling my wife.</i> Honey, we can get to your mom's house much quicker. <i> As for me,</i> <i> I can't wait to see</i> <i> what the next</i> <i> next generation has in store.</i> Remember, you're never too old to fall down. 
>> On your mark, get set, go. Tonight on Jay Leno's Garage... Fun with your mom's car. Water and cars. 
>> All right, let's do it. Water can power cars... 
>> We're generating steam right now. 
>> But it can also destroy them. So when oil and water mix, is it always trouble? I'm sliding around. To find out, Jeff Dunham and I take to the high seas for the rematch of the century. 
>> Are you kidding me? They're both morons. 
>> [laughing] Comedian Alonzo Bodden and I get our beer goggles on... 
>> Jay Leno, 
>> And it ain't pretty. This is about as dangerous as it gets. We'll go back to the age of steam. There's a fire. Look, I'll drive. 
>> Let's go. 
>> The glory days of firefighting. We'll be there in about 20 minutes. And I'll drive this huge, amphibious monster... 
>> All right, Jay, you're officially feet-wet in a U.S. Navy LCAC. 
>> U.S. Navy's massive, $40 million hovercraft. 
>> Whoa, we're coming around quick. 
>> Mayday, Mayday. Abort mission. I think I've killed everybody on board. Because tonight it's all about going fast, being loud, and mixing oil and water. And the nice thing is, there's no traffic. So put on your Speedo, 'cause I can guarantee we're gonna get wet. Let's do this. [upbeat music] You know, there's an old saying that oil and water don't mix, but in a lot of ways, they do. In this episode, you'll see vehicles that have some connection with water: amphibious vehicles, steam-powered cars, or even a vehicle like this that was styled to look like a boat. the 1916 Crane-Simplex. This was meant to mimic some of the great cigarette boats of the teens. They were fast. They were agile. They were sexy. You enter it like a boat. You get in from the middle. This is all mahogany. All sorts of ship-like cues throughout the whole thing. And this was not an inexpensive car back in the day. In 1916, this car cost $33,000. And when you figure the average home was around $1,200... that's a lot of money. Although this was not especially fast car, it was a very powerful car, much like these locomotives right out the window here. [train engine toots] Thank you. Boy, right on cue. Right now, we're gonna settle a score with Jeff Dunham. 
>> Let's do this. 
>> [laughing] 
>> Last season, we raced 1960s Amphicars. 
>> Come on, you can beat this moron. 
>> Through treachery and deceit, I lost. 
>> Yee-haw! 
>> So we're heading out to Castaic Lake, where we'll have our long-awaited rematch. [dramatic music] Jeff Dunham, a year ago, you and I raced on this very lake, and I lost. But I'm back to settle the score. 
>> Jay Leno: all chin, no action. 
>> Let's see if you can do it again, puppet boy. 
>> At least I can do voices. 
>> This time we're racing WaterCars. Ten times-
- 
>> You sure you wanna-
- 
>> What's that? [laughing] All right, enough of that. Let's check out the WaterCars. [energetic music] I'm seeing these for the first time, just like you are. These are called WaterCars. They're brand-new. Whereas the Amphicar was sort of slow and helped revolutionize drowning, this you can drive like a car. It looks like a Jeep, but you can take it in the water. They've got about 300 horsepower. The Amphicar had, what-
- 
>> Two? 
>> 52 horsepower, something like that? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Let's meet Fred Selby. Fred, come on in. Fred is the--one of the partners, one of the founding partners of this deal. 
>> Hey, Jay. 
>> Explain to him what we have. 
>> Yeah, well, these are WaterCars. They're the fastest amphibious vehicles in the world. They'll do 45 mile an hour in the water. 
>> Really? Pull a skier? 
>> Yeah, it does. 
>> Good Lord. 
>> We make 'em here in Southern California. Sold about 50, and we deliver 'em around the world. We actually build these from scratch. It's a fiberglass hull that we build ourselves. We put a chromoly chassis inside it and embed it all in the fiberglass, then kind of wrap it with closed-cell foam for flotation. And our own pump that pushes it--it's like a big Jet Ski when you're in the water. 
>> And do you steer it with the steering wheel? 
>> When you enter into the water, you do everything just as you're operating a car. 
>> Well, you enter the water in a car, you've probably been drinking. That's the trouble, though. 
>> [laughing] Yeah. It's not hard to enter the water... 
>> Yeah. 
>> In a car. It's hard to exit. 
>> Right, right. 
>> But we can do that here. 
>> So what does it look like when it's in boat mode? 
>> Let me show you. 
>> Okay. It has a sail. [whirring] Oh, that's impressive. 
>> Oh, you're like a kid at a candy store. [moaning] 
>> Well, I do have new twin boys, and they would fit right in the back. 
>> It's for the kids-
- that's what. You're not thinking of yourself. 
>> Never. 
>> What a wonderful father. 
>> I am. Where's the water line? 
>> When you're in the water, you can open the doors. 
>> You can open the doors? 
>> Yeah, it's-
- 
>> And it won't sink? 
>> We've been at this 16 years. 16 year--we've never sunk one. 
>> Well, let's open the hood. Let's see what the engine looks like, yeah. 
>> Let's take a look. It's fairly clean installation. There's a Honda 3.7, single exhaust system on it. 
>> An Amphicar's a freshwater vehicle. Can you take this in seawater? 
>> Yeah, absolutely. 
>> Really? 
>> Our test bed is saltwater. Okay, guys. 
>> Pretty cool. Hey, Jeff, you ready to do it? Let's take these for a ride. 
>> A race. 
>> A race. Let's go for a race. 
>> A race, race. Let's go. 
>> Wait, wait, wait--we got to do a little training on it. 
>> Come on, Jeff, we're Amphi people. 
>> No, no, hey, come on, guys. 
>> How hard can it be? 
>> It's four gears. 
>> No, you need to know how to drive. 
>> I know how to drive. 
>> Jay, Jay, come on. 
>> Fred, don't worry about us. We'll be right. [engines turn over] 
>> Guys... 
>> So this is gonna be just like last time. 
>> Yeah, except it'll be fair this time. 
>> It was fair. 
>> The race will start when we hit the first buoy. And it's two miles to the finish line. 
>> May the best water driver win. 
>> [laughs] Leno and Dunham both begged me to be in this. Are you kidding me? Cars were made to be on land. Boats were made to be on water. That's it. 
>> Are my wheels up? 
>> Yeah. 
>> These guys are dumbasses. Dumbasses, dumb...ass...es. 
>> Pretty amazing vehicle. Just feels like a car that's floating on the water. It's hilarious. 
>> Is this exciting? I don't think so. Do you see anybody on the shore cheering? I don't think so. It's a desolate place. No one cares. 
>> Okay, line 'em up. I'm waiting for Jeff now. Jeff, you ready? 
>> I'm ready. 
>> Did you notice, Leno is not wearing a life vest because if he falls in the water, his chin will keep him afloat. [laughing] See how I did that? It's like a joke. Shut up. 
>> All right, on your mark, get set, go. [exciting music] When that front end goes up, you can't see anything. 
>> Gonna get you, Leno! 
>> [laughing] Yee-haw. I don't think these two machines could be more closely matched. Right now it's just driver's skill. [laughing] All right, this is stupid fun. 45 miles an hour on the water is a lot faster than it is in a car. I'll tell you that. It's pounding here. 
>> [laughs] 
>> Dunham is losing this. There's no doubt about that. I guess he should've let me drive. I weigh less. 
>> When Dunham doesn't have that puppet to help him, he's hopeless. Dunham trying to cut me off. 
>> [chuckling] 
>> I think we got him. I think we got him. By a nose. Yes! Very, very close. The score has been settled. You know, I don't know whether it was the sea spray, but I thought I saw a tear in Jeff's eye when I beat him. Thank you. Thank you. 
>> There is going to be no living with Mr. Dunham. I think I'm gonna find something to do tonight. He's not a good loser. [engines roaring] 
>> [laughing] 
>> What a sore loser. There you have it, folks. I evened the score. What we need now but that'll just have to wait till next season. 
>> Are we done? Did they finish their cute little boat race? It's time for me to go home. Hello, anyone? Nothing. [wind rustling] 
>> Coming up... 
>> This craft's filled up to about 36,000 pounds of fuel, and it'll last probably about five hours. 
>> Wow. How much horsepower does it take to drive one of these? 
>> A lot. Here's a hint: the LCAC makes the Hellcat look like a Volkswagen Bug. SARAH'S LAST TUITION PAYMENT, SENT OFF. FEELING GOOD? OH YEAH. NOW I'M READY TO FOCUS ON MY PROJECT.

>> Not all amphibious vehicles are for fun and games. Some of them serve a much-needed purpose. We're off to Camp Pendleton, where we'll board an LCAC, a land-to-water hovercraft that's built to save lives. [dramatic music] On D-Day, thousands of U.S. Navy landing crafts transported equipment and infantry to the beaches of Normandy. But once they hit land, they were exposed and vulnerable. The invention and evolution of the hovercraft eventually gave birth to U.S. Navy LCAC, allowing for more efficient water-to-land maneuvering, and more importantly, reduction in casualties. Captain Amidon, how are you, sir? 
>> Good morning, welcome to Assault Craft Unit 5, home of The Swift Intruders. 
>> Well, I'm very excited. Yeah, thank you. This should be a lot of fun. 
>> Are you ready to get started? 
>> Let's do it. 
>> All right. 
>> So let's get you changed. 
>> Okay. Ta-da. 
>> Very nice. 
>> We got boots for you, socks... 
>> Oh, great. 
>> A T-shirt, the whole thing. 
>> Cool, cool. So what do the initials LCAC stand for, exactly? 
>> LCAC stands for Landing Craft Air Cushion, so they actually ride on a small cushion of air. 
>> This monster is 87 feet long, weighs 182 tons, and can go up to 70 knots. Basically, if you see this thing coming at you, get out of the way. And lucky me, I get to drive this thing. 
>> First, we need to get you trained up. So we're ready to go through our simulator. 
>> And you put quarters in this, or is it just straight ahead? Am I right here? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> You're right there in that seat. 
>> Okay. Usually, each LCAC pilot must do 196 hours of training. Guys, we're spinning. 
>> Oh, no, we're coming around quick. 
>> Okay, I think I've killed everybody on board. Hang on. But as a former talk show host, 20 minutes should do the trick. Mayday, mayday, abort mission. 
>> [laughing] 
>> Well, let me ask you something. Now, it goes 55 miles an hour. And during R&R, any guys ever try to waterski behind these? 
>> You know, Jay, I've never seen 'em do it, but I don't think they'd make it very long back there behind the prop. 
>> How bad is the wind blast behind it? 
>> So it'd be a Hurricane Katrina... 
>> Really? 
>> Worse. 
>> So the waterskiing thing is out. 
>> It's out. 
>> Okay. 
>> So here at ACU 5, we're a lot like you, you know? We're a self-maintained garage. You know, a lot of people, when they have a boat breaks down, they take it to a shipyard or to a boat shop. We do everything in house. 
>> I know the guys want--just want to know, what kind of horsepower are we talking about here? 
>> A lot. We're looking 5,000 horsepower. 
>> Per engine. 
>> Per engine? 
>> Per engine. 
>> And how many engines on the vehicle? 
>> We have four. 
>> Four--so we're looking at 20,000 horsepower. Okay, now we're talking. 20,000 horsepower. Let's do this. [exciting music] Well, take me through it now, okay? These are your two primary engines to move it forward. But there are other engines in here, correct? 
>> That's correct, sir. 
>> Okay. 
>> So if you go back here after the craft, there's two turbofan engines per side. 
>> Okay, and those spin fans which force the air to lift it up? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Okay, okay. The layout is pretty basic. The engines in the back make it go, and the engines on the side make it hover. Now, can you move one of these when those engines aren't running? 
>> Uh... 
>> I mean, can you even tow it? There aren't, like, any wheels for when it's down... 
>> No, sir. 
>> That can roll, of any kind. So it's to to be running-
- it's got to be running to move. 
>> Right, on its own power. 
>> You're not gonna jump-start. You're not gonna get a bunch of guys--let's push this baby. Get a--jump-start it. 
>> Pop the clutch. 
>> Not gonna happen, no. No popping the clutch on this. Okay. And what is your miles per gallon, would you say? 
>> [laughing] 
>> Or is it gallons per mile? 
>> It's gallons per hour, right? 
>> Gallons per hour. 
>> It's gallons per hour. This craft is filled up to about 36,000 pounds of fuel. It'll last probably about five hours. 
>> Wow, okay. My dad had a Cadillac like that. Wow. Is this goal of this to bring vehicles off-ship into land-
- a tank or whatever it might be? 
>> It was designed for high-speed, ship-to-shore maneuver--to get Marine Corps equipment ashore as quickly as possible. 
>> If you had this, you would've used this at Normandy Beach, in other words. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> It's the latest generation of craft for assaulting the beach. 
>> Just filled with soldiers, and you can come in, okay. All right, I've had enough training. I think it's time we went for a ride. 
>> Clear to come up on cushion for seat. Feet wet when ready. The ship is eight nautical miles now. 
>> Roger. 
>> It'll take about 13 minutes to get there. 
>> Our mission objective: hover fast for three miles and then dock with the USS Comstock. Piece of cake! I've had 20 minutes of training. Let's do this. [dramatic music] 
>> Jay, this is what's called on cushion. We're off of the landing rails, and we're actually floating on a cushion of air. 
>> That's our ship out there on the left? 
>> That's correct, Jay. [dramatic music] All right, Jay, and this is what's called transitioning from feet dry to feet wet. Feet dry over land, feet wet when we get out to sea. [tense music] All right, Jay, you're officially feet wet in a U.S. Navy LCAC. 
>> Very cool. [epic music] It's really much smoother than I thought it would be. It's much smoother than a boat would be under the same circumstances. And it's moving along. What are you, about 45 knots? 
>> We're at 30 right now, Jay. 
>> 30 knots, okay. Ever spot whales out here? 
>> We do. 
>> Yeah? 
>> Quite frequently. All right, Jay, what we did right now is, we came all stop. So I'm gonna get you up in the seat. 
>> Oh, okay. 
>> Sorry. 
>> Tricky up there. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> Okay, this is a lot trickier than it looks. Maybe I needed 22 minutes of training. 
>> It's tricky up there. 
>> This is-
- 
>> Use your right leg first. 
>> It's the helmet that makes it the trickiest. Let me see if I can do this. Here we go. And after some awkward maneuvering, I get to take the helm. And believe me, this ain't no simulator. I feel like I'm in one of those bad movies where the admiral's son is given command, and they take it away from the guy who actually knows what he's doing. [laughter] 
>> Seven nautical miles to the ship right now. 
>> Go forward? 
>> Yeah, push 'em all the way forward. 
>> All the way forward. Can't feel any power. Am I moving? 
>> Yup, we are. 
>> I want to go a little bit right, right? Now, just to be clear, I'm only steering this thing. The real professionals are doing the work of operating the navigation and the acceleration. But in true show business tradition, I'll take all the credit. [dramatic music] 
>> As we get a little farther out to sea, you'll feel the waves pick up a little bit. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Pretty heavy seas. I've driven monster trucks, fire trucks, even tanks, but that's child's play compared to trying to pilot this incredible machine. And believe me, folks, this is a lot harder than it looks. 
>> Congratulations on your first well deck. 
>> Hey, that was great, you guys. Very cool. Okay, so the Navy wasn't entirely comfortable with me docking a $40 million hovercraft. 
>> We're gonna shut down the main engines... 
>> Right. 
>> And then we'll get you off the boat. 
>> Cool. 
>> Maybe next time. 
>> Jay's on deck! 
>> Welcome aboard, Jay, to the USS Comstock. 
>> Thank you, sir. 
>> There you go. I got a fine, little hat for you. 
>> Oh, cool. 
>> That's yours. So you gotta wear it with pride. Oh, it fits perfect. 
>> There you go. 
>> Okay, so we're assembled on the flight deck. 
>> Cool. When I was a kid, I always enjoyed seeing Bob Hope standing on the ship with the golf club, saying hello to the men and women. And now I get to do it too. It's a real honor. 
>> I! 
>> all: Am a United States sailor. I will support and defend the constitution of the United States of America and I will obey the orders of those appointed over me. I represent the fighting spirit of the Navy and those who have gone before me to defend freedom and democracy around the world. I proudly serve my country's Navy Combat Team with honor, courage, and commitment. I am committed to excellence and the fair treatment of all. 
>> Booya! Hey, bring it in, please. Bring it in. Hey, it's a beautiful day onboard USS Comstock. And we have the privilege of having a special guest onboard. We all know him as the host of The Tonight Show and of Jay Leno's Garage. It's my privilege and honor to introduce to you Jay Leno. 
>> Thank you. Well, thank you, guys. Are we on? There we go. There we go, cool. This was really an honor, you guys. Thank you. It's really exciting to do. And we just want to show people what you guys do and how well you do it. And they let me drive it today. I see why they won't let me drive it again. [laughter] But anyway, I just want to say what an honor it is. And I'd like to be able to shake each and every one of you's hand if I could. I would like that privilege so much. So thank you. I'll give it back to the Captain. 
>> All right, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. 
>> Thank you. Thanks, guys. 
>> How's it going? 
>> Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. 
>> Can I get a-
- 
>> Thank you, sir. 
>> Did I get you? I missed you. 
>> You got me twice. 
>> Oh, I got you twice. Okay. 
>> Did him twice already. 
>> One, two... 
>> Say cheese. 
>> Thanks, everybody. 
>> Carry on, please. [applause]

>> My name is Sabrina Siek, and I'm the lead researcher at Ripley's Believe It or Not! They were here in beautiful Port Canaveral where the launches go off, the cruises go out, and you can go see a great view at the Exploration Tower. Behind me is another great view: Livio De Marchi's wooden Ferrari F50. The wooden Ferrari was created by Italian artist Livio De Marchi, who's from Venice, Italy and he started to create them for the Carnival of Venice. He would actually take them on the canals of Venice and make one every single year. He wanted to start making these cars, because he was bullied by some of other boats. He was in a wooden paddleboat, and he really needed to stand out. So, I mean, what better way than having a Ferrari F50 going down the canals? 
>> De Marchi is like a real, live Geppetto, using only hand tools to make his work truly come to life. 
>> So this car is the exact same dimensions of the Ferrari F50. In terms of weight, it's about 2,200 pounds, and the Ferrari F50 weighs 2,800 pounds. All the other details are almost spot-on, from the wheels to the air vents to the zippers behind the headrests, where the targa top would come off. 
>> A real Ferrari F50 goes over 200 miles an hour. This, not so much. 
>> [laughing] 
>> But that's okay, because you look cool driving it. 
>> Bon voyage. [laughing] [acoustic strumming] 
>> Okay, we've seen vehicles that travel on water. How about vehicles that pump water? Firefighting was pretty much the same from the 1840s of the 20th century. You had a horse-drawn wagon using massive horsepower to pull a steamer to pump the water. The part that changed dramatically was how you got to the fire. The horse-drawn carriage did improve response time, but by 1905, the idea of motorized fire engines started gaining popularity. And in 1922, the New York Fire Department finally retired their last horse-drawn engine. [bell dinging] [horses panting] Hey, Andy, how are you? 
>> Lovely. 
>> Come on down. One-time fireman and longtime friend Andy Swift has been restoring antique fire engines for years, and he's one of the best, if not the best, in the country. He works with everyone, from private collectors to museums, and that's why I brought him out here. 
>> Tell folks what we have here. 
>> What we got here is a 1914 Front Drive Christie tractor. 
>> Now, J. Walter Christie is kind of a hero of mine. He was not the first one to come up with a front-wheel drive vehicle, but one of the very first. And his engineering is really revolutionary. Since fire departments had so much of their equipment wrapped up in horse-drawn things, what he did was he enabled them to use their old horse-drawn steam engines and hook them up to-
- instead of horses, a front-wheel drive tractor. How much more economical was this versus a horse? 'Cause imagine, a horse you had to feed; you had veterinary bills and all that kind of thing. 
>> The fire department saved 90 cents on a dollar... 
>> Really? 
>> When the horses left the fire service. 
>> Okay. 
>> A lot of people say that was a bad time because, you know, the romance of firefighting went out the window when the horses left. 
>> Yeah, but they still put the fire out. [laughing] 'Cause the horses took a little longer to get there, didn't they? This could go 40 miles an hour. 
>> Exactly. Gas-burner versus hay-burner. 
>> Right, right. And this is where the expression of fighting fire with fire comes from, doesn't it? Because you have to light a fire in this, and sparks come out the top, so you can actually set a fire on your way to a fire, couldn't you? 
>> That's right. 
>> So how much maintenance was involved in this every day? 
>> You're gonna clean your flus. 
>> Right. 
>> You know, wire brush 'em, make sure that you--you get-
- 
>> You smell smoke? Look over that ridge. 
>> Whoa. 
>> Looks like there's something on fire. There's a fire. Look, I'll drive. 
>> Oh, nice. [dramatic music] Let's go. 
>> All right, so much for bad acting. Let's go put out a fire. [people screaming] [bell jangling] 
>> Hose. 
>> My end down? 
>> Yup. We're getting the suction on. We need it on there nice and tight. 
>> Now water's coming out of the pond, where... 
>> Check our fire again. And you think gas mileage is bad, wooden mileage is terrible. 
>> What we're doing is, we're heating up the water to make steam, which runs the pump, which will pull the water out of the lake. Andy, how we lookin'? 
>> We're looking good, Jay. We got plenty of water in the glass. We're generating steam right now, as that fire's going and then this throttle delivers the steam to the steam cylinders. 
>> Right. The pistons move up and down-
- that pushes the water. 
>> Exactly. And look at that, with five pounds on the gauge. 
>> You know, I see why a lot of houses burned down... 
>> Oh, come on. 
>> In the 1800s. 
>> This is a nice-
- 
>> Look, the house is on fire. We're standing here. 
>> Yeah, but you're putting out the fire. 
>> The house is on fire! 
>> Look how good you look while you're doing it! 
>> My house is on fire. Ow! And I'm getting covered with hot sparks. My beautiful-
- my only denim shirt, and it's getting a hole in it. Burn slower! We'll be there in about 20 minutes! We're building pressure! We'll be there in a little bit! Well, you get the idea. After a quick 20 minutes or so, we're ready to go. 
>> We're showing 25 pounds of steam, and it wants to take off. 
>> The slowest firemen in the world are ready to go put this thing out. Come on, let's get up there! 
>> Let's go! 
>> There we go. [popping] 
>> That's a little air. 
>> All right, let's advance that hose. 
>> You kind of get the idea how this works. We want to thank the Burbank Fire Department for putting up with all this nonsense. But you got to see how they fought fires over 100 years ago. The equipment wasn't as good, but the men are just as brave. So, guys, thank you very much. Thanks for being a part of it. I don't think we're gonna be on the calendar this year.

>> If you've never seen The Spy Who Loved Me, there's a villain trying to take over the world, Bond gets the girl, and there's a cool car. But not just any car, a 1977 Lotus Esprit. Oh, and it converts into a submarine, because... it's a Bond movie. 30 years later, Swiss automobile manufacturer Rinspeed took inspiration from James Bond and made the sQuba: a one-off concept car that literally turns into a submarine. Running on three electrical motors, it can go over 70 miles an hour on land and dive up to 35 feet in water. However, for safety reasons, there's no top. That's right, it's a convertible submarine, which doesn't make a lot of sense. But you want to be sure to bring a backup tuxedo. And did I mention it's fully autonomous? Leaving Bond's hands free to-
- [clears throat] Do other things. [jazzy music] Buckle up, folks. It's time to Assess & Caress with Donald Osborne. 
>> [Music] If you love classic cars [Music] [Music] Then Donald loves you [Music] 
>> Once again, I'm Assess. This is Caress. And we are going to discuss automobiles. This is, of course, Donald Osborne, our appraiser extraordinaire. He's brought three vehicles today. Decidedly a nautical theme. Tell us what we have. 
>> Well, Jay, we've got a 1944 Volkswagen Schwimmwagen. This a 1966 Amphicar 770, and a 1916 Crane-Simplex. Let's start with the Schwimmwagen. 
>> Okay. 
>> This is the amphibious version of the VW Bug... 
>> Right. 
>> Which of course was developed before World War II as the Kraft durch Freude Wagen. Like the U.S. Jeep, had a lot of military applications on land as the Kubelwagen. And this, the Schwimmwagen, the amphibious version of the car. 
>> Is this something that was just meant for swamps and wetlands, or can you actually cross a body of water in this thing? 
>> This is designed to go into the water and totally swim. 
>> Right. 
>> You notice that it has no doors. 
>> Right. 
>> The body is completely sealed underneath. The lights are mounted high. The exhaust pipe and muffler is mounted high. 
>> Well, show me how they engage the drive when you want to go in the water. 
>> Okay, so the way it's explained to me, the person in the backseat... 
>> Schultzy. 
>> Handling this--Schultzy. 
>> I see nothing! 
>> I see nothing. He hooks this up. He then pushes down, and the weight of the propeller connects it with the driveshaft, and you're off and running. 
>> And is it the standard Volkswagen engine, 4-cylinder? 
>> The standard Volkswagen 4-cylinder engine. 
>> Okay. 
>> Exactly, as did the first post-war VW. For something completely different, let's take a look at the 1916 Crane-Simplex. 
>> Well, I know a little something about this one, 'cause it's my car. Holbrook was the body-builder, and Crane-Simplex was meant to be an American Rolls-Royce. The thing that makes this one interesting was, they built really big, boxy, boring limousines. So this is a one-off car that was built specifically just to display the, Look, we don't just build boring limousines. 
>> Exactly. 
>> As you see, all sorts of bits of brass and copper. I mean, this is when an engine looked like an engine. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> I mean, this carburetor looks like a toilet bowl. 
>> [laughing] 
>> It's just a huge, enormous-
- and really, it's--every time you step on the gas, it's like flushing seven gallons. 
>> And it's also very emblematic of the period when your chauffeur had a lot of work to do after he dropped you off at home to keep all of this cleaned and polished and functioning... 
>> Right. 
>> Exactly the way it should. Let's turn to the Amphicar. 
>> I remember these when they came out, 'cause it was such a ridiculous concept. But it actually works quite well. You can't help but smile when you drive this thing. 
>> The Amphicar is an astonishing thing. And, of course, the car, which was made in only one series, was called the Model 770. And the 770 stood for seven knots in the water, 70 miles per hour on land... 
>> Oh, okay. 
>> Each equally scary. Powered by a 4-cylinder Triumph engine, putting out close to 43 horsepower. They ended up making somewhere under 10,000 units for the entire production run. 
>> And in the United States, you have to license it as both a car and a boat. 
>> Thereby doubling your expenses... 
>> Yeah. 
>> Doubling your insurance. So it really is for people who have to have something by their lake house that they could only use there. And the ones that survived also were used very little. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> Once the novelty wore off, I think most of them were just sort of parked in garages. 
>> Okay, there we have our three nautically-themed cars. But investment-wise, which one has the best potential? If you bought one of these five years ago, would you be underwater, as Donald would say? We'll find out. 
>> I will reveal all. 
>> This and more after a brief message from our sponsors. [uplifting music] 
>> Here comes a dark cloud on the horizon for anyone who runs a toll bridge for a living: the Amphicar, a new, imported model, which is just about at home in the water as it is on the highway. The same power plant and the same controls make it a cinch to operate, and twin props send it through the water at a brisk clip. It could be a wonderful way to bypass traffic jams, but imagine a rear-end collision in 40 fathoms of water.

>> With great style. 
>> With great style--certainly better style than either of these. All right, which one do you want to start with? 
>> Well, Jay, let's start with the Amphicar. 
>> Okay. 
>> Five years ago, one of these cars could have been purchased for about $55,000. And today, you'd pay about $75,000. 
>> That high, huh? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Okay. 
>> Now let's go to the Schwimmwagen. Because of their rarity, and because of the interest they've always been very valuable. Five years ago, one of these would have been about $150,000. 
>> Wow, okay. 
>> And today, $185,000 would not be out of the question. 
>> Wow, I didn't think it was anywhere near that. Okay. Well, let's go over to my baby, the Crane-Simplex. 
>> One of these, about five years ago, would have cost about $150,000. Today, it would cost about $225,000. 
>> Okay. 
>> So the winner of our five-year appreciation sweepstakes... 
>> Ah, okay. 
>> The Crane-Simplex. 
>> Well, I finally won one of these. Thank you. 
>> Congratulations, sir. 
>> Man, it took two seasons. 
>> Can't rush into these things. 
>> Jeez. 
>> [laughing] [energetic music] 
>> Okay, I'm sliding around. The car I'm driving right now is a 2016 Mustang GT. It's got the five-liter engine. It's got a six-speed, manual gearbox. It's got the Track Pack, with better handling and control. A traction control is a system that helps limit tire slip on slippery surfaces. On most modern cars, it's an option you can turn on or off. I feel the car sliding under me. As you can see, I don't have it on right now. [engine revving] Now, traction control doesn't mean you won't slip. It just limits the amount of slipping you do. Sometimes it's fun to go old school, and that's exactly what we're doing today. Fun hanging the tail end out like this. I think I like the traction control off. Now, to show you how water can affect car performance, we set up a little figure-eight wet course with NBC executives we have to avoid. 'Cause there's nothing like a good contest, I've challenged my old buddy Alonzo Bodden to an old-fashioned traction-off race. Hey, Alonzo. 
>> How you doing, Jay? 
>> Good seeing you. Now, a simple wet course is child's play, and since Alonzo and I are pretty experienced drivers, I thought we'd make things a little more challenging. I tell you what we're gonna do. We want to show you what it's like to drive while impaired. Now, the folks at Ford have created this drunk driving suit: goggles to blur the vision and body weight that mimics the effect of being under the influence of alcohol. And guess what. We're gonna put it on. Jim, come on in. Now, what is your title? What do you do? 
>> I'm the manager of Ford's Driving Skills for Life program. 
>> Okay, so you teach young kids about the dangers of driving impaired. 
>> Impaired, distracted--also teach them 'em advanced driving skills they didn't learn in Driver's Ed. But impaired driving's extremely important. 
>> Let's bring in the drunk driving suit. 
>> Come on in, Nolan. 
>> What do we have here? 
>> Nolan will put goggles on him that simulate the... 
>> Let's start with these goggles. 
>> Okay. 
>> Now let's put some weights down on your ankles. 
>> You do what you got to do, my friend. Have you put these on, Jay? 'Cause I'm not sure where you went. [laughing] 
>> And how many drinks are we talking about here? 
>> Well, .08 is typically around four in an hour if--beers, for example. 
>> Four drinks in an hour. 
>> Four beers in an hour. 
>> All right. 
>> You are suited up. 
>> Flexibility's thrown off a little bit there. So now you're all set. 
>> Okay. 
>> Now, in real life, Alonzo and I don't drink at all, so this should be interesting. 
>> All right, let's do it. 
>> I'm getting out of the way. 
>> I'm good. These are heavily insured, I'm guessing. 
>> Good guess. 
>> [laughing] We're ready to go. 
>> I'm here with Deputy Sheriff RJ. He's hosing down the track and hitting Alonzo with some water. Let's see what happens. 
>> Hey, tell the officer I'm a close, personal friend of Jay Leno in case there's any trouble. [upbeat music] Wow. Really? 
>> And go. Okay, moving very cautiously. Okay, I think he's--I think he-
- he went outside the, uh... [buzzer] Okay, this is not good. 
>> I'm seeing a lot of cones. 
>> Well, he hasn't hit 
>> Well, he hasn't hit anything yet. Okay, maybe the idea of traction control really doesn't work when you're only going two miles an hour. 
>> I don't know where the course went. 
>> He's not even on the track now. [buzzer] He appears to be lost. [laughing] Okay, ran over a cone. [buzzer] 
>> Hey, there's something wrong with this car--not me. I'm fine. I'm gonna try this direction. I'm gonna try this direction. I'm between cones. I don't know which ones. [laughing] 
>> Okay, I'm gonna see if I can find him. 
>> I think I won. 
>> How do you think you did? 
>> Fantastic. It looks like everything's still standing. 
>> That's 'cause you weren't on the course at all. 
>> All right, Jay, Mr. Expert Driver, Mr. This Is My Show, how about you give it a shot? 
>> I'll give it a shot. 
>> Yeah, yeah. You try the helmet and the goggles and the clown. 
>> I can't see anything. 
>> [laughing] Give him a little more water. There you go. Three, two, one. Jay Leno, professional driver. Boom. [buzzer] We didn't need that cone, did we? 
>> [chuckling] 
>> You know, from the way he does this, I think he might drink and drive on a regular basis. He's actually pretty good. [buzzer] Well, I may have spoke too soon. [laughs] 
>> No sure where I'm going here. 
>> Yeah. Now he's speeding it up. [tires squealing] Now he's working. [tires squealing] Oh, Officer, did you see that? That can't be legal. 
>> Okay, I mean, this is about as dangerous as it gets. [engine roaring] 
>> So, Officer, if you saw a man driving like that, how quickly would you pull him over? 
>> Pretty quickly. Well, Jay, I'm gonna have to say I'm impressed. You drove half the course in half the time. So I'm not sure if that's a win or not. 
>> I don't know. Boy, this is... 
>> This is really scary to think people are this impaired when they're driving. 
>> I can't even imagine. 
>> I mean... 
>> It's unbelievable. I tell you, I need you a drink. 
>> This is scary. 
>> I mean, these are amazing driver aids-
- traction control, stability control, but it's still up to the driver, isn't it? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You only do so much. 
>> None of that equipment that's put in the cars helps if you're drunk. 
>> Right. 
>> Don't do it. 
>> Don't be Alonzo. 
>> Jay Leno is a very impressive drunk driver. However, I have superior drunk basketball skills. 
>> [laughing]

Basically, without getting too technical, it runs on a battery powered by two tanks, a negative and a positive, filled with ionic liquids-
- salt water. The reaction creates electricity, which powers the car. Now, to be clear, you can't just dump in some seawater. These are highly sophisticated electrolyte fluids. It has zero emissions, and unlike an electric car, it refuels much like you would an ordinary car. Now, the technology is fascinating and has a ton of potential, yet most experts are still a bit skeptical. Still, the car is impressive. Modern and sleek with gull wing doors, the QUANT E delivers 920 horsepower, has a top speed of 218 miles per hour, and can go 370 miles on a single charge. However, these claims are unconfirmed, so you might want to take it with a grain of salt. [upbeat music] This is what I love about California: we're just about an hour from my garage where it was 80 degrees, and now I'm up to my wheels in snow.
