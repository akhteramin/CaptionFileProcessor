But mania, such as unusual changes in your mood, activity or energy levels, can leave you on... shaky ground. Help take control by asking your healthcare provider about VRAYLAR. VRAYLAR treats acute mania of bipolar I disorder. VRAYLAR significantly reduces overall manic symptoms, and was proven in adults with mixed episodes who have both mania and depression. VRAYLAR should not be used in elderly patients with dementia, due to increased risk of death or stroke. Call your doctor about fever, stiff muscles, or confusion, which may mean a life-threatening reaction or uncontrollable muscle movements, which may be permanent. Side effects may not appear for several weeks. High cholesterol and weight gain; high blood sugar, which can lead to coma or death; decreased white blood cells, which can be fatal; dizziness upon standing; falls; seizures; impaired judgement; heat sensitivity; and trouble swallowing may occur. You're more than just your bipolar I. People everywhereVRAYLAR. are confusing Quilted Northern for robes. They're both cushiony, comforting, and add elegance to your home.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JARDIANCE asked: When it comes to managing your type 2 diabetes, what matters to you? Let's see. Most of you say lower A1C. But only a few of you are thinking about your heart. Fact is, even though it helps to manage A1C, type 2 diabetes still increases your risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke. JARDIANCE is the first type 2 diabetes pill with a lifesaving cardiovascular benefit for adults who have type 2 diabetes and heart disease, JARDIANCE significantly reduces the risk of dying from a cardiovascular event and lowers A1C, with diet and exercise. Let's give it another try. <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i> <i> serious side effects</i> <i> including dehydration.</i> <i> This may cause you</i> <i> to feel dizzy, faint,</i> <i> or lightheaded,</i> <i> or weak upon standing.</i> <i> Ketoacidosis</i> <i> is a serious side effect</i> <i> that may be fatal.</i> <i> Symptoms include nausea,</i> <i> vomiting, stomach pain,</i> <i> tiredness,</i> <i> and trouble breathing.</i> <i> A rare but life-threatening</i> <i> bacterial infection</i> <i> in the skin of the genital</i> <i> area could also occur.</i> <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> and call your doctor right away</i> <i> if you have symptoms</i> <i> of this bacterial infection,</i> <i> ketoacidosis</i> <i> or an allergic reaction.</i> <i> Symptoms of an allergic</i> <i> reaction include rash,</i> <i> swelling, and difficulty</i> <i> breathing or swallowing.</i> <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i> <i> if you are on dialysis</i> <i> or have severe kidney problems.</i> <i> Other side effects are</i> <i> sudden kidney problems,</i> <i> genital yeast infections,</i> <i> increased bad cholesterol,</i> <i> and urinary tract infections,</i> <i> which may be serious.</i> <i> Taking JARDIANCE with</i> <i> a sulfonylurea or insulin</i> <i> may cause low blood sugar.</i> <i> Tell your doctor about</i> <i> all the medicines you take</i> <i> and if you have any</i> <i> medical conditions.</i> Isn't it time to rethink your type 2 diabetes medication? Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE and get to the heart of what matters. Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE <i>Think only specialty stores have</i> <i>what's new?</i> <i> Olay has this season's hottest</i> <i> debut.</i> <i> Like new Clay Stick Masks.</i> <i> All Mask, No Mess.</i> <i> Olay Hydrating Facial Mist.</i> <i> For hydration on the go.</i> <i>And our breakthrough Brightening</i> <i>Eye Cream.</i> <i> Boosted with Vitamin C.</i> <i> Get your new beauty fix.</i> <i> Only by Olay.</i> I work hard to protect this Tookus. To take care of any messy situations. And put irritation in its place. And if I can get comfortable keeping this Tookus safe and protected... you can get comfortable doing the same with yours.
