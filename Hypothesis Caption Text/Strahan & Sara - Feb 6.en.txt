 HI, YOU GUYS. COMING UP ON THE SHOW TODAY,
 "REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY
 HILLS" STAR KYLE RICHARDS IS
 HERE.
 AND MAGICIAN ROB LAKE.
 YES, AND WE HAVE A BOWLING
 PIG.
 PIGGY.
 I SAID IT, AND WE HAVE THE
 GREATEST AUDIENCE IN TELEVISION.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 FROM THE CROSS ROADS OF THE
 WORLD, TIMES SQUARE, NEW YORK
 CITY, IT'S "STRAHAN AND SARA."
 ESCAPE FOR AN HOUR.
 WE ALL NEED IT.

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YO, YO, YO, YO.
 HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, EVERYBODY.
 HOW YOU DOING, SARA HAINES?
 I'LL BEGIN IN A SECOND.
 I THINK IT'S ON.
 IT'S ON?
 THERE WE GO.
 KEEP IT GOING.
 MAMA LIKEY.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PICKED
 THAT CHAIR YESTERDAY.
 I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
 SOMETIMES I NEED A PEDICURE
 JUST TO GET INTO THE CHAIR.
 DAYS ARE ROUGH SOMETIMES.
 DAYS ARE ROUGH SOMETIMES, BUT
 SPEAKING OF ROUGH DAYS, I SAW
 THIS CLIP LAST NIGHT, OKAY?
 IT IS AN EXPLOSIVE INTERVIEW.
 IT WAS GIVEN ON MORNING
 TELEVISION IN AUSTRALIA.
 OKAY.
 AND I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.
 YOU GUYS -I'M GLAD YOU'RE
 SITTING DOWN.
 BUCKLE UP.
 BUCKLE UP BECAUSE -GET READY
 FOR THIS.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
 MICHAEL BOLTON JOINS US LIVE
 FROM FLORIDA.
 GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME BACK TO
 THE SHOW.
 MICHAEL, YOU GOT US OKAY?
 MAYBE HE'S JUST ON INSTAGRAM.
 HI, MICHAEL.
 WE'RE WITH YOU LIVE.
 IT'S GONE SILENT.
 MICHAEL, CAN YOU HEAR US
 AFTER SUCH A GREAT INTRO?
 WE DON'T WANT TO WASTE --
 MICHAEL BOLTON, LIVE IN FLORIDA.
 CAN YOU HEAR US?
 DID YOU HEAR HIM?
 HE GOES, IT'S GONE SILENT.
 IT'S, LIKE, HE'S LISTENING TO
 HIS OWN MUSIC.
 I LOVE ME SOME MICHAEL BOLTON,
 BUT THAT STUFF IS SOOTHING.
 THEY TRIED TO SAY IT WAS A
 TECHNICAL GLITCH.
 HOW DO YOU SAVE THAT ONE?
 THERE'S NO WAY OF SAVING THAT
 ONE.
 YOU CAN'T COME BACK.
 MY MAN WAS TIRED.
 WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
 I LOVE MICHAEL BOLTON.
 I DO TOO.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 YOU ALSO KNOW THAT I LOVE A GOOD
 NETFLIX BINGE.
 I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE
 DOCUMENTARY
 SERIES "CONVERSATIONS WITH A
 KILLER: THE TED BUNDY TAPES",
 AND THE CENTER SEEMED TO NOTE
 SOMETHING ABOUT THE THE FAMED
 SERIAL KILLER WHICH I THINK WAS
 NOTABLE AT THE TIME.
 HE IS A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.
 TITAN HAS PAID $9 MILLION TO
 ACQUIRE THE RIGHTS TO THE
 FILM, "EXTREMELY WICKED,
 SHOCKINGLY VIOLENT AND EVIL."
 THIS IS A BIOPIC STARRING ZAC
 EF
 EFRON WHO IS ALSO GOOD LOOKING.
 NETFLIX TWEETED, I HAVE SEEN A
 LOT OF TALK ABOUT TED BUNDY'S
 ALLEGED HOTNESS, AND WOULD LIKE
 TO GENTLY REMIND EVERYONE THAT
 THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF
 HOT MEN ON THE SERVICE, ALMOST
 ALL OF WHOM ARE NOT CONVICTED
 SERIAL KILLERS.
 TRUE.
 THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
 IT RAISES A GOOD CONVERSATION
 FLOATING AROUND THE INTERNET
 RIGHT NOW.
 ARE WE ROMANTICIZING TED BUNDY?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 WELL, NO.
 YOU CAN SAY HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING
 GUY, BUT BEING A GOOD-LOOKING
 GUY IS THE REASON HE GOT AWAY
 WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING FOR SO
 LONG.
 IF YOU ARE DOING A STORY ABOUT
 TED BUNDY, YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN
 THE MOST ACCURATE WAY AS
 POSSIBLE.
 IT WAS MADE SO PEOPLE CAN BE
 AWARE THAT THERE IS MORE THAN
 ONE LOOK TO A SERIAL KILLER.
 YEAH, AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
 ASIDE FROM HIM USING THAT AT THE
 TIME, WE HADN'T SEEN SERIAL
 KILLERS AT ALL, AND PEOPLE
 AUTOMATICALLY ASSOCIATED A
 CERTAIN LOOK WITH WHAT A
 CRIMINAL WAS.
 SO WITHOUT THIS ELEMENT OF THE
 STORY, YOU WOULD BE BETRAYING
 THE WHOLE STORY.
 SO I DON'T THINK IT'S MAKING IT
 ROMANTIC BY SEEING THESE TAPES
 BY THE WAY.
 THE MOVIE IS NOT OUT YET.
 THE TAPES MAKE HIM A VILE
 CREATURE.
 NOTHING ABOUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT
 HIM IS GOOD-LOOKING.
 IT'S, LIKE, A BAD DATE WHERE THE
 GUY IS REALLY HOT AND HE'S,
 LIKE -WHEN I WATCH TED BUNDY,
 I SEE DEATH AND EVIL IN HIS EYES
 AND THERE IS NOTHING
 GOOD-LOOKING ABOUT THAT.
 WHEN HE'S UP ON TRIAL FOR
 SERIAL KILLING, ALL THESE
 WOMEN --
 YEAH.
 WERE STILL COMING TO SEE HIM
 AND WRITING HIM LETTERS AND I
 DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
 WELL, THAT'S A UNIQUE
 PSYCHOLOGY.
 YOU SEE THAT WITH A LOT OF
 PEOPLE.
 YOU SEE IT WITH R. KELLY
 ACTUALLY.
 WOMEN THAT SHOW UP AT COURT.
 TRUE.
 THERE IS A STRAIN OF WOMEN
 THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT
 NEEDS TO BE STUDIED THERE, BUT
 THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF
 THE SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
 MAMA SHOPS ELSEWHERE FOR HER
 MEN, OKAY?
 SO WE GOT THE TED -WE NEED
 ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY CALLED "WHAT
 THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?"
 NEXT YEAR.
 NEXT YEAR.
 NEXT YEAR'S DOCUMENTARY.
 OKAY.
 YOU KNOW -I LOVE HAWAII.
 DO YOU LOVE HAWAII?
 OH, YES.
 ALOHA.
 RIGHT?
 BUT YOU MAY NOT IF YOU ARE A
 SMOKER BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW
 BILL THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED BY
 LAWMAKERS IN HAWAII THAT COULD
 RAISE THE LEGAL SMOKING AGE FROM
 21 TO 100.
 YES.
 SO ALL TEN PEOPLE THAT TURNED
 100 CAN SMOKE IN HAWAII.
 THERE IS A DIFFERENT CREDIT.
 HIS NAME IS RICHARD KRIEGEN AND
 HE USED TO BE AN EMERGENCY ROOM
 PHYSICIAN.
 BEFORE HE BECAME ELECTED STATE
 REPRESENTATIVE AND HE IS SAYING
 IT'S THE DEADLIEST ARTIFACT IN
 HUMAN HISTORY, SMOKING IS.
 HE WANTS TO CHANGE IT FROM 21 TO
 100 BECAUSE NICOTINE IS AS
 ADDICTIVE AS HEROIN.
 SAY THAT AGAIN.
 IT IS AS ADDICTIVE AS HEROIN.
 HE'S WORRIED ABOUT THAT, AND DO
 YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR THE
 GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO TELL
 YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR BODY
 WHEN YOU ARE OVER 21?
 IN MOST INSTANCES, NO.
 WHEN IT COMES TO, LIKE, SODA
 BANS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, STAY
 OUT OF MY HOUSE.
 I DON'T THINK HEROIN SHOULD BE
 LEGAL.
 I DON'T THINK SMOKING SHOULD BE
 LEGAL.
 I ACTUALLY AM OKAY WITH --
 BECAUSE I DON'T THINK TAXING
 HELPS BECAUSE IT'S AN ADDICTION
 AND AN ILLNESS.
 YOU'RE MONETIZING SOMEONE'S
 SICKNESS.
 WE SHOULD NOT MAKE MONEY OFF OF
 IT BY SAYING WE DON'T APPROVE OF
 THIS.
 IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS FOR YOU.
 I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD
 STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
 I'M MOVING TO HAWAII.
 BUT I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IF
 I'M OVER -I'M 21 AND OVER, I
 SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WHAT I WANT
 TO DO.
 I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO BE 88
 YEARS OLD AND I'M GOING TO THE
 GROCERY STORE.
 CAN I GET A PACK OF SMOKES?
 AND THEY CARD ME.
 I'M 88.
 88-YEAR-OLD MAN GETTING CARDED
 FOR CIGARETTES?
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
 IF YOU SMOKE, YOU'LL BE LUCKY
 TO MAKE IT TO 88, AND I DON'T
 THINK SHE SHOULD BE -I DON'T
 THINK CIGARETTES SHOULD BE SOLD
 NEXT TO THE SKITTLES.
 I JUST DON'T.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THAT'S ME TAPPING YOU OUT.
 A LITTLE MOVE ON.
 OF ALL THE THINGS, YOU PICK
 ON THE SKITTLES.
 GIRL, LEAVE THE SKITTLES ALONE.
 I LOVE SKITTLES.
 I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET TO THIS
 STORY.
 YOU'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
 DID YOU HEAR THIS?
 I'M A KING.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 MICHAEL.
 MICHAEL.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED TO
 ADDRESS ME AS KING MICHAEL, BUT
 DID YOU WATCH THE SEGMENT ON
 ANCESTRY, "GOOD MORNING AMERICA"
 YESTERDAY?
 YOU'RE ON, LIKE, 58 SHOWS.
 THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH HOURS IN
 THE DAY.
 I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THAT ONE.
 I WATCH ALL YOUR SHOWS.
 I'M ON ONE SHOW, AND I SIT
 THREE FEET FROM YOU.
 YOU BETTER BE WATCHING.
 WHATEVER.
 BUT ANYWAY, ALL I KNOW IS THAT
 RENOWNED HISTORIC PROFESSOR
 HENRY LOUIS GATES JR., HE TRACED
 MY LINEAGE BACK THROUGH THE
 CENTURIES.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 WHEN WE TRACED MY LINEAGE
 EVEN FURTHER BACK -I'M A KING,
 Y'ALL.
 CHARLAMAGNE IS YOUR 39th
 GREAT GRANDFATHER.
 WHAT?
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 YES.
 THAT'S RIGHT, BABY THAT'S
 RIGHT.
 I AM A DESCENDENT OF
 CHARLAMAGNE.
 YES.
 NO.
 NOT THAT CHARLAMAGNE.
 THE OTHER ONE.
 THE OTHER CHARLAMAGNE.
 YES, THE KING OF THE FRANKS.
 THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE.
 WHAT'S UP, GREAT GRANDPA?
 HOLLER AT ME.
 YOU CAN JUST CALL ME KING
 STRAHAN.
 MICHAEL, ONE, I HAVE
 CELEBRATED HALLOWEEN AS WELL.
 TWO, THIS IS NOT A MONARCHY,
 OKAY?
 WE DO NOT LIVE IN A MONARCHY.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IF
 YOU HAVE ONE DROP OF ROYAL BLOOD
 FLOWING THROUGH YOUR VEINS LIKE
 I DO, YOU'RE A KING.
 YOU'RE A KING.

 I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW IT
 WORKS.
 THEY GREW UP IN GERMANY.
 DOES THAT MAKE ME THE RIGHTFUL
 KING OF GERMANY?
 RORY.

 YEAH, MICHAEL?
 I MEAN, MY LIEGE?
 THAT'S BETTER.
 RORY, CALL ANGELA MERKEL.
 I WANT THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO
 GO AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE,
 OKAY?
 I'M TAKING OVER.
 YOU KNOW, I LOVE YOU MORE
 THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.
 YOU'RE NOT A KING.
 I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.
 IF I'M NOT A KING, EXPLAIN THIS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WHY DO YOU DO THIS, YOU GUYS?
 YOU'RE FEEDING IT.
 THAT IS SAL.
 HE'S ONE OF OUR STAGE HANDS.
 HE LITERALLY -IT'S HIS JOB TO
 HAND YOU THINGS.
 HE ONLY DID IT BECAUSE I'M
 KING.
 HE WOULD DO IT FOR ME IF I
 ASKED.
 SHE'S RIGHT, MR. KING
 STRAHAN.
 SHE'S RIGHT.
 BACK TO THE DUNGEON.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 POOR SAL.
 WOULD YOU MIND TASTING THAT?
 NO.
 MICHAEL, NO ONE'S POISONING YOU.
 MY ENEMIES.
 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ENEMIES.
 EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.
 OTHER SHOWS ARE ENEMIES.
 LIKE "THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH
 JIMMY FALLON."
 "THE TONIGHT SHOW" ISN'T EVEN
 ON THE SAME TIME WE ARE.
 I BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO LAY
 SEED TO THE CLAN OF THE 30 ROCK.
 I HEREBY DECLARE WAR ON "THE
 TONIGHT SHOW."
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
 TWO CAN PLAY AT THIS GAME.
 I MAY NOT COME FROM ROYAL BLOOD,
 BUT I DECLARE MY -WINTER IS
 COMING.
 ♪ DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN ♪
 I DECLARE MYSELF QUEEN WITH MY
 DRAGONS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THE KING HAS CHOSEN TO END
 THIS SEGMENT.
 THAT IS RIGHT.
 COMING UP, WE HAVE GOT A PIG
 THAT BOWLS.
 THIS PLEASES THE KING.
 BRING ON THE PIG.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
        I tell everyone to     take the AncestryDNA test
          if you want to       get the most details
            about your          family history.
 My pie chart showed that I'm from all over Europe,
            but then it        got super specific.
           I learned my         people came from
             a small         region in Poland
        and even a little        bit of the history
 about why they might have migrated during that time.
          Those migration         patterns are more
             than just          lines on a map,
          they're really       your family's story.
     I can't wait to see what    I'm going to discover next.

            I use this            every day
        <i> But is Beth's soap</i>
    <i> as clean rinsing as Dove?</i>
     My soap's still leaving
     plenty of things behind
   But Dove is cleaner rinsing
             My soap,
             ...Dove.
          <i> Made with 1/4</i>      <i> moisturizing cream...</i>

 SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT ABOUT
 YOU.
 MY HAIR.
 I GOT IT TRIMMED.
 YOU'RE SO CUTE.
 MAX DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
 NO.
 IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR HAIR.
 YOU GOT A NEW CHAIR.
 YOU'RE SO HIGH UP.
 I SHOULD HAVE GOT A NEW CHAIR.
 IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SIZE OF
 THE CHAIR, MICHAEL.
 ANYWAY.
 THIS WEEK, LOOK WHO'S HANGING
 HERE.
 IT'S WILL ARNETT.
 YES.
 DON'T WE JUST WANT TO HAVE SOME
 FUN?
 "STRAHAN AND SARA."
 WE GOT IT ALL.
 LUNCHTIME AT 1:00 EASTERN,
 12:00 CENTRAL AND PACIFIC RIGHT
 HERE ON ABC.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.
 AND YES, YOU HAVE GOT TO ADJUST
 YOUR TELEVISIONS.
 WE ARE HOLDING PIGS BECAUSE WE
 WANTED TO CELEBRATE THE CHINESE
 NEW YEAR WHICH IS THE YEAR OF
 THE PIG.
 JOINING US IS ANIMAL TRAINER
 GRANT KIMMERER.
 HEY.
 HEY, GRANT.
 GLAD TO BE HERE.
 ONE OF THEM POOPED.
 WAS THAT YOURS OR MINE?
 MINE.
 THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT.
 SPOILER ALERT.
 THERE IS A PIG THAT BOWLS
 THOUGH.
 I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THAT.

 AND I HAVE GOT SO SAY,
 USUALLY THE WAY I'M HOLDING THE
 PIG IS HOW I HOLD A FOOTBALL.
 SO I APOLOGIZE.
 AND THIS PIG IS GETTING ME BACK
 BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM BOTH
 ENDS ALL OVER ME.
 SO WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS --
 THIS NICE LITTLE FELLOW?
 YOU'RE HOLDING POLLY.
 POLLY.
 THAT IS JANET.
 JANET.

 YOU NAMED THIS PIG JANET?
 SURE.
 PIGS NEED NAMES.
 PIGS NEED NAMES, YEAH.
 THIS IS A 2-MONTH-OLD AND A
 4-MONTH-OLD KUNEKUNE PIG AND IT
 IS A NEW ZEALAND BREED OF
 DOM
 DOMESTICATED PIG THAT TRANSLATES
 TO ROUND AND FAT.
 THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS?
 QUITE APPROPRIATE.
 THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.
 ARE PIGS SAFE TO HAVE?
 MILEY CYRUS HAS ONE.
 ARIANA GRANDE HAS ONE.
 NOW MICHAEL AND I HAVE ONE.
 THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY SAFE, BUT
 AS FAR AS BEING A GOOD PET,
 THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.
 DO THEY BITE?
 THERE ARE SOME TEETH ON THIS
 LITTLE --
 ABSOLUTELY THEY CAN BITE.
 THEY ARE BORN WITH A FULL SET OF
 TEETH AND THEY WILL BITE EACH
 OTHER.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, BUT THE
 THING ABOUT PIGS AS A PET, YOU
 KNOW, LIKE ANY PET, YOU NEED TO
 BE EMPATHETIC.
 YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH
 THE ANIMAL'S NEEDS AND YOU DON'T
 WANT TO JUST GET ONE ON A WHIM
 AND WIND UP NOT WANTING IT.
 GETTING RID OF IT,
 IT'S NOT A GOOD LIFE FOR THE
 ANIMAL.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE GET PIGS AND
 REALIZE WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF
 IT.
 PETS IN GENERAL.
 LET'S GO TO THE NEW
 SMITHSONIAN CHANNEL DOCUMENTARY.
 TRYING TO TAKE MY READ HERE.
 IT'S COMING OUT SOON.
 IT'S CALLED "AMAZING PIGS," AND
 WHAT'S THE ONE THING YOU
 LEARNED --
 IN THE BAHAMAS, I FED THOSE.
 WHAT'S THE ONE THING THAT
 BLEW YOUR MIND?
 EXACTLY.
 THE PIGS IN THE BAHAMAS.
 ANY FOUR-LEGGED MAMMAL CAN SWIM,
 BUT THEY DOGGY PADDLE.
 SLOTHS CAN SWIM.
 BUT THESE PIGS IN THE BAHAMAS,
 15, 20 FEET OF WATER.
 THEY'RE PADDLING AROUND.
 THEY COME AT YOU.
 THEY'RE SMART, AND THEY LEARN
 WITH THESE BOATS AND TWO-LEGGED
 CREATURES AND IT MEANS FOOD.
 THEY SWIM RIGHT OUT TO GET IT.
 IT'S PHENOMENAL.
 THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER EVERY
 CONTINENT ON THE PLANET OTHER
 THAN ANTARCTICA.
 PIG BOWLING, MAN.
 YOU PROMISED US SOME PIG
 BOWLING.
 YES.
 WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUT THE
 WILD BOAR OF THE BOWLING -FROM

 KNOW, --
 THAT'S THE LITTLE ONE?
 THEY GROW TO BE MUCH LARGER
 THAN WHAT YOU WOULD SUSPECT.
 KEEP IN MIND.
 HAMMY CAN GET 100 TO EVEN 200
 POUNDS.
 WHAT IS HAMMY RIGHT NOW?
 HE'S A SOLID 25 POUNDS.
 SO A LOT OF GROWTH.
 A LOT MORE GROWTH.
 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
 HE PULLED A HAMSTRING IN
 REHEARSAL SO WE'LL MAKE IT A
 LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR HIM.
 HE'S A MUCH LIGHTER ONE.
 YOU SAY HE WAS PUSHING JUST
 FROM THE OTHER END.

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

            Hi Susan!
      Honey? I respect that.
       But that cough looks          pretty bad...
  try this NEW Robitussin Honey.
    <i> The real honey you love...</i>
     <i> Plus the powerful cough</i>         <i> relief you need.</i>
      Mind if I root through           your trash?
      <i> New Robitussin Honey.</i>
 <i>Because it's never just a cough.</i>
        Mascara in a snap.
        New Snapscara from       Maybelline New York.

  Pure pigment formula means...

         No raccoon eyes.

          This is nice.
              Yeah.
       Yeah, this is nice.
    Mmmm how did you make the     dip so rich and creamy?
     Oh, it's a Philadelphia-

          Can I see it?
               No.

             <i> So good,</i>
   <i> you'll take all the credit.</i>
      I've always been amazed          by what's next.
   And still going for my best,
      even though I live with      a higher risk of stroke
     due to Afib not caused by      a heart valve problem.
 So if there's a better treatment         than warfarin...
         I want that too.
             ELIQUIS.
         ELIQUIS is proven
       to reduce stroke risk       better than warfarin.
    Plus has significantly less
   major bleeding than warfarin.
      ELIQUIS is FDA-approved           and has both.
           What's next?
      Reeling in a nice one.
    <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i>
 <i>as stopping increases your risk</i>       <i> of having a stroke.</i>
  <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i>  <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i>
  <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i>    <i> an artificial heart valve</i>
      <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>
      <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>    <i> you may bruise more easily</i>
   <i> and it may take longer than</i> <i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i>
   <i> Seek immediate medical care</i>   <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i>
      <i> like unusual bruising.</i>
    <i> ELIQUIS may increase your</i>          <i> bleeding risk</i>
  <i> if you take certain medicines.</i>
         <i> Tell your doctor</i>    <i> about all planned medical</i>
      <i> or dental procedures.</i>
      ELIQUIS, the number one
      cardiologist-prescribed          blood thinner.
    Ask your doctor if ELIQUIS
      is what's next for you.
    <i> You might take something</i>       <i> for your heart...</i>
           <i> or joints.</i>
    <i> But do you take something</i>         <i> for your brain.</i>
  <i> With an ingredient originally</i>    <i> discovered in jellyfish,</i>
     <i> Prevagen has been shown</i>       <i> in clinical trials</i>
  <i> to improve short-term memory.</i>
   <i> Prevagen. Healthier Brain.</i>          <i> Better Life.</i>
       I'm a close talker.
  So I was excited about All-New  Colgate Total.
  Its breakthrough formula does  more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
     I like your confidence.
         Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.

 PLEASE WELCOME OUR NEXT GUEST

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 HI.

 HOW ARE YOU?
 GREAT TO SEE YOU.
 HOW YOU DOING?
 GREAT.
 HOW ARE YOU?
 WHERE ARE WE GOING?
 HAVE A SEAT.
 I ALMOST FELT BAD HUGGING HER
 BECAUSE WE JUST HELD PIGS.
 I WANTED TO HOLD A PIG.
 THE BEVERLY HILLS AIR KISS.
 YEAH.
 I LOVE THOSE LITTLE PIGS.
 I WANTED TO FEED ONE FROM A
 BOTTLE.
 I DON'T WANT TO BE POOPED ON
 THOUGH.
 IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
 I'M SURE WE CAN STOP THEM IN
 THE BACK.
 I'LL TAKE ONE HOME ON THE
 PLANE WITH ME.
 HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY.
 THANK YOU.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT
 SAYS IT EMPOWERS WOMEN THE MORE
 WE TALK ABOUT EMBRACING AGE.
 IT'S INEVITABLE, GUYS.
 WE CAN'T STOP IT.
 WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR
 WOMEN TO HOLD ON AND OWN THEIR
 NUMBERS?
 I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SCARED.
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE
 SAID IT ON CAMERA, THAT I JUST
 TURNED 50.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I WAS SO AFRAID, BUT THEN I WAS,
 LIKE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS
 BEEN SCARED OF DYING SINCE I WAS
 12 YEARS OLD.
 I'M GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE
 SURVIVED THIS LONG.
 WHAT AM I COMPLAINING ABOUT?
 I DID EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO
 BE AS HEALTHY AND LOOK AND FEEL
 AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE.
 I HAD MY BIG BIRTHDAY AND I FEEL
 REALLY GREAT.
 YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.
 YES, YOU ARE.
 I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
 YOU'RE, LIKE, THERE'S NO WAY TO
 STOP IT.
 THERE'S ONE WAY TO STOP IT, BUT
 THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ALL WANT.
 STOP IT THAT WAY.
 YOU EMBRACE IT.
 I'M SORRY.
 I WAS JUST HOLDING A PIG.
 YOU ARE A MOM, AN ACTRESS AND
 YOUR LIFE HAS PLAYED OUT IN
 FRONT OF THE CAMERAS, BUT THAT
 MUST BE KIND OF DIFFICULT.
 WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THIS
 SEASON OF THE SHOW BECAUSE THIS
 SHOW IS --
 ON FIRE.
 I LOVE IT.
 IT IS SO GOOD.
 THIS SEASON IS A VERY, VERY
 CRAZY SEASON, BUT FOR THE
 VIEWERS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
 ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE SEASONS.
 THAT MEANS FOR THE CAST MEMBERS,
 IT'S A TORTURE SEASON.
 WHEN WE'RE TORTURED, THE
 AUDIENCE IS HAPPY.
 YES.
 THANK YOU?
 BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS JUST
 SO MUCH GOING ON.
 IT IS A LOT TO JUGGLE.
 I HAVE FOUR KIDS AND MY HUSBAND
 AND FIVE DOGS, BUT, YOU KNOW,
 THEY CAPTURE A LOT OF THAT, YOU
 KNOW, BUT THEY, YOU KNOW, SEE US
 WOMEN GOING CRAZY AND OUR
 COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS.
 SPEAKING OF THOSE COMPLEX
 RELATIONSHIPS, LISA VANDERPUMP
 WAS HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND
 FANS HAVE WATCHED THE
 RELATIONSHIP TAKE UPS AND DOWNS.
 DO YOU THINK IT WILL SURVIVE
 THIS SEASON?
 WELL, IT DIDN'T SO FAR.
 I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT IN A
 GOOD PLACE RIGHT NOW.
 YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF SEE IT IN
 THE TEASER OF THE SEASON, THE
 TRAILER, BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT
 ONE DAY WE'LL GET BACK TO WHERE
 WE WERE BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT
 LISA A LOT.
 WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF TIME, WITH
 YOU IT'S DIFFICULT WITH
 EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON.
 I'M HOPEFUL WE'LL GET BACK THERE
 ONE DAY.
 ARE YOU THE TYPE OF PERSON
 THAT APOLOGIZES FIRST OR ARE YOU
 THE KIND THAT WAITS FOR AN
 APOLOGY?
 I HAVE NO -I HAVE NO
 PROBLEM APOLOGIZING.
 WHEN YOU ARE WRONG.
 WHEN I'M WRONG.
 OF COURSE, YEAH.
 BUT YEAH.
 I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT AT
 THAT.
 I CAN'T TELL OF THE
 REPERCUSSIONS OF WHAT I WAS
 THINKING.
 THAT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE
 TIME.
 YOUR SISTER, KIM, IS BACK ON THE
 SHOW.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 SHE ISN'T HOUSEWIFE,
 BUT SHE HAS BEEN BACK FOR SOME
 EPISODES.
 HOW ARE YOU HANDLING THAT?
 WE HAVE GONE THROUGH VERY,
 VERY DIFFICULT TIMES ON THE
 SHOW, BUT I LOVE WHEN SHE'S ON
 THE SHOW.
 I WISH SHE WAS THERE ALL THE
 TIME.
 MY KIDS SAY SHE'S THEIR FAVORITE
 HOUSEWIFE.
 SHE'S JUST FUNNY AND YOU NEVER
 KNOW WHAT KIM IS GOING TO SAY OR
 DO.
 I LOVE THAT ABOUT HER.
 YOU SAY YOU HAVE FOUR KIDS, A
 HUSBAND --
 FIVE DOGS.
 FIVE DOGS, AND YOU HAD YOUR
 FIRST DAUGHTER WHEN YOU WERE 19
 AND YOUR LAST WHEN YOU WERE 39.
 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE FOR YOU
 RAISING A DAUGHTER AT 19 AS
 OPPOSED TO RAISING A DAUGHTER
 NOW?
 PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME THAT
 AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 19, I
 WAS THE MOM WITH THE BIRTHDAY
 PARTY WITH THE JUMPY HOUSE AND I
 JUMPING WITH ALL THE KIDS AND I
 HAD SO MUCH ENERGY AND, LIKE,
 NOT AS MUCH PATIENCE.
 NOW I HAVE SO MUCH PATIENCE AND
 NOT AS MUCH ENERGY.
 I ACTUALLY DO, BUT I'M NOT THE
 MOM JUMPING IN THE BOUNCY HOUSE,
 BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU RELAX
 BY THE FOURTH.
 I'M STILL WORRIED AND NEUROTIC
 AND, YOU KNOW, STRESSED.
 WISER TOO.
 YOU KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 MY KIDS LAUGH, LIKE, MOM, YOU
 WOULD NEVER HAVE LET ME DO THAT.
 THE FOURTH ONE, YOU ARE
 DEFINITELY MORE KICK BACK ABOUT
 THINGS, BUT YOU WORRY THE SAME
 NO MATTER HOW MANY KIDS.
 DEFINITELY THERE IS A VIDEO
 YOU WANT TO SHOW BECAUSE YOU
 KICK THAT WELL.
 WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW?
 THIS IS -SO SHE SAYS -YOU
 SAY YOU ARE NOT IN THE BOUNCY
 HOUSE, BUT THERE IS A LOT OF
 BOUNCING GOING ON RIGHT HERE.
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 ENERGY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A
 PROBLEM FOR YOU.
 I HAVE GOOD ENERGY LEVELS.
 WE CAN EMBARRASS OUR KIDS TOO.
 I LOVE IT.
 IT'S FUN.
 EVERY PARENT SHOULD EMBARRASS
 YOUR KIDS.
 ALL OF YOU, EMBARRASS YOUR KIDS.
 IN A GOOD WAY.

 KYLE, WE LOVE HAVING YOU HERE
 AND TELL YOUR HUSBAND I SAID
 HELLO.
 ALWAYS A NICE MAN TO ME.
 GOOD LUCK WITH THE SEASON.
 WE'RE NOT LETTING HER GO
 ANYWHERE THOUGH.
 WE'RE NOT?
 SHE'S STICKING AROUND.
 WHAT?
 SHE'S GOING TO STAY.
 EVEN BETTER.
 YOU CAN ASK US ANYTHING YOU
 WANT TO KNOW.
 THEY WILL ANSWER WHATEVER
 THEY WANT TO KNOW?
 NO, BUT SHE IS.
 WHATEVER YOU WANT.

            Sometimes,
      bipolar I disorder can
        make you feel like
       you have no limits.
    But mania, such as unusual
       changes in your mood,
    activity or energy levels,
        can leave you on...
           shaky ground.
    Help take control by asking
     your healthcare provider
          about VRAYLAR.
    VRAYLAR treats acute mania
      of bipolar I disorder.
   VRAYLAR significantly reduces
      overall manic symptoms,
   and was proven in adults with
      mixed episodes who have
    both mania and depression.
    VRAYLAR should not be used
     in elderly patients with
    dementia, due to increased
     risk of death or stroke.
   Call your doctor about fever,
   stiff muscles, or confusion,
         which may mean a
     life-threatening reaction
         or uncontrollable
         muscle movements,
      which may be permanent.
    Side effects may not appear
        for several weeks.
    High cholesterol and weight
   gain; high blood sugar, which
    can lead to coma or death;
   decreased white blood cells,
        which can be fatal;
     dizziness upon standing;
     falls; seizures; impaired
 judgement; heat sensitivity; and
   trouble swallowing may occur.

 REALEST -THAT'S NOT A WORD --
 HOUSEWIFE, KYLE RICHARDS.
 IT'S TIME FOR A SEGMENT CALLED
 ASK US ANYTHING.
 WE'RE GIVING MEMBERS OF OUR
 TERRIFIC STUDIO AUDIENCE A
 CHANCE TO ASK US QUESTIONS THEY
 HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW.
 LET'S GET TO OUR FIRST QUESTION.
 WHERE IS LUCY?
 HEY, LUCY.
 HI.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WHAT YOU GOT?
 HI, KYLE.
 HI.
 I KNOW YOU HAVE FOUR CHILDREN
 SO I WAS WONDERING, WILL YOUR
 CHILDREN FOLLOW YOU INTO THE
 PROFESSION OF ACTING AND IF SO,
 DO YOU FULLY SUPPORT THEM IN
 THAT DECISION?
 THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS SHOWED
 ANY INTEREST IS MY YOUNGEST,
 PORTIA, AND YES, I WOULD SUPPORT
 HER 100%.
 SHE'S GOOD AT IT.
 IF SHE'S GOOD AT SOMETHING, I'LL
 ENCOURAGE IT, ABSOLUTELY.
 THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.
 THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 YOU HAVE LITTLE, YOUNG BABIES.
 MY KID'S A PERFORMER, BUT
 HE'S 3.
 THEY ALL ARE AT 3.
 THAT'S TRUE.
 NEXT UP IS BEATRICE.
 BEATRICE, WHERE ARE YOU?
 HEY.
 HI, KYLE.
 I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR
 23 YEARS.
 WHAT'S YOUR SECRET TO A
 SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE?
 I THINK IT STARTS WITH
 CHOOSING THE RIGHT PARTNER.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE, LIKE, WE'RE
 DATING AND IN COUPLE'S THERAPY.
 THAT'S KIND OF A RED FLAG.
 LIFE IS GOING TO THROW YOU SO
 MANY CURVEBALLS.
 YOU HAVE TO START OUT WITH THE
 RIGHT PARTNER, AND THEN
 FROM THERE HONESTLY, YOU KNOW,
 PICKING SOMEONE THAT YOU ENJOY
 THE SAME THINGS AND LETTING THE
 OTHER PERSON BE THEMSELVES, YOU
 KNOW, WE GOT MARRIED IN OUR 20s.
 WE WERE KIDS AND YOU CHANGE A
 LOT OVER THOSE YEARS.
 GROWING WITH THAT PERSON,
 ALLOWING THEM TO BE WHO THEY ARE
 AND SUPPORTING THAT.
 AND LAUGHING.
 LAUGHING.
 SOMEONE YOU CAN LAUGH AND
 HAVE FUN WITH.
 NEXT UP, WHERE IS JARED?
 HERE.
 HI, JARED.

 HI.
 IF YOU COULD BRING BACK ANY PAST
 HOUSEWIFE, WHO WOULD IT BE?
 YOU LIKE THAT QUESTION,
 DIDN'T YOU?
 I THINK WE HAVE AN AMEN IN

 WHERE IS MY MAN, KEITH?
 HEY, KEITH.
 WHAT YOU GOT?
 HOWDY.
 WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART ABOUT
 BEING A TV PERSONALITY?
 AND SARA, YOUR CHEEKBONES ARE
 KILLING IT.
 THESE LITTLE THINGS?
 THEY'RE STARTING TO BLEND IN
 WITH MY WHOLE FACE AS I GAIN
 BABY WEIGHT UP HERE.
 WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART?
 WHAT'S MY FAVORITE PART?
 THERE IS A LOT OF PERKS AND A
 LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT, YOU
 KNOW, COME WITH IT, BUT THERE IS
 A LOT OF DOWNSIDE WITH MY JOB IN
 PARTICULAR, BUT I DON'T KNOW.
 OBVIOUSLY WE GET TO DO A LOT OF
 FUN THINGS AND I HAVE GREAT HOME
 VIDEOS FOR MY KIDS BECAUSE I
 STOPPED DOING THAT EVER SINCE WE
 GOT THE iPHONES.
 YEAH.
 I THINK JUST HAVING THE
 PLATFORM TO TALK ABOUT THINGS
 THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND, YOU
 KNOW, TO HAVE A VOICE FOR THINGS
 THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO GET OUT
 THERE.
 I WOULD SAY MY FAVORITE PART
 IS GETTING PEOPLE TO LAUGH.
 WHEN SOMEONE TWEETS OR REACHES
 OUT AND SAYS, I WAS HAVING A
 ROUGH DAY OR MY MOM'S IN SURGERY
 AND I WAS WATCHING YOU AND FELT
 A MOMENT OF ESCAPE, IT IS, LIKE,
 THE BEST THING I EVER HEAR IS
 KNOWING FOR ONE MINUTE, YOU MADE
 SOMEONE HAPPY.
 I AGREE.
 I AGREE WITH THAT.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I THINK BOTH OF THAT.
 JUST HAVING, LIKE, A LOG OF YOUR
 LIFE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
 AND ALSO ENTERTAINING PEOPLE AND
 MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH.
 TO ME, IT'S, LIKE, THE
 ONE-ON-ONE THING HERE IN THE
 STUDIO.
 I LOVE ALL THAT.
 WE LOVED HAVING YOU GUYS HERE.

     JARDIANCE asked:
    When it comes to managing    your type 2 diabetes,
       what matters to you?
            Let's see.    Most of you say lower A1C.
      But only a few of you
  are thinking about your heart.
     Fact is, even though     it helps to manage A1C,
      type 2 diabetes still      increases your risk
        of a fatal heart        attack or stroke.
      JARDIANCE is the first      type 2 diabetes pill
        with a lifesaving      cardiovascular benefit
   for adults who have type 2   diabetes and heart disease,
    JARDIANCE significantly    reduces the risk of dying
   from a cardiovascular event
         and lowers A1C,     with diet and exercise.
    Let's give it another try.
      <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i>      <i> serious side effects</i>
     <i> including dehydration.</i>
      <i> This may cause you</i>      <i> to feel dizzy, faint,</i>
         <i> or lightheaded,</i>     <i> or weak upon standing.</i>
          <i> Ketoacidosis</i>    <i> is a serious side effect</i>
       <i> that may be fatal.</i>
    <i> Symptoms include nausea,</i>    <i> vomiting, stomach pain,</i>
           <i> tiredness,</i>     <i> and trouble breathing.</i>
   <i> A rare but life-threatening</i>       <i> bacterial infection</i>
   <i> in the skin of the genital</i>   <i> area could also occur.</i>
      <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> and call your doctor right away</i>
      <i> if you have symptoms</i>  <i> of this bacterial infection,</i>
          <i> ketoacidosis</i>    <i> or an allergic reaction.</i>
     <i> Symptoms of an allergic</i>     <i> reaction include rash,</i>
    <i> swelling, and difficulty</i>    <i> breathing or swallowing.</i>
     <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i>     <i> if you are on dialysis</i>
 <i> or have severe kidney problems.</i>
     <i> Other side effects are</i>     <i> sudden kidney problems,</i>
   <i> genital yeast infections,</i>   <i> increased bad cholesterol,</i>
  <i> and urinary tract infections,</i>      <i> which may be serious.</i>
    <i> Taking JARDIANCE with</i>    <i> a sulfonylurea or insulin</i>
   <i> may cause low blood sugar.</i>
   <i> Tell your doctor about</i>   <i> all the medicines you take</i>
       <i> and if you have any</i>       <i> medical conditions.</i>
  Isn't it time to rethink your  type 2 diabetes medication?
 Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE
       and get to the heart       of what matters.
 Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE

 TAKE THE END OF THIS LEASH
 AND PUT IT THROUGH THE HOLE OF
 THE TABLE RIGHT HERE.
 THIS TABLE IS A SURGICAL
 OPERATION TABLE FROM THE CIVIL
 WAR ERA.
 BACK THEN, THEY DID NOT HAVE
 ANAESTHESIA, SO THEY WOULD HOLD
 VICTIMS IN PLACE WITH STRAPS
 LIKE JUST LIKE THESE STRAPS
 HERE.
 YEAH.
 I WOULD LIKE YOU TO PLEASE LOCK
 MY ASSISTANT'S ANKLES IN PLACE,
 AND IF YOU WOULD WALK TO THE
 BACK HERE.
 OKAY.
 PICK UP THIS COLLAR AND I
 WANT YOU TO PUT IT ON HER NECK
 VERY TIGHT, BUT TRY NOT TO CHOKE
 HER.
 WHAT KIND OF TRICK IS THIS?
 TRY NOT TO CHOKE HER.
 I NEED TO KEEP HER ALIVE FOR MY
 OTHER SHOWS.
 SORRY.
 BACK IN THE CIVIL WAR ERA,
 THEY HAD NO ANAESTHESIA, SO
 THESE STRAPS WERE REQUIRED TO A
 VICTIM WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE AND
 NOT MOVE DURING SURGERY.
 SARA, IF YOU WILL HOLD THIS
 LEASH RIGHT HERE.
 HOLD TIGHT WITH TWO HANDS, AND
 MICHAEL, YOU HOLD AS WELL.
 DO NOT LET GO.
 DON'T PULL ON HER.
 CUT HER APART.
 NOT RIP HER APART.
 EVEN THOUGH SHE'S MOMENTARILY
 COVERED.
 YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HER BODY
 THROUGH THESE WINDOWS HERE IN
 THE FRONT.
 ARE YOU OKAY?
 EVERY TIME I OPEN THESE
 WINDOWS -KEEP HER LEASH TIGHT
 AND MAKE SURE SHE'S STILL THERE
 AND LOCKED IN PLACE.
 LET EVERYONE AT HOME KNOW WITH A
 THUMBS UP.
 EXCELLENT.
 GREAT ENTHUSIASM.
 BOTH CHECK IT.
 MAKE SURE IT IS SOLID.
 PERFECT.
 EXCELLENT.
 NOW I WANT YOU BOTH TO WATCH
 CAREFULLY AS I PLACE THIS BLADE
 INSIDE OF THE BOX.
 YOU CAN SEE THE BLADE COMPLETELY
 FILLS THE BOX ALL THE WAY FRONT
 TO BACK AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS,
 YES?
 RIGHT NOW, THIS BLADE IS RESTING
 ON HER BODY.
 ARE YOU OKAY?
 THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE SHE CAN
 GO AND WHERE THE BLADE CAN GO.
 KEEP IT TIGHT.
 KEEP IT TIGHT.
 GIVE US A SIGN IF IT'S NOT
 WORKING OUT.
 HOLD TIGHT WITH BOTH HANDS.
 DON'T LET GO.
 DO NOT LET GO, SARA.
 THEY DON'T PAY ME ENOUGH TO
 DO THIS.
 NOW MICHAEL, LOOK DOWN BELOW.
 MAKE SURE YOU CAN SEE THE BLADE
 PASS THROUGH THE ENTIRE BOX.
 I'M LOOKING TO SEE BLOOD.
 ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM.
 OH, WOW.
 CHECK OUT YOUR WINDOW.
 MAKE SURE SHE'S STILL THERE.
 OH MY GOSH.
 IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
 DO NOT LET GO.
 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THINGS ONE
 STEP FURTHER.
 HOLD TIGHT.
 DON'T MAKE ME PULL THIS
 APART.
 TWO HANDS.
 EW.
 SARA, IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR SIDE
 MUST HAVE SHIFTED.
 I THINK WE HAD TOO MUCH SLACK
 THERE.
 GIVE YOUR LEASH A LITTLE PULL.
 ONE, TWO, THREE --
 I'M SORRY.
 GIVE IT A TUG.
 DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST
 DID?
 OH, MAN.
 OH, NO.
 IS SHE -SHE'S NOT.
 DO NOT LET GO.
 I'M NOT LETTING GO.
 WE NOW HAVE A WOMAN DIVIDED.
 LET'S PUT HER BACK.
 THAT IS RESILIENT.
 HOLD TIGHT, TWO HANDS.
 ONE FINAL TIME.
 CHECK OUT YOUR WINDOW AND MAKE
 SURE SHE'S STILL THERE.
 LOCKED IN PLACE.
 GIVE IT A THUMBS UP.
 DO NOT LET GO OF YOUR LEASH JUST
 YET, AND PLEASE COME TO THE
 TABLE.
 RELEASE HER.
 LET HER OUT OF THE STRAPS.
 OH MY GOSH.
 OH, YOU POOR THING.
 SHE LOOKS REALLY GOOD.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 COME BACK OVER HERE.
 COME BACK.
 WE PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER.
 GET IN HERE.

 US TODAY.
