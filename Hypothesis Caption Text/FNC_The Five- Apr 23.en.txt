 THAT NEWS CYCLE.
 IT HAPPEN FAR AWAY AND IN
 AMERICA, IT'S PEACEFUL TIME
 PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW MAKING
 SURE IT'S STILL PEACEFUL UNTIL
 ONE DAY WHEN TERROR STRIKES AS
 AT HOME, AS IT HAS BEFORE.
 WE CAN'T FORGET THAT AMERICA IS
 TERROR TARGET NUMBER ONE AND
 THAT OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
 ISN'T IMPEACHMENT BUT SECURITY,
 OUR BORDERS, GRADE, LANDMARKS,
 WATER, FOOD SUPPLY.

 IT WILL ALWAYS GIVE BIRTH TO

 WE ARE OEROUTRAJECTORY, NOT TO R

 IF THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE
 FOCUSED ON, IT
                SHOULD BE SECURITY FIRST.
 I THINK YES, THE MESSAGING IS
 IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S TRAVELING
 AROUND THE WORLD.
 Greg: DANA, THEY HAD A TWO
 WEEK'S ADVANCED WARNING?
 DID THEY NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
 OR WAS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT
 JUST GOT LOST?
 Dana: THEY WILL HAVE TO
 FIND OUT BUT WHAT A WAY TO
 FIGURE IT OUT, AFTERWARDS.
 SECRETARY POMPEO WAS QUITE
 GRACIOUS TODAY TO THE SRI
 LANKANS, SAY THAT WE WILL HELP
 AND PROVIDE THIS BUT WE'VE BEEN
 HELPING AND WE HELP ALL THESE
 COUNTRIES.
 MAYBE THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH
 FOREIGN AID AS THEY WOULD LIKE
 BUT THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
 FOR US TOO.
 THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SHARE
 THE INFORMATION WITH EACH OTHER
 OR AT LEAST WITH US.
 I GOT THE STATISTICS TODAY FROM
 THE BRAIN ROOM, SINCE 2012,
 23,177 CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN
 KILLED FOR FAITH-RELATED
 REASONS.

 IT IS ABHORRENT, ACCEPTABLE, AND
 IF WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE AID
 AND WERE GOING TO PROVIDE
 INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, SHARING,
 MILITARY GEAR, WHATEVER IT IS
 THEY NEED, THE LEAST THEY CAN DO
 IS PASS IT UP THE CHAIN THAT
 THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN
 ATTACKER COULD HAVE BEEN
 PREVENTED.
 Greg: JUAN, THERE WERE
 EIGHT COORDINATED DETONATIONS.
 THIS IS A GROUP WE'VE NEVER
 HEARD OF BUT IT'S KIND OF THE
 SAME THING, RIGHT?
 IT MUTATES, CHANGES, EVOLVES,
 GETS BETTER.
 Juan: THIS IS THE ARGUMENT
 THAT WE HAVE HERE BEFORE I START
 THAT, LET ME SAY THE KIDS THAT
  GRADER FROM A
 SCHOOL IN D.C.
 THREE OF THE FOUR CHILDREN OF A
 DANISH BILLIONAIRE WHO IS THE
 BIGGEST LANDOWNER IN BRITAIN.
 I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THE DEPTH
 OF HIS SADNESS
 ■ PEOPLE WERE KILLED.
 THIS WAS A WORLDWIDE EVENT IN
 THAT SENSE.
 IT TOUCHED US ALL.
 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP
 IN MIND AND WE SEE IT IN THE
 U.S., MORE SECURITY IN OUR
 CHURCHES IN THE AFTERMATH OF
 THIS, AND THERE WERE SOME
 SUSPICIONS WENT BACK TO
 NOTRE DAME IN PARIS.
 IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
 WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY ISIS IS
 DEFEATED, I WORRY ABOUT IT.
 BECAUSE PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THEN
 WE DON'T HAVE A THREAT BUT WE DO
 HAVE A THREAT.
 WE HAVE A THREAT, AS YOU
 DESCRIBED, AS YOU SAID WATER
 GOES WHEREVER THERE IS AN
 OPENING.
 WE SEE IS THIS IDEOLOGY SHIFTS
 AND WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS
 GROUP.
 ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY POP UP AND
 THEY ARE BOMBING A CHURCH IN
 SRI LANKA AND THEY ARE GOING
 AFTER CHRISTIANS.
 TO ME, IT'S A GENERATIONAL
 FIGHT.
 THE IDEOLOGY UNFORTUNATELY IS
 NOT DEFEATED AND WE AS AMERICANS
 CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT
 THAT WE ARE IN AN ONGOING FIGHT.
 WHEN THE PRESIDENT BOASTS FOR
 WHATEVER REASON THAT ISIS IS
 DEFEATED, DON'T BE FOOLED.
 WE'VE GOT TO KEEP UP NOT ONLY
 THE ATTENTION BUT THE FIGHT.
 WITH REGARD TO THE INTELLIGENCE,
 WE KNOW THERE'S SOME ARGUMENTS
 ABOUT, DID WE KNOW WHAT WAS
 COMING ON 9/11.
 YOU CAN BLAME AND SAY THEY ARE
 INCOMPETENT, THEY ARE NOT THE
 U.S. GOVERNMENT, NOT U.S.
 INTELLIGENCE, NOT ISRAELI
 INTELLIGENCE.
 THE FACT IS THE PEOPLE
 RESPONSIBLE ARE THE TERRORISTS.
 Dana: CAN I CLARIFY?
 AFTER 9/11 IS WHEN WE TOOK DOWN
 THE WALL BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE
 AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.
 THAT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE.
 THEN WE STEPPED UP EFFORTS ALL
 AROUND THE WORLD TO MAKE SURE
 THOSE GOVERNMENTS WHERE YOU KNEW
 THAT THERE WERE HOT SPOTS WOULD
 HAVE WHAT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER
 TO SHARE THE INFORMATION AND
 HAVE THE EQUIPMENT.
 WE LEARNED A LESSON.
 IF ARE GOING TO HELP THESE
 COUNTRIES, THE LEAST THEY CAN
 DO, THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION.
 THEY DIDN'T PASS IT ON.
 Juan: CORRECT.
 I THINK WE'VE MADE CHANGES AND
 WE HAVE ADAPTED POST-9/11 BUT I
 JUST DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE
 WOULD SAY IT'S THEIR FAILURE.
 PEOPLE DID THAT TO US.
 I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
 I DIDN'T THINK WAS FAIR TO US OR
 OUR GOVERNMENT.
 I THINK THE TERRORISTS ARE THE
 ONES WHO SHOULD BE HELD
 RESPONSIBLE.
 GSE, WE'VE SEEN
 DIFFERENT RESPONSES, SOME ARE
 ODD.
 WOULD YOU CARE TO PICK THE ONES
 THAT DISCUSSED YOU THE MOST?
 Jesse: I HAVE
 "THE WASHINGTON POST" HERE AND
 IT'S JUST KIND OF DISGUSTING.
 CHRISTIANITY UNDER ATTACK.
 SRI LANKA CHURCH BOMBINGS STOKE
 FAR RIGHT ANGER IN THE WEST.
 IT'S A WHOLE ARTICLE, NOT ABOUT,
 'S EDITORIALIZING SAYING
 OH, CHRISTIANS ARE UPSET THAT
 CHURCHES ARE BEING BOMBED.
 THEY ARE MAKING CHRISTIANS AND
 CONSERVATIVES OUT TO BE THE
 VILLAINS FOR REACTING TO
 TERRORIST ATTACKS.
 LOOK AT SOME OF THE LEADING
 DEMOCRATS, HOW THEY CHARACTERIZE
 IT.
 THEY DIDN'T USE CHRISTIANS.
 THEY DIDN'T SAY CHURCHES.
 HE ACTUALLY SAID EASTER
 WORSHIPERS WERE UNDER ATTACK.
 YOU DON'T CALL MUSLIMS
 RAMADAN-WORSHIPERS.
 YOU DON'T CALL JEWS
 PASSOVER-WORSHIPERS.
 IT'S A MADE-UP PHRASE.
 WHY DID THEY MAKE UP PHRASES
 LIKE THIS?
 IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE
 DON'T TRUST LIBERALS BECAUSE
 THEY ARE NOT IN TOUCH WITH
 REALITY.
 THEY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE
 PANDERING TO MUSLIMS BECAUSE A
 LOT OF LIBERALS FEEL THEY ARE SO
 UPSET WITH HOW OTHER PEOPLE
 THINK ABOUT THEM AND IF THEY ARE
 THOUGHT UP TO BE INSENSITIVE, IT
 DRIVES HIM CRAZY.
 SECOND OF ALL, THEY THINK THEIR
 OWN RHETORIC CAUSES ISLAMIC
 EXTREMISM.
 REMEMBER, BLAME AMERICA FIRST?
 THEY THINK ISLAMAPHOBIA CAUSES
 RADICAL ISLAM SO THEY DO
 WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SANITIZE
 IT.
 BUZZFEED ACTUALLY CAME OUT, ONE
 OF THEIR EDITORS, AND SAID
 PRESIDENT TRUMP, IMAGINE HOW
 OUTRAGED HE WOULD BE IF WHITES
 WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE
 SRI LANKA ATTACK.
 I FOUND THAT COMPLETELY
 DESPICABLE TO PLAY THE RACE CARD
 AFTER A TERRORIST ATTACK.
 IT'S WHAT THEY DID IN CATENA.
 REMEMBER, BUSH?
 HE WOULD'VE ACTED FASTER IF THEY
 WERE WHITE VICTIMS IN LOUISIANA.
 WHEN I STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT
 IT, CONSERVATIVES ARE PRETTY
 COLOR-BLIND WHEN IT COMES TO
 LIFE.
 THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE
 DIFFERENT RACES, BABIES AND THE
 WARMS.
 THEY WANT TO PROTECT ALL LIFE.
 HAVE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES IN
 THE MEDIA WHO TALK ABOUT
 STOPPING THE CARNAGE IN THE
 SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO.
 I THINK IT'S REALLY UNFAIR WHEN
 THE MEDIA ALWAYS, NO MATTER WHO
 DOES THAT, IF IT'S A WHITE
 PERPETRATOR, MUSLIM PERPETRATOR,
 HISPANIC PERPETRATOR, THEY JUST
 TAKE THE VIOLENCE AND THEY TRIED
 TO TURN IT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
 OR HIS SUPPORTERS AND I THINK
 REALLY SHAMEFUL.
 Greg: ALL RIGHT.
 WELL, LET'S MOVE ON.

 Juan: AT THIS MOMENT, DEMOCRATS CONVENING A CONFERENCE
 CALL TO FIGURE WHAT THEIR NEXT
 MOVE WILL BE POSTMEAL REPORT.
 SOME SAY IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS
 COULD BE COMING AGAINST
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT
 IMPEACHMENT WOULD BE
 UNSUCCESSFUL IF THE REPUBLICAN
 PARTY CONTINUES TO PLACE PARTY
 ABOVE COUNTRY.
 YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S
 ENOUGH INFORMATION THEY ARE NOT
 ONLY ON OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
 BUT ALSO ON COLLUSION OR
 CONSPIRACY, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
 CALL IT, T M FORWARD WITH
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I'VE CALLED ON THE HOUSE TO
 INITIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING
 PROCEEDINGS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Juan: PRESIDENT TRUMP
 MOCKING THE MOVE ON TWITTER.
 HE SAYS:
 "ONLY HIGH CRIMES AND
 MISDEMEANORS CAN LEAD TO
 IMPEACHMENT.
 THERE WERE NO CRIMES BY ME
 NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION,
 SO YOU CAN'T IMPEACH.
 IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS THAT
 COMMITTED THE CRIMES, NOT YOUR
 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT!
 TABLES ARE FINALLY TURNING
 ON THE WITCH HUNT!"
 TRUMP ALSO DISMISSING THE
 MUELLER REPORT AND IMPEACHMENT
 THREATS EARLIER.
 ARE YOU WORT YOUR
 STAFF...
 ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT, MR. PRESIDENT  ?
 Juan: ALL RIGHT, DANA,
 LET'S GO TO THE REALITY HERE,
 WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT THIS
 CONFERENCE CALL, NANCY PELOSI IS
 HOLDING.
 Dana: IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT
 NOW.
 THE MOST PUBLICIZED CONFERENCE
 CALL.
 YOU CAN BET THERE'S 20 REPORTERS
 ON THE CALL.
 Juan: ONE ARGUMENT IS ABOUT
 ACCOUNTABILITY.
 SAYING THAT CONGRESS HAS A
 RESPONSIBILITY TO HOLD THE
 PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE.
 THE OTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT IT'S
 ONLY 18 MONTHS UNTIL THE NEXT
 ELECTION AND THERE'S A DANGER
 THAT YOU JUST ENERGIZED TRUMP'S
 BASE BECAUSE HE WILL SAVE THE
 DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO GET ME
 OUT.
 Dana: I THINK THE DEMOCRATS
 BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION HAVE BEEN
 DIVIDING INTO HOSTILE CAMPS.
 OR AS PRESIDENT OBAMA REMINDERS,
 CIRCULAR FIRING SQUAD IS WHEN
 YOU TURN YOUR GUNS ON EACH
 OTHER.
 ON ONE SIDE YOU HAVE THE
 CAUTIOUS OLD GUARD, THE
 ESTABLISHMENT, THINK WE REMEMBER
 WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REPUBLICANS
 WHEN THEY DID IT TO CLINTON.
 THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE EGG ON
 THEIR FACE AND YOU HAVE THE
 FORMER SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH
 SAYING THAT LOOKING BACK ON A
 THAT MIGHT'VE NOT OF BEEN THE
 BEST THING TO PURSUE.
 THEN YOU HAVE THE FIREBRANDS
 SAYING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, WE
 WANT THIS.
 THERE WAS A SURVEY, THEY PULLED
 DEMOCRATS.
 51% OF THOSE WHO ARE VERY
 LIBERALS THAT WE WANT
 IMPEACHMENT.
 31 PER SAY WORTH THE DEMOCRATS
 TIME TO PURSUE.
 I THINK WHAT COULD HAPPEN IS
 THAT YOU WILL GET HEARINGS AND
 YOU WILL HAVE ONGOING THINGS IN
 THE WALK UP TO THE LINE OF
 IMPEACHMENT.
 IT WILL BE HARASSMENT,
 CONSIDERED HARASSMENT FROM THE
 PRESIDENT'S PERSPECTIVE BUT THEY
 WON'T QUITE ACTUALLY GO TO
 IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW
 THAT IT WON'T PASS IN THE
 CENTAGE.
 THE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT
 OUT, IN THE COMMERCIAL BREAK WE
 SAW THAT THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE HAS SUBPOENAED DONALD
 McGAHN, THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER
 LAWYER.
 HE WAS AT THE QUESTION OF THE
 OBSTRUCTION PIECE.
 Juan: JESSE, MUELLER IS
 GOING TO HAVE TO TESTIFY AT SOME
 POINT AND OF COURSE, AS DANA
 POINTED OUT, YOUR -- SEVERAL
 CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES
 LAUNCHING THEIR OWN
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 IS IMPEACHMENT REDUNDANT?
 Juan: I DON'T KNOW, JUAN.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST CRASHED
 SURVEYMONKEY THAT.
 Dana: WE DON'T PUT THEM
 ONLINE.
 Jesse: JUAN, DON'T CITE
 LAURENCE TRIBE.
 HE WAS OUT THERE FOR TWO YEARS
 SAYING THAT THERE WAS COLLUSION.
 HE PROBABLY GOT IT MORE WRONG
 THAN ANYONE ELSE BESIDES ADAM
 SCHIFF.
 MAXINE WATERS, NO RELATION, THAT
 MIGHT'VE BEEN ONE OF THE DUMBEST
 THING SHE'S EVER SAID.
 CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT SHE JUST
 SAID?
 LET'S IMPEACH TRUMP FOR
 COLLUSION.
 DID SHE NOT READ THE MUELLER
 REPORT?
 THERE'S NO COLLUSION AND SHE
 WANTS TO IMPEACH FOR COLLUSION.
 JUAN!
 HOW COULD YOU NOT NOTICE THAT?
 IT'S THE DUMBEST THING SHE'S
 EVER SAID.
 Juan: I WILL LET YOU ARGUE
 IT.
 Jesse: PRESIDENT TRUMP
 SURVIVED THE COUP AND THE
 DEMOCRATS ARE FREAKING OUT
 BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE MUELLER
 REPORT WAS GOING TO DELIVER THE
 GOODS AND IT DIDN'T.
 HE HAS A FAT WAR CHEST, HOT
 ECONOMY AND DEMOCRATS HAVE
 DOZENS OF PEOPLE RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE ALL
 CRAZY.
 THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T WIN AT THE
 BALLOT BOX SO THEY HAVE TO
 IMPEACH ANOTHER MEDIA WANTS THEM
 TO IMPEACH BECAUSE THEY FEEL
 LIKE THEY HAVE TO JUSTIFY THE
 HOAX THEY PERPETRATED FOR TWO
 YEARS.
 Juan: THE MEDIA WANTS IT?
 Jesse: YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN
 BEGGING FOR IT.
 Juan: NANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN
 VERY CLEAR THAT GIVEN THE SENATE
 IS IN REPUBLICANS HANDS AND
 THERE'S BEEN NO REAL DEPARTURE
 OF REPUBLICANS FROM
 PRESIDENT TRUMP, SHE DOESN'T SEE
 THE BENEFIT OF IMPEACHMENT.
 THAT'S FROM NOT ONLY
 NANCY PELOSI BUT HOUSE
 LEADERSHIP AND WITH THE
 EXCEPTION OF ELIZABETH WARREN,
 ALL OF THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 Emily: PELOSI AND SOME OF
 THEM HAVE BEEN CLEARED IN THAT
 REGARD BUT PLENTY HAVE NOT AND
 ARE FURTHERING THE IMPEACHMENT
 FLAG ON THE LEFT.
 TWO THINGS STRIKE ME.
 WHEN ADAM SCHIFF SAYS IS IT IN
 THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY
 TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT?
 MAYBE IT'S YES.
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 THE COLOSSAL EFFORT BEING
 UNDERTAKEN BY THE HOUSE IN TERMS
 OF THE COLLABORATION, THE
 FINANCE COMMITTEE, INTELLIGENCE,
 WAYS AND MEANS, 100-PLUS
 SUBPOENAS, MOST OF THEM REQUIRE
 VOTES ON THE COMMITTEES TO DO
 SO.
 THEY ARE SUBPOENAING THE U.S.
 TREASURY DEPARTMENT,
 DEUTSCHE BANK.
 WHAT ARE THEY NOT DOING?
 THEY ARE NOT LEGISLATING.
 ALL OF THAT EFFORT IS TAKEN AWAY
 FROM WHAT WE ELECTED THEM TO DO
 AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT, IT'S NOT JUST THE
 EXPECTED $2 MILLION BUT THOSE
 MAN-HOURS THAT WILL DETRACT FROM
 WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE JUST
 HOW ABOUT WORKING ON BUILDING
 BRIDGES RATHER THAN CONTINUING
 TO BURN THEM.
 Dana: INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK.
 Jesse: IS OUT THIS WEEK OR
 LAST WEEK?
 Dana: EVERY WEEK.
 Emily: THE SECOND POINT IS
 IT'S INTERESTING PRESIDENT TRUMP
 WENT TO THE COURTS TO BLOCK THE
 SUBPOENA OF THE ACCOUNTING FIRM
 BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE POWER
 OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.
 SAYING THAT THE COURT ORDER
 MATTERS MORE.
 I WILL GET DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
 OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH ERIC
 HOLDER BUT WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED
 WITH THE CONTEMPT ISSUES.
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
 ARREST HIM AND PROSECUTE HIM?
 THE DOJ WOULD DO SO.
 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE --
 Juan: LET IT ALL OUT. WE WANT GREG TO TALK.
 EVERYTHING SHE SAID BUT AT HALF
 SPEED.
 IT WENT FLYING OVER MY HEAD.
 I SWEAR TO GOD.
 DO KNOW I'M TIRED OF?
 I AM TIRED OF THE COLLUSION
 DRAMA QUEENS.
 THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
 ALWAYS TWEETING, LIKE I AM
 SICKENED.
 I'M LITERALLY SHAKING.
 NO, YOU'RE NOT.
 PEOPLE LITERALLY SHAKING, WHEN
 YOU'RE MUGGED OR YOU HEAR
 TERRIBLE NEWS.
 THEY ARE NOT LITERALLY SHAKING.
 THE BEST ANALOGY IS FROM GLENN
 REYNOLDS IN USA TODAY.
 HE COMPARES THE LAST HOLDOUTS OF
 COLLUSION TO A DOOMSDAY CULT.
 DO YOU KNOW, THEY SET THE
 APOCALYPSE DATE AND THEY GET IT
 WRONG SO THEY MOVE IT.
 IT'S A BRILLIANT ANALOGY AND I'M
 STEALING IT FROM HIM.
 WE ARE SEEING THE ARBITRARY
 NATION OF THE WEAPONS BEING USED
 TO GET RID OF TRUMP.
 BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET
 COLLUSION, THEY ARE MOVING TO
 OBSTRUCTION.
 IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
 TO YOUR POINT, IT REALLY IS A
 COOL, A SLOW-MOTION COUP.
 THEY ARE UNDOING THE WILL OF THE
 PEOPLE.
 JUST WIN, BABY, AS AL DAVIS
 WOULD SAY.
 JUST WIN AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
 UNDO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.
 IF YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO
 HAVE ANGRY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING
 TO COME AFTER YOU.
 I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GOING TO BE
 VIOLENT.
 I'M YOU'RE SAYING PEOPLE KNOW
 WHEN YOU'RE STEALING FROM THEM
 AND THIS WOULD BE A STOLEN
 ELECTION.
 YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO
 WIN, BABY.
 Juan: ONE LESS THING FOR
 ALL OF YOU.
 WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS IMPEACHED,
 REPUBLICAN SAID YEAH, HE LIED.
 HE'S A LIAR.
 HE IS DISHONEST.
 HE WAS ORDERING PEOPLE TO DO
 THINGS THAT ARE WRONG.
 IF YOU APPLY THE SAME STANDARD.
 Greg: WE HAVE EVOLVED SINCE
 THEN.
 I HAVE EVOLVED.
 J ALL RIGHT.
 MSNBC UNDER FIRE FOR AMBUSHING
 ROBERT MUELLER OUTSIDE HIS
 CHURCH ON EASTER SUNDAY.
 THAT VIDEO IS NEXT RIGHT HERE ON
 "THE FIVE" FOR YOU TO SEE■

   There was a moment, my son I     believe was about four,
    where he actually asked me       "Mommy what's wrong        with your teeth?"
  If I would've known that I was   gonna be 50 tiier...
    I would've gone into Aspen       Dental much sooner.
   It was a very life changing          experience...
 and it felt like I was me again.
 That's when I realized I hadn't      been for three years.
      At Aspen Dental we're          all about yes.
 Like yes to flexible hours    and payment options.
   Yes to free exam and x-rays
  for new patients without insurance.
 And yes whenever you're  ready to get started,       we are too.
  Call now at 1-800-AspenDental.
  I switched to Liberty Mutual,
       because they let me     customize my insurance.
    And as a fitness junkie,    I customize everything,
   like my bike, and my calves.
    <i> Liberty Mutual customizes</i>       <i> your car insurance,</i>

 [LAUGHTER] Jesse: WANT TO KNOW HOW THE
 MAINSTREAM MEDIA SPENT
 EASTER SUNDAY?
 CHECK OUT THIS DESPICABLE VIDEO
 OF AND MSNBC REPORTER AMBUSHING
 ROBERT MILLER.
 WILL YOU TESTIFY BEFORECONGR?
 NO COMMENTS.
 IF HE WERE ANYONE BUT THE
 PRESIDENT, WOULD MR. TRUMP BE
 INDICTED?
 NOW THAT YOU'VE FINISHED.
 SIR, WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE OUT
 RECOMMENDATION TO COMMERCE ONE
                             <u>HE ?</u> TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 ACCURATELY CHARACTERIZE YOUR
 POSITIONS ON CONSPIRACY AND
 OBSTRUCTION?
 I THINK IT'S ACCURATE TO
 CHARACTERIZE DIRECTOR MUELLER AS
 BEING TIGHT-LIPPED IN RESPONSE
 TO MY QUESTIONS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Jesse: EVEN I, WOULD NOT
 AMBUSH SOMEONE COMING OUT OF
 CHURCH ON EASTER SUNDAY.
 Greg: ARE YOU SURE?
 Jesse: WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT
 OF RULES WITH THOSE AMBUSHES.
 ONE RULE WAS YOU DON'T EVER
  ANYBODY ON A■IGIOUS
 HOLIDAY.
  Greg: THAT IS BIG
 ATHEISTS DON'T HAVE ANY
 PROTECTION.
 Greg: THAT'S NOT FAIR.
 SO I DON'T GO TO CHURCH.
 THAT'S JUST WRONG.
 Jesse: YOU'RE GOING TO GET
 IT, GREG.
 Juan: IT'S A PUBLIC
 SIDEWALK.
 HE'S NOT IHURCH.
 HE CAN ASK THE GUY.S.
 IT IS ONE ANSWER.
 Jesse: I AGREE.
 LISTEN, I'VE GOT PEOPLE COMING
 OUT OF AA MEETINGS.
 Greg: THAT'S TERRIBLE!JesR
 CHILDREN GOT PEOPLE ON
 PRIVATE PROPERTY.
 Greg: YOU ARE WORSE THAN
 THIS REPORTER.
 Jesse: I HAVE NEVER PULLED
 THE TRIGGER ON SOMETHING LIKE
 THIS ON EASTER LEAVING CHURCH.
 Greg: BUT YOU GOT THEM
 OUTSIDE OF AA?
 Jesse: I WAS RUTHLESS, I'M
 NOT GOING TO LIE.
 Dana: YOU DON'T WORK
 WEEKENDS.
 Greg: THAT'S TRUE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Dana: CAN I SAY --
 Greg: I LOVE THAT THEY GAVE
 YOU THIS SEGMENT.
 Juan: JUST BROKE IT DOWN.
 WE NEED YOU TO DEFEND THE GUY.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 Dana: THIS IS ONE OF THE
 REASONS I DIDN'T MAKE IT IN
 LOCAL NEWS.
 BECAUSE I WAS ASKED, THERE WAS A
 MURDER TRIAL AND I WAS SENT AS
 YOUNG DAILY REPORTER A■2 w=
 TO GO TO THE COURTHOUSE AND I
 WAS SUPPOSED TO THE WOMAN
 WHOSE CHILD HAD BEEN KILLED
 RIGHT BEFORE THE TRIAL WAS
 SUPPOSED TO START, I WAS
 OSED TO GET UP TO HER AND
 THEY SAID DON'T COME BACK WITH
 OUT AN INTERVIEW.
 I CIRCLED THREE TIMES AND I SAID
 I'M NOT DOING THAT.
 I WANT HOME AND I CALLED MY DAD
 AND I SAID I THINK I JUST GOT A
 DEGREE IN SUMMING I CAN'T DO.
 ANYWAY, HERE I AM.
 IT'S EASY TO BE HERE IN THE
 I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
 IT.
 Greg: THERE IS A POINT TO
 THAT, AND WHAT YOU WERE SAYING,.
 WHAT WE DO, WE DON'T EVER HAVE
 TO BE FACED WITH THIS SORT OF
 QUESTION EVERY DAY.
 I THINK YOU GET INTO A MIND-SET
 WHERE YOU ACTUALLY DON'T SEE
 WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
 YOU'RE JUST GOING OUT THERE.
 HAVING SAID THAT, I WOULD SAY
 THE MEDIA IS A RELIGION IN NEED
 OF A REFORMATION.
 SOCIAL MEDIAS LIKE THE GUTENBERG
 PRESS.
 AN UNTENABLE SITUATION FOR
 EVERYBODY.
 WE NOW KNOW WHAT'S FAKE AND
 WHAT'S REAL.
 IT'S SO EASY TO CALL EVERYTHING
 OUT, THAT I THINK THE MEDIA HAS
 NO RESPECT ANYMORE.
 Jesse: I THINK THE REASON
 WHY WHY THEY DID THIS, MSNBC
 WANTED TO HUMILIATE ROBERT
 MILLER BIGOTED RACHEL MADDOW WAS
 HUMILIATED HERSELF.
 Juan: OH, STOP.
 YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY TO ME, YOU
 USED TO SAY YOU LIBERALS, YOU
 MADE ROBERT MUELLER YOUR HERO.
 NOW AFTER THE MUELLER REPORT,
 AFTER YOU SPIN, YOU SAY MUELLER
 IS THE HERO.
 MSNBC IS ATTACKING ROBERT
 MUELLER.
 Jesse: I DON'T THINK THEY
 ATTACKED HIM.
 THEY JUST NAILED HIM ON THE
 STREET.
 Juan: PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T
 READ THE MUELLER REPORT ENGAGING
 IN WILLFUL IGNORANCE IN ORDER TO
 MAKE MUELLER THEIR HERO.
 THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.
 GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN YOUR
 PROFESSIONAL CAREER, WHY ARE YOU
 FENDING OUT REPORTER DURING HIS
 DRIVE ON PUBLIC STREETS?
 Jesse: I ALREADY TOLD YOU
 WE HAVE LIKE THREE RULES.
 DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THEIR WAR
 REST?
 NO WEDDINGS, NO FUNERALS.
 NO RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS.
 THAT'S IT.
 I DID EVERYTHING ELSE.
 Juan: JESSE.
 Emily: MUELLER WAS NOT SOME
 HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITY WHERE HE
 EMERGES.
 HE WAS COMING OUT OF EASTER
 SERVICE.
 HE ALREADY -- WE KNOW WHAT HE
 THOUGHT.
 IT WAS IN THE REPORT.
 THE FACT THAT THEY WERE
 CELEBRATING THE QUESTIONS
 AFTERWARDS ON MSNBC, LIKE YES,
 THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE QUESTIONS
 THE PUBLIC WANTED TO KNOW BUT IT
 DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE YOU
 DIDN'T GET ANY ANSWERS.
 THERE WAS NO COMMENTS.
 YOU KNOW YOU WHEN YOU'RE COMING
 OFF THE HEELS OF SOMETHING LIKE
 PEACEFUL LIKE YOGA OR CHURCHn■n.
 I FEEL LIKE, WAY TO RUIN IT.
 Dana: I HAD A FACIAL ON
 SATURDAY AND I GET THE CAR AND
 PETER ASKED ME 20 QUESTIONS
 ABOUT AM I TAKING THE CAR AND I
 WAS GETTING FLUSTERED.
 I SAID I JUST CAME FROM A FACIAL
 WHERE I WAS RELAXED AND NOW
 YOU'RE ASKING ME 20 QUESTIONS.
 Greg: THE THING THAT WE ARE
 OVERLOOKING IS THAT BY GOING
 AFTER MSNBC, WE ARE NOT GOING
 AFTER BRIAN STELTER.
 WHAT?
 TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES ARE
 TELLING BIG LIES.
 RIGHT NOW THE MOST POPULAR ONE
 IS NO OBSTRUCTION.
 THERE IS NO CONSPIRACY FOUND IN
 THE MUELLER REPORT, BUT THERE IS
 NO INTEGRITY EITHER.
 SO WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE PRESS
 IN THIS BROKEN ENVIRONMENT?
 IN PART, OUR ROLE IS TO KEEP
 COLLECTING FACTS, ALL OF THE
 FACTS SO CITIZENS CAN MAKE UP
 THEIR OWN MINDS.
 I THINK IT'S ALSO OUR ROLES WITH
 AN UPPER AND MORALITY.ESPECIALL.
 Greg: [LAUGHS]
 HE'S THE HAIRLESS HALL MONITOR.
 HE JUST APPOINTED HIMSELF THE
 ARBITER OF MORALITY AFTER LAYING
 THE RED CARPET OUT FOR AVENATTI,
 THE MOST AMORAL VERMIN SINCE THE
 INVENTION OF THE COCKROACH.
 HE EMBRACED AVENATTI BECAUSE HE
 DID STELTER'S OWN BIDDING.
 YOU CAN'T SIT ON YOUR SOAPBOX
 BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK.
 YOU CAN'T START LECTURING US
 UNTIL YOU COME CLEAN ABOUT THE
 MISTAKES YOU MADE.

 Dana: ELIZABETHREN
 PROPOSING PERHAPS HER BIGGEST
 POLICY IDEA YET.
 SHE WANTS TO WIPE OUT STUDENT
 LO■ÑÑ■■ÑÑz■Ñ■e■■e4 FOR 42 MILLIN
 AMERICANS.
 SHE EXPLAINS HOW HER PLAN WOULD
 WORK.
 ANYONE WHO'S GOT AN
 OUTSTANDING STUDENT LONE DEBT
 CAN HAVE UP TO $50,000 WORTH OF
 STUDENT LONE DEBT CANCELED OUT
 SO LONG AS THEIR INCOME IS UNDER
 $100,000 AND IT KIND OF STEPPED
 IN UP TO, THERE'S NO HELP FOR
 ANYONE WHOSE FAMILY INCOME IS
 ABOVE 250,000.
 THAT'S IT.
 Dana: HOW WOULD HER OVER
 $1 TRILLION PROPOSAL BE PAID
 FOR?
 A WEALTH TAX ON MILLIONAIRES AND
 BILLIONAIRES.
 I LIKE TALK ABOUT POLICY STUFF.
 SHE IS FLOODING THE ZONE WITH
 POLICY PROPOSALS.
 EVERY DAY.
 YOU CAN'T CATCH UP WITH HER
 BECAUSE SHE'S THROWING THINGS
 OUT THERE.
 IN A GRANITE STATE POLL TODAY,
 SHE'S AT 5%.
 SIX MONTHS AGO IN AUGUST, SHE
 WAS AT 17%.
 SHE HAS LOST THAT MUCH AROUND
 DESPITE THE PROPOSALS.
 Jesse: MAYOR PETE AND
 SANDERS ARE SURGING IN THAT SAME
 POLL.
 I LIKE THE THOUGHT BEHIND IT.
 I DON'T THINK REPUBLICANS SHOULD
 SEE GROUND TO DEMOCRATS.
 REPUBLICANS HAVE TO COME OUT
 WITH THE IDEA THEMSELVES ABOUT
 HOW TO TACKLE STUDENT LOANS DEBT
 BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM.
 HER IDEA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
 YOU CAN'T SEIZE WEALTH FROM
 PEOPLE.
 YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN INCOME TAX
 AND I DON'T THINK SHE REALLY
 CARES IF IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL
 OR NOT.
 IT'S MORE OF A P.R. GIMMICK.
 INSTEAD OF THAT, WHY DON'T THEY
 CREATE A FOUNDATION THAT LARGE
 CORPORATIONS HEN AMERICANS AND
 OTHER FOUNDATIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE
 TO TAX-FREE.
 STUDENTS WITH OVERWHELMING DEBT
 CAN APPLY TO SEE IF THEY CAN
 WIPE OUT SOME OF THAT DEBT FOR
 THEM.
 IT HAS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE
 PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE THE
 PRIVATE SECTOR IS THE ENTITY
 THAT IS SEVERING THE MOST FROM
 STUDENTS WITH OVERWHELMING DEBT
 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MOVING OUT
 OF THEIR PARENTS' BASEMENTS AND
 SPENDING MONEY.
 Dana: AND THEY ARE
 DEFAULTING.
 COULD THIS BE THE MOTHER OF ALL
 MORAL HAZARDS?
 IF THE ONLY ENTITIES ON THE HOOK
 ARE THE TAXPAYERS, THE COST FOR
 COLLEGE IS NOT GOING TO GO DOWN.
 Greg: THIS IS THEFT.
 THIS MONEY ISN'T DISAPPEARING.
 IT'S BEING TAKEN FROM SOMEBODY.
 WHAT ABOUT CARLOS, HOME LOANS,
 HOW ABOUT MY LOAN TO THE PAWN
 SHOP?
 HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT?
 CREDIT CARD DEBT.
 IT DOESN'T HURT THE PEOPLE THAT
 YOU WANT TO HURT, COLLEGES.
 THEY ALREADY MADE THE MONEY.
 YOU WANT THE COLLEGES, WITH
 THEIR BLOATED BUREAUCRACY AND
 INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU WANT THEM TO
 BE POKED.
 LET'S FACE IT.
 BECAUSE THE LOANS WERE SO EASY,
 THAT'S WHAT INFLATED THE
 INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFLATED THE
 TUITION.
 TRIPLED THE TUITION IN OVER TWO
 DECADES BECAUSE THEY GOT THE
 MONEY.
 I AM FOR FREE COLLEGE.
 I WANT COLLEGE TO BE FREE JUST
 SO THE MASSIVE BUREAUCRACIES ARE
 DESTROYING.
 THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT.
 IF CORPORATIONS REJECT THE
 VIRTUE SIGNALING OF ADVANCED
 DEGREES AND EMBRACE ONLINE
 ACADEMIA, ONLINE COLLEGES CAN DO
 IT.
 THAT COULD BE FREE.
 MILITARY SERVICE, PRIORITY OVER
 COLLEGE.
 ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION, TRADE
 SCHOOLS.
 MAKE ELITE DIPLOMAS THAT COST SO
 MUCH MONEY WORTHLESS.
 THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM
 IS THE LOANS ARE TOO EASY AND
 SHE IS SO DESPERATE.
 SHE IS LIKE A CHILD BANGING POTS
 AND PANS IN THE KITCHEN WHERE
 SHE CAN'T GET ENOUGH.
 SHE WANTS NOISE AND IT'S NOT
 WORKING.
 Dana: THIS WASN'T DETAILED
 IN THE PROPOSAL BUT IF YOUR DEBT
 IS FORGIVEN, IT'S LIKE WINNING A
 CAR ON A GAME SHOW.
 YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON IT.
 LET'S SAY YOU GET $150,000
 FORGIVEN, YOU STILL HAVE TO COME
 UP WITH 25% OF THAT TO PAY THE
 TAXES.
 Emily: DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
 SCENE IN "16 CANDLES."
 SHE WAS LIKE BREAKFAST IS
 SERVED.
 IT'S A TOTAL OVERSIMPLIFICATION
 AND MISSING THE POINT.
 WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT ERADICATING
 TUITION, WHAT DO WE THINK THE
 MAJORITY OF TUITION COVERS?
 PENSIONS.
 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS
 BEFORE, THE ENTIRE PENSION
 DEBACLE, SO SHE THINKS ANY TYPE
 OF UNION WOULD GO FOR THIS
 METHOD IT MAKES ANY FISCAL
 ECONOMIC SENSE THAT TWO PLUS TWO
 EQUALS FOUR, HE DOESN'T IN THIS
 CASE.
 IN CALIFORNIA, THIS GENERATION
 IS LITERALLY PAYING FOR THE
 GENUS DECISION OF 10 IN 20 YEARS
 AGO TO ERADICATE EXTRA PAYMENTS
 FOR THEIR PENSION.
 IT IS SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
 THAN SHE'S MAKING IT SEEM.
 SHE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE
 BUSINESSES TO HIRE STUDENTS TO
 HAVE INTERNS, HIRE EMPLOYEES.
 Dana: JUAN, DO YOU THINK
 OTHER DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO
 COME FORWARD WITH SOME SORT OF
 PLAN?
 DOES IT HELP THE PEOPLE WHO
 NEEDED THE MOST?
 Juan: GREG WAS SAYING HE
 WANTS TO HURT THE COLLEGES BUT I
 THINK THE IDEA IS TO HELP
 STUDENTS.
 STUDENTS WHO ALREADY HAVE
 ACCRUED SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND ARE
 OUT OF SCHOOL.
 THEIR PLANS ARE KNOWN PLACE,
 SOME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT TO
 HELP IN THE FUTURE, PEOPLE WOULD
 INCUR FUTURE DEBT.
 THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT
 NOW STRUGGLING WITH STUDENT
 DEBT.
 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS,
 WHATEVER SHE SAID, I THINK IT'S
 REASONABLE TO MY EARS, WHAT
 STRIKES ME IS ORIGINAL PLAN FROM
 THE REPUBLICANS.
 THE REPUBLICANS AREN'T DEBATING
 IT.
 THEY ARE GIVING UP ON THE WHOLE
 IDEA OF RUNNING UP CRAZY TAX
 DEBTS AND DEFICITS.
 TRUMP HAS NO PLAN OR LEASING THE
 DEFICIT RISING EVERY DAY.
 SHE WANTS TO USE THIS MONEY TO
 HELP YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING
 TO MOVE AHEAD.
 BY THE WAY, GREG, THOSE ONLINE
 SCHOOLS, A LOT OF FRAUD.
 WE SAW IT RECENTLY, BY THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION, POINTING OUT
 SECRETARY DeVOS AND OTHERS.
 YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT WHAT'S
 GOOD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
 Greg: THERE'S A LOT OF
 FRAUD IN ALL COLLEGES.
 I THINK ONLINE IS THE WAY TO GO
 HOME.
 AND I HOPE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
 Dana: JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S

 STAGED A HATE CRIME ATTACK AND
 FURTHER, CLAIMING THE DISGRACED

 UP.

 AMOUNT OF TRAUMA EVERYONE WOULD
 SUFFER.
 SOME OF MY SIBLINGS AS WELL AS
 JUSSIE'S PARTNER AND CLOSEST

 WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THIS IN
 ADDITION TO THE LUDICROUS ASPECT
 WAS THE FACT THAT IF THEY'RE
 TRYING TO START A PAPER TRAIL OF
 THERE BEING A PHYSICAL
 MANIFESTATION OF DAMAGES IF THEY
 ARE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A
 LAWSUIT BY JUSSIE SMOLLETT
 AGAINST THE CITY OF CHICAGO, I
 JUST HOPE THEY ARE NOT.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK, GREG?
 Greg: EVEN HAVE TO HAVE A
 TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE
 INVOLVED IN THIS FRAME UP, LIKE
 10,000 PEOPLE.
 AS SOMEONE WHO DOES EXPERIENCE
 NIGHT TERRORS, I EXPERIENCE THEM
 WITHOUT EVER PERPETRATING A
 MASSIVE HOAX WHICH EMBARRASSES
 YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COWORKERS,
 PEOPLE WHO DEFENDED YOU.
 I CAN SAY GO SCREW YOURSELF.
 HE RAN UP HIS VICTIM DEBT CARD.
 EVERYONE HAS A VICTIM DEBT CARD.
 HE WANTS MORE.
 HE WANTS TO GET EXTENSION
 YOU'RE NOT■NY MORE FROM
 ME.
 BY THE WAY, NIGHT TERRORS, THEY
 ARE BAD.
 I HAVE HAD THEM.
 Emily: WHAT'S THE
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NIGHT
 TERROR AND ARE NORMAL NIGHTMARE?

 Dana: THANK YOU.
 Jesse: I'M NOT GOING TO
 MAKE A REQUEST TO MAKE AN
 ANALOGY.
 SMOLLETT IS THE MEDIA.
 THEY BOTH PERPETUATED A HOAX.
 THEY BOTH GOT CAUGHT AND INSTEAD
 OF BEING CONTRITE, THEY ARE
 DOUBLING DOWN ON THE HOAX.
 THEY NEED TO LAY LOW, STOP
 HAVING THEIR TEAM RIGHT BEDS AND
 WAIT UNTIL IT BLOWS OVER.
 Emily: ISN'T THIS THE
 BROTHER JUSSIE SMOLLETT
 PRETENDED TO BE WHEN HE WAS
 PULLED OVER?
 Dana: THANK YOU, EXACTLY.
 AND KIM FOXX, SHE'S THE ONE WHO
 SAID IN THE TEXT MESSAGE THAT
 WAS REVEALED LAST WEEK THAT HE
 IS A LIAR.
 SHE SAYS THAT HE LIED TO THE
 COPS.
 I WOULD SAY TO THE BROTHER, NEXT
 TIME YOU THINK YOUR BROTHER IS
 HAVING A NIGHT TERROR AND YOU
 ARE WITNESSING IT, HE IS AN
 ACTOR.
 Emily: TOTALLY.
 JUAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 Juan: IT'S NATURAL FOR HER
 BROTHER TO STAND UP FOR ANOTHER
 BROTHER.
 IT'S HIS BROTHER AND HE FELT HE
 SHOULD STAND UP AND SAY YOU KNOW
 IT, GIVE MY BROTHER THE BENEFIT
 OF THE DOUBT.
 Emily: DO YOU THINK HE
 BELIEVES THAT YOUR DO YOU THINK
 HE'S JUST STANDING UP FOR HIM?
 Juan: I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE
 I'M NOT IN HIS HEAD BUT I THINK
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT CONTINUES TO SAY
 THAT IT HAPPENED AS HE SAYS.
 OBVIOUSLY THE CHICAGO POLICE
 DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.
 EVEN CHARLES BARKLEY DOESN'T SEE
 IT THAT WAY.
 Dana: EVEN KIM FOXX.
 Juan: I'M SAYING JUSSIE
 SMOLLETT HASN'T CHANGED.
 THE POLICE, PROSECUTION.
 HE'S NOT FACING CHARGES.
 AT SOME POINT YOU'VE GOT TO
 THINK WHY IS THE SYSTEM, WHY IS
 THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUING TO
 PURSUE A MAN WHO REALLY HAS BEEN
 CHARGED WITH NOTHING?
 THEY HAVE THEIR INVESTIGATION,
 NO CHARGES.
 Greg: WAIT, ARE YOU TALKING
 ABOUT TRUMP?
 [LAUGHTER]
 Juan: THERE WAS A MISTAKE.
