WATCHING & RUHLE, LIVE ON MSNBC. (KICKSTART MY HEART BY MOTLEY CRUE) (sound of can hitting bag and bowl) <i> Always there in crunch time.</i> <i> July Fourth lands on a Thursday</i> “I got it!” <i> So bookers are booking</i> <i> a one, two, three,</i> <i> that's a four day weekend</i> <i> “Awesome”</i> <i> And with getaway deals</i> <i> on accommodation starting </i> <i> from 15 percent off,</i> <i> you can be a Booker </i> <i> at Booking dot com</i> If you have moderate to severe psoriasis, <i> on accommodation starting </i> <i> from 15 percent off,</i> little things can be a big deal. That's why there's Otezla. Otezla is not a cream. It's a pill that treats plaque psoriasis differently. With Otezla, 75% clearer skin is achievable. Don't use if you're allergic to Otezla. It may cause severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Otezla is associated with an increased risk of depression. Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or suicidal thoughts or if these feelings develop. Some people taking Otezla reported weight loss. Your doctor should monitor your weight and may stop treatment. Upper respiratory tract infection and headache may occur. Tell your doctor about your medicines and if you're pregnant or planning to be. Ready to treat differently with a pill? Otezla. Show more of you. Did you know even the cleanest looking cars can smell musty? That's because odors trapped in your car's soft surfaces get released, and are then circulated by your AC system. To stop the cycle of odors try Febreze CAR Vent Clips. Febreze stops the circulation of musty air by trapping and eliminating lingering odor molecules for up to 30 days of fresh, clean air. Plus, they come in a range of scents including extra light. Stop the cycle of odors in your car with Febreze CAR Vent Clips.
