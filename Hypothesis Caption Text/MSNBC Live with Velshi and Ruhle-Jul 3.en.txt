 McCONNELL IS WATCHING TODAY. THANK YOU ALL, AS THIS 4th OF
 JULY, WE ARE CELEBRATING
 AMERICA, THAT DOES IT FOR THIS
 EDITION OF "ANDREA MITCHELL
 REPORTS."
 HERE IS ALI VELSHI FROM "VELSHI
 & RUHLE."
 HELLO EVERYONE, THE CRISIS AT
 THE BORDER, WE GOT NEW DETAILS
 ABOUT HOW CHILDREN ARE BEING
 TREATED AND U.S. CUSTODY WOULD
 BE CONSIDERED AS ABUSE IF IT
 HAPPENS AT HOME.
 PLUS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE'S
 CUTTING PRESCRIPTION DRUG
 PRICES.
 THOUSANDS ARE SKYROCKETING.
 WE'LL DIG INTO THE NUMBERS FOR
 YOU.
 MILITARY TANKS HAVE ARRIVED ON
 THE NATIONAL MALL FOR THE
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 4th OF JULY
 CELEBRATION.
 WE'LL LOOK AT THE COSTS AND
 CONCERNS FROM THE PENTAGON.
 TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
 INSISTING HIS FIGHT FOR
 ADDING -- THE NEWS REPORTS ABOUT
 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DROPPING
 ITS QUEST TO CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION ON THE CENSUS IS
 INCORRECT.
 WILBUR ROSS WHO SAYS 24 HOURS
 AGO THIS.
 "THE CENSUS BURR RHEE HAS
 STARTED THE PROCESS OF PRINTING
 THE QUESTIONNAIRES WITHOUT THE
 QUESTION.
 MY FOCUS AND THAT OF THE BUREAU
 AND THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT IS TO
 CONDUCT A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE
 CENSUS.
 FOLLOWING THE SUPREME COURT'S
 DECISION TO BLOCK THE QUESTIONS
 FROM 2020 CENSUS.
 KELLY O'DONELL IS JOINING ME.
 THIS ONE IS A TRICKY ONE.
 THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY
 HAS TO PRINT THE CENSUS AND THE
 CENSUS ACTUALLY HAS TO GO OUT.
 THIS ONE SEEMS TO BE EASY TO
 IDENTIFY WHAT THE STORY ACTUALLY
 IS.
 WHY ARE THE PRESIDENT AND THE
 CONGRESS DEPARTMENT IS NOT ON
 THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THIS.
 YOU CAN ARGUE THERE ARE TWO
 DIFFERENT TRACKS.
 THERE IS THE PRACTICAL PIECE
 HAVING TO PRINT THE CENSUS AND
 IN THIS CASE NO QUESTIONS ABOUT
 CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE WHO
 PARTICIPATE.
 2020 IS KNOCKING ON OUR DOOR.
 WILBUR ROSS AND SECRETARY'S OWN
 NAME.
 YOU READ THE STATEMENT.
 THIS IS CLEARLY COMING FROM THE
 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE.
 SO WHERE IS THE SECOND LEVEL,
 YOU COULD CONTINUE THE LEGAL
 CHALLENGE AND MAKE IT AN ISSUE
 AND COULD BE RESOLVED AT A LATER
 DATE OR ARGUABLY YOU COULD SAY
 REPRINT THE PORTIONS OF THE
 CENSUS OR THE NEXT CENSUS.
 IT APPEARS TO BE POLITICAL
 MESSAGING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
 TAKING A STRONG POSITION ON
 THIS.
 JUST MONDAY HE WAS ASKED ABOUT
 THIS QUESTION IN THE OVAL OFFICE
 WOULD WE DELAY THE CENSUS.
 HE SAID HE WAS STRONGLY LOOKING
 AT THAT.
 THE PRESIDENT WANTING TO STICK
 WITH THAT POSITION BELIEING HE
 EXPLAINS IN THE OVAL THAT THIS
 IS AS QUESTION THAT HE BELIEVES
 IT IS APPROPRIATE AND THE
 COUNTRY'S RIGHTS TO KNOW WHO
 AMONG THOSE PARTICIPATING IS A
 CITIZEN WHO'S NOT.
 HE DID NOT LEAVE OPEN THE
 POSSIBILITY FOR NON CITIZENS WHO
 HAVE PERMANENT LEGAL STATUS IN
 THE UNITED STATES OR THOSE UNDER
 PROTECTED STATUS LIKE ASYLUM
 SEEKER.
 HE JUST HAD EITHER/OR.
 THE PRESIDENT IS STILL SAYING HE
 WANTS TO FIGHT THIS FIGHT.
 THERE IS A WAY FOR BOTH TO BE
 TRUE BUT WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD
 FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IS THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAVE A DIFFERENCE ON
 THE ACTUAL PRINTING PART OF IT.
 IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SHIP IS
 ABOUT TO SAIL FROM ONE OF HIS
 CLOSEST ADVISERS, WILBUR ROSS,
 THAT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
 KELLY O'DONELL FOR US AT THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
 CELEBRATING THE ACQUITTAL OF A
 NAVY SEAL ACCUSED OF MURDERING
 AN ISIS FIGHTER.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS
 CONGRATULATIONS TO NAVY SEAL
 EDDIE GALLAGHER.
 YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH MUCH
 TOGETHER.
 GLAD THAT I CAN HELP.
 HE POSED FOR A PICTURE WITH THE
 CORPSE.
 HE WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY ON SIX
 CRIMINAL CHARGES, HE WAS FOUND
 GUILTY POSING WITH THE PHOTO'S
 CASUALTIES.
 HE WAS THE ONE WHO KILLED THE
 BOY BY BLOCKING HIS BREATHING
 TUBE IN AN ACT OF MERCY.
 JOINING ME NOW FROM SAN DIEGO,
 STEVE PATTPATTERSON.
 WHAT HELP IS THE PRESIDENT
 TALKING ABOUT IN THAT TWEET?
 Reporter: THE PRESIDENT IS
 REFERRING TO AN ACT THAT
 OCCURRED IN THE PAST.
 THERE WAS ABOUT A NINE-MONTH
 PERIOD AFTER GALLAGHER WAS
 ARRESTED FOR THESE WAR CRIMES IN
 2017 DUTY IN MOSUL, IRAQ, WHERE
 HE WAS TAKEN TO A MILITARY BRIG,
 ARRESTED IN THE FALL AND I
 BELIEVE RESIDENCE TAKEN AND
 CONFINED THERE FOR A PERIOD OF
 NEARLY A YEAR, ABOUT NINE
 MONTHS.
 THE PRESIDENT TAKES CREDIT FOR
 MOVING HIM OUT OF THE BRIG AND
 BACK HOME SAYING THAT THE BRIG
 IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE A
 FLIGHT RISK OR HAVE SIGNIFICANT
 RISK OF HARMING SOMEONE OR
 THEMSELVES OR OBVIOUSLY LEAVING
 THE COUNTRY.
 HIS ARGUMENT WAS THAT GALLAGHER
 WAS AT RISK OF DOING NONE OF
 THAT.
 HE REFERENCED THIS AS HE DOES
 WITH MOST EVERYTHING IN A TWEET
 SAYING "IN HONOR OF HIS PAST
 SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY, EDDIE
 GALLAGHER WILL SOON BE MOVED TO
 A LESS RESTRICTIVE REFINEMENT.
 THE PROCESS WILL MOVE QUICKLY."
 WE SPOKE TO MEMBERS OF
 GALLAGHER'S DEFENSE TEAM ON THE
 WAY INTO COURT THIS MORNING.
 THEY WERE PRAISING AND THANKING
 PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR DOING THIS.
 THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT THAT HE
 ALLOWED ALL THIS PRESS TO USHER
 IN BECAUSE OF HIS EXPOSURE TO
 THE CASE.
 SO THEY'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE
 ATTENTION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
 GIVEN THIS CASE AND OBVIOUSLY
 FOR WHATEVER HE DID TO MOVE
 GALLAGHER FROM CONFINEMENT TO
 HOME SO THEY CAN PREPARE FOR THE
 TRIAL THAT WE JUST EXPERIENCED.
 STEV PATTERSON FOR US IN LOS
 ANGELES.

 THE RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE,
 SEVERAL CANDIDATES ARE
 CAMPAIGNING IN IOWA.
 BIDEN ANNOUNCED JUST RAISED
 $21.5 MILLION IN THE SECOND
 QUARTER ALONE.
 THIS IS KAMALA HARRIS, A NEW
 POLL SHOWS HARRIS IS UP 13
 POINTS IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS
 AND FRONT RUNNER BIDEN IS DOWN 8
 POINTS.
 HARRIS IS RESISTANTS AT 20% AND
 BIDEN AT 22%.
 SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN AND
 BERNIE SANDERS FOLLOWED.
 WHEN VOTERS WERE ASKED WHO HAS
 THE BEST CHANCE OF WINNING
 AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP, BIDEN
 MAINTAINS A STRONG 42% AND
 HARRIS AT 14%.
 THE BIGGEST JUMP AGAINST BELONG
 TO SENATOR HARRIS.
 SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS HOLDS
 ONTO SECOND PLACE.
 JOINING ME NOW FROM IOWA, OUR
 ROAD WARRIORS, MIKE, YOU ARE
 FOLLOWING JOE BIDEN, LET'S TALK
 ABOUT THE SECOND QUARTER FOR HIM
 IN TERMS OF FUND RAISING
 COMPARES TO OTHER CANDIDATES WE
 KNOW SO FAR.
 Reporter: THE DOWNSIDE OF
 BEING THE FRONT RUNNER IN THAT
 DEBATE, JOE BIDEN PUT ON
 DEFENSIVE BY SOME OF HIS
 OPPONENTS.
 AS HE ARRIVED TODAY SINCE THE
 DEBATE A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOW OF
 FORCE FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN

 ANNOUNING THE SECOND QUARTER
 NUMBER.
 IT IS NOT AS MUCH AS PETE
 BUTTIGIEG RAISING MORE THAN
 $25 MILLION.
 BERNIE SANDERS WITH A BIG NUMBER
 OF $18 MILLION.
 THAT'S MORE ON A CURVE DAY BASES
 THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN POINTS OUT.
 I WILL READ A FEW OF THESE
 STATISTICS HIGHLIGHTED BINOMIAL
 Y BIDEN.
 97% OF ALL DONATIONS ARE FROM
 GRASS ROOT DONORS, AMOUNTS OF
 LESS THAN $200 OR LESS.
 THEY HAVE MORE THAN 256,000
 DONORS.
 OBVIOUSLY, ALI, AS BIDEN, HAVING
 TO DEAL WITH THAT TENSE DEBATE
 EXCHANGE WITH KAMALA HARRIS.
 THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT GOING
 ANYWHERE.
 A REMINDER FROM THE BIDEN
 CAMPAIGN AS WELL.
 HIS DOLLAR IS GOING LONGER
 BECAUSE HE GOT UNIVERSAL NAME
 ID.
 HE DOES NOT NEED TO SPEND THAT
 NAME ON TV ADS ESTABLISHING TO
 HIS VOTERS.
 HE CAN INVEST IT ALL IN HIS
 GRASS ROOTS.
 VAUGHAN HILLIARD, YOU ARE
 COVERING KAMALA HARRIS' EVENT IN
 IOWA TODAY.
 BIDEN CONTINUES TO LEAD WITH 24%
 AND HARRIS AT SECOND PLACE AT

 WHAT'S HER PLAN TO CLOSE THE GAP
 AND KEEP THE MOMENTUM.
 IT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
 KAMALA HARRIS TENDS TO HAVE
 MOMENTS AND SHE GOT THE FILL UP
 THE SPACE IN BETWEEN THOSE
 MOMENTS TO KEEP THAT MOMENTUM
 GOING.
 YEAH, YOU ARE FILLING THE
 SPACE BY CAMPAIGNING.
 SHE'S HERE IN DES MOINES.
 SHE WILL BE APPEARING HERE AT
 THIS PARK BEHIND US HERE IN JUST
 ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE SHE HEADS
 OVER THE WESTERN PART OF THE
 STATE.
 SHE WILL HEAD THE TV MARKET IN
 OMAHA OVER THERE.
 ON FRIDAY, SHE'S HIT IOWA,
 TELEVISION MARKET.
 THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLANS
 TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING AND
 NOT LET UP.
 THEY HAVE NOT RELEASE THEIR
 TOTALS.
 SHE JUMPED IN BEFORE ANYBODY
 ELSE AND RAISING $12 MILLION IN
 THAT FIRST QUARTER.
 COMPARES TO MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG
 AND JOE BIDEN WHO JUMPED INTO
 THIS RACE LATER ON.
 THIS IS ABOUT PAINTING CONTRASTS
 AT THIS POINT.
 KAMALA HARRIS SHOWS SHE WAS
 WILLING TO DRAW CONTRASTS
 BETWEEN HERSELF AND OTHER
 CANDIDATES TAKE ON JOE BIDEN ON
 THE ISSUE OF RACE AND BUSSING
 AND ON THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
 DEPORTATION AT THE DEBATE AND
 THE QUESTION IS GOING FORWARD,
 TO WHAT EXTENT WILL SHE CONTINUE
 TO PRESS THE CASE SINCE THEY
 PROSECUTED THE CASE AGAINST HER.
 THAT STARTS HERE ON THE CAMPAIGN
 TRAIL.
 SHE'S GOT TWO EVENTS TODAY
 BEFORE HEADING ON ACROSS IOWA.
 SHE WILL BE IN NEW ORLEANS AND
 ON SATURDAY, BEFORE GOING TO
 SOUTH CAROLINA ON SUNDAY AND
 MONDAY.
 ALI.
 WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN DOING TO
 BOOST MOMENTUM AND WHAT'S GOING
 ON IN IOWA FOR SANDERS?
 Reporter: WE HAVE SENATOR
 SANDERS ABOUT TO OPEN UP THE
 FIELD OFFICE HERE IN IOWA CITY.
 IT IS AN EXAMPLE HOW THE
 CAMPAIGN WANTS TO FOCUS ON WHAT
 THEY CALL GROUND GAME.
 AS WE POINT OUT THESE POLLS,
 HE'S POINTING OUT SEVERAL MORE
 SHOWING SANDERS CLOSING THE GAP
 WITH BIDEN.
 THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE SENATOR
 SANDERS ON THIS TRIP GOING AND
 PARTICIPAING IN THESE RETAIL
 EVENTS.
 HE'S DOING ICE CREAM SOCIALS AND
 MARCHING IN 4th OF JULY PARADES
 AND TRYING TO HAVE INTERACTIONS
 WITH VOTERS.
 RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE ABOUT 43
 STAFFERS.
 THE CAMPAIGN NOTES THAT'S LOWER
 THAN SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPAIGNS
 OUT THERE.
 THEY HIGHLIGHT THEIR 25,000
 VOLUNTEERS WHO STAFFERS ARE
 GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOBILIZE AND
 FOLKS ARE GOING TO KNOCK ON
 DOORS AND MAKE CALLS.
 THAT'S WHY EVENTS LIKE THIS ARE
 HAPPENING.
 THESE ARE RECRUITING EVENTS AND
 HOPING TO PULL IN VOLUNTEERS AND
 PEOPLE TO SUPPORT HIM COME THAT
 CAUCUS.
 THANKS THE THREE OF YOU, OUR
 ROAD WARRIORS ON THE CAMPAIGN
 TRAIL.
 WE ARE LEARNING MORE OF THE
 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IMMIGRATION
 POLICIES WHICH MANY CRITICS SAY
 CROSSES LINES OF ETHICS AND
 HUMAN RIGHTS AND BASIC DEDECENC.

 Going to the Shawn Mendes Verizon UP concert
 was like an out of body experience.
   We were right in front of him. Dead center. Front row.
 'Cause actually, Zarmina, you touched Shawn Mendes.
             Yeah, I touched him! She touched Shawn Mendes!
             He like held my hand             for a while.
               And then we got               to meet him after,               which was like...
 Another surprise.                            Yeah.
   We love Verizon even more now.

    your rate after the other    car got a scratch so small
         you coulda fixed          it with a pen.
    Maybe you should take that    pen and use it to sign up

 THIS WEEK WE ARE GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING INSIDE
 DETENTION CENTERS.
 THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
 SECURITY'S OFFICE OF THE
 INSPECTOR GENERAL TOUTED BORDER
 FACILITIES AND RELEASED BLUNT
 FINDINGS.
 ABOUT 3,400 DETAINEES WERE HELD
 LONGER THAN 72 HOURS.
 THAT'S THE GUIDELINES FOR
 MAXIMUM HOLDING TIME.
 1500 OF THEM WERE HELD FOR MORE
 THAN TEN DAYS AND 826 CHILDREN
 HELD LONGER THAN 72 HOURS
 LIMITS.
 THAT REPRESENTS OF 31% OF THE
 CHILDREN WHO WERE HELD OF CUSTOM
 AND BORDER PATROL.
 REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ALLOW
 DETAINEES TO SHOWER WITHIN 72
 HOURS TO BE MADE, SOME DULLS
 WERE UNABLE TO SHOWER UP TO A
 MONTH.
 DETAINEES WERE GIVEN WET WIPES
 FOR PERSONAL HYGIENE AND MANY
 GOT SANDWICHES.
 CHILDREN RECEIVING HOT MEALS
 WERE NOT BEING MET.
 DETAINEES WERE HELD IN OVER
 CROWDED CELLS FOR UP TO A MONTH.
 ONE MANAGER DESCRIBES THE
 SITUATION AS "TICKING TIME
 BOMB."
 MANY VISITED THE FACILITY
 INCLUDING ALEXANDER
 OCASIO-CORTEZ TOOK TO TWITTER TO
 REPORT ON THE CONDITIONS.
 THEY REPORTED MIGRANTS WORKING
 ODD HOURS FOR NO REASON.
 AND A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
 ORDER QUOTED SEVERAL CHILDREN'S
 INTERVIEW SAYING WE ARE IN A
 METAL CAVE, I AM SO HUNGRY AND
 LIGHTS ARE ON ALL THE TIME AND I
 HAVE NEVER BEEN OFFERED TO
 SHOWER.
 GABE GUTIERREZ TALKED TO A
 PEDIATRICIAN WHO TREATED SOME OF
 THE CHILDREN.
 HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.
 CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE IN A
 PLACE WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE
 ACCESS TO HUMAN BASIC NEEDS OR
 IF THEY ARE SICK TO MEDICAL
 PROVIDER.
 IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR
 HEALTH IN THE FUTURE.
 JOINING ME IS JACOB SOBOROFF.
 YES, THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S
 CALLING ON THE OFFICE OF
 PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
 WITHIN DHS TO INVESTIGATE, WHAT
 THEY NORMALLY INVESTIGATE WHICH
 IS MISCONDUCT AND A LACK OF
 STANDARDS INSIDE THE APARTMENT
 BEING HELD.
 WHAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY SHOCKING
 AND DEHUMANIZING LANGUAGE THAT
 WAS BEING USED BY THE FOLKS THAT
 WERE INSIDE THE GROUP AND A
 GROUP OF LARGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE,
 I THINK 9500 PEOPLE BUT ULTIMATE
 COME DOWN TO THE AX AND THE
 LANGUAGE USED BY THE SPECIFIC
 AGENTS IF INDEED THEY WERE
 ACTING CURRENT BORDER PATROL
 AGENTS AS THE TIME THEY USE
 THOSE MESSAGES.
 A LEGAL BATTLE OVER ASYLUM
 SEEKERS, CAN YOU TELL US MORE
 ABOUT THAT AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR
 PEOPLE AT THE BORDER AND THESE
 DETENTION FACILITIES?
 ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR WANTED
 TO HOLD ASYLUM SEEKERS IN
 CUSTODY WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO
 BAIL THEMSELVES OUT.
 FRANKLY HOLD THEM IN DETENTION
 FOR DEPENDENCY FOR THEIR ASYLUM
 HEARING.
 ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DETER
 MIGRATION IN THE COUNTRY, IF YOU
 COME HERE, TRY TO DETER ASYLUM,
 WE'LL LOCK YOU UP.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ASYLUMS,
 NOT CRIMINALS.
 THE JUDGE SIDED AGAINST ATTORNEY
 BARR HERE IN THAT CASE.
 ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT BE ABLE
 TO LOCK PEOPLE UP ONLY BECAUSE
 THEY WANT TO SEEK ASYLUM.
 THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED
 OF A CHILD WHO DIED AFTER
 SPENDING TIME IN CUSTODY.
 WHAT DO WE KNOW FROM THIS FROM
 THE AUTOPSY?

 ULTIMATELY THIS CHILD DIED,
 SEVERAL DISEASES AND PARASITES
 AND WHAT THE LAWYER IS ALLEGING
 NOW THAT THE AUTOPSY IS OUT,
 THIS CHILD SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
 TREATMENT BEFORE HE AND HIS
 MOTHER WERE SENT TO A HOSPITAL
 ONCE THEY WERE DETAINED BY
 CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION.
 CPD WERE TAUTING FOR SOME TIME.
 SINCE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
 BEGAN, SIX CHILDREN HAVE DIED IN
 CUSTODY.
 THIS IS MORE DETAILS OF ONE OF
 THOSE CASES SPECIFICALLY AND IT
 RAISES A LOT OF RED FLAGS ABOUT
 WHY THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT
 GETTING TREATMENTS SOONER.
 WE SEE ALL OF THESE OVER
 CROWDING CONDITIONS AND ALL
 CONDITIONS OF CHILDREN LIKE THIS
 ARE BEING HELD IN.
 WHY ARE THEY NOT GETTING HELP
 SOONER?
 "THE DAILY BEAST" IS
 REPORTING I.C.E. TOLD "HAPPY
 HUNTING."
 TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
 "HAPPY HUNTING" SUPPOSED TO
 HAPPEN BACK IN 2017.
 THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED USE OF
 DEHUMANIZING PHRASE OF HAPPY
 HUNTING.
 OUR COLLEAGUE HAS ALSO REPORTED
 THAT THE PHRASE HAPPY HUNTING
 WAS USED BY BORDER PATROL
 AGENTS, WE'LL BE DOING RANDOM
 SPOT CHECKS ON GREYHOUND BUSES
 AND OTHER MODES OF
 TRANSPORTATIONS.
 SEARCHES ON PUBLIC
 TRANSPORTATION.
 THE IDEA THAT WE'LL SEE IN
 FACEBOOK REPORTS NOW OF
 DEHUMANIZING LANGUAGE TOWARDS
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND
 IMMIGRANTS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT,
 I.C.E. AGENTS ARE SAYING HAPPY
 HUNTING WHEN IT COMES TO
 TRACKING DOWN.
 AND BORDER PATROL AGENTS SAID
 THE EXACT SAME THING AND THE
 NORTHEAST OF THE UNITED STATES,
 FAR FROM THE BORDER CERTAINLY
 SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A CULTURE
 OF USING THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE
 WITHIN CPD AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN
 A RESPONSE.
 JACOB SOBOROFF, THANK YOU FOR
 YOUR REPORTING IN LOS ANGELES.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
 POLITICIZING THE NATIONAL 4th OF
 JULY CELEBRATION.
 WE'LL LOOK AT HIS PLANS AND THE
 COST FOR THE FESTIVITIES.
 YOU ARE WATCHING "VELSHI &
 RUHLE," LIVE ON MSNBC.
                       WATCHING & RUHLE," LIVE ON MSNBC.

       (KICKSTART MY HEART         BY MOTLEY CRUE)



      (sound of can hitting          bag and bowl)
   <i> Always there in crunch time.</i> <i> July Fourth lands on a Thursday</i>
            “I got it!”
     <i> So bookers are booking</i>
       <i> a one, two, three,</i>
    <i> that's a four day weekend</i>
            <i> “Awesome”</i>
     <i> And with getaway deals</i>
   <i> on accommodation starting </i>      <i> from 15 percent off,</i>
      <i> you can be a Booker </i>       <i> at Booking dot com</i>
 If you have moderate to severe psoriasis,
   <i> on accommodation starting </i>      <i> from 15 percent off,</i> little things can be a big deal.
 That's why there's Otezla.
 Otezla is not a cream.
 It's a pill that treats plaque psoriasis differently.
 With Otezla, 75% clearer skin is achievable.
 Don't use if you're allergic to Otezla.
 It may cause severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.
 Otezla is associated with an increased risk of depression.
 Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression
 or suicidal thoughts or if these feelings develop.
 Some people taking Otezla reported weight loss.
 Your doctor should monitor your weight and may stop treatment.
 Upper respiratory tract infection
 and headache may occur.
 Tell your doctor about your medicines
 and if you're pregnant or planning to be.
 Ready to treat differently with a pill?
 Otezla. Show more of you.

  Did you know even the cleanest  looking cars can smell musty?
 That's because odors trapped in     your car's soft surfaces
    get released, and are then  circulated by your AC system.
    To stop the cycle of odors
   try Febreze CAR Vent Clips.
  Febreze stops the circulation           of musty air
   by trapping and eliminating     lingering odor molecules
        for up to 30 days       of fresh, clean air.
    Plus, they come in a range of scents including extra light.
     Stop the cycle of odors         in your car with     Febreze CAR Vent Clips.
 WELCOME BACK TO "VELSHI & RUHLE."
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PREPARING HIS
 "SALUTE TO AMERICA" EVENT.
 IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF
 CELEBRATION THAN AMERICA IS USED
 TO.
 TANKS AND OTHERS WILL BE USED.
 THE PRESIDENT'S EVENT WILL TAKE
 PLACE AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
 HE'LL GIVE REMARKS DESCRIBE AS
 UPLIFTING AND PATRIOTIC BUT NOT
 POLITICAL.
 JOINING ME NOW, OUR
 CORRESPONDENT KOURTNEY CUBY.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LODGISTIC
 OF THE MILITARY DISPLAY.
 WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WE HAVE
 SOMETHING LIKE AN ABRAMS TANK
 THAT WEIGHS TONS AND TONS.
 YOU CAN'T DRIVE IT DOWN THE
 STREET.
 IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR LARGE
 MILITARY VEHICLES TO BE MOVED.
 SO THAT'S WHAT THEY DID HERE.
 THEY BROUGHT THESE TANKS UP FROM
 GEORGIA, VIA RAIL AND THEY STUCK
 THEM ON FLAT BEDS AND DROVE THEM
 INTO THE CITY BECAUSE THEY WERE
 SO CONCERNED OF THE WEIGHT BUT
 ALSO THE TREADS.
 THE TREADS CAN TEAR UP THE
 STREETS.
 THERE IS A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF
 HOW ARE MILITARY LEADERS
 REACTING TO THIS.
 THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONCERNS OF
 MILITARY OFFICIALS WE HAVE
 SPOKEN TO SINCE THE IDEA OF THIS
 PARADE CAME UP AND MAKING IT
 DEDICATED TO THE MILITARY.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE
 PENTAGON LAWYERS REVIEWED THE
 PLAN AND THEY APPROVED IT.
 THEY SAID THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE
 THING FOR THE U.S. MILITARY TO
 PARTICIPATE IN AND BE APART OF.
 THE MILITARY HAD A PROBLEM
 WITH IT, WOULD THEY BE COMPEL TO
 THE SAME PEOPLE?
 NO.
 IF THEY HAD A PROBLEM AND IT WAS
 CONSIDERED TO BE AN ILLEGAL  A
 JUDGMENT THAT WOULD BE A
 PROBLEM, BRINGING IN A POLITICAL
 REALM THAT IN SOME WAY BE A
 CONFLICT OF INTERESTS BEFORE
 THEM.
 IT IS NOT.
 SO THE MILITARY IS
 PARTICIPATING.
 THERE IS SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT
 WHY IS THAT SOME OF THE MORE
 SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE JOINT
 CHIEFS ARE NOT ATTENDING LIKE
 ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MILLIE
 OR GENERAL MILLER.
 WELL, WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY
 NUMEROUS MILITARY OFFICIALS WE
 HAVE BEEN ASKING ALL WEEK WHO'S
 GOING TO BE ATTENDING.
 THIS PARADE AND A LOT OF THESE
 PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE PLANS.
 SOME OF THEM PLAN TO BE OUT OF
 TOWN OR BE ON LEAVE.
 4th OF JULY IS NOT A TRADITIONAL
 MILITARY HOLIDAY.
 A LOT OF THESE GUYS PLAN TO TAKE
 TIME OFF, ALI.
 COURTNEY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
 REPORTING ON THIS.
 JOINING US NOW, CONGRESSMAN
 CISNERO.
 HE'S A VETERAN HIMSELF.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU FOR
 JOINING US.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
 AS YOU HEARD CONCERNS THAT
 THE PRESIDENT'S 4th OF JULY
 CELEBRATION IS HEAVY ON
 PAGEANTRY AND COULD FEEL MORE OF
 A CAMPAIGN TACTIC.
 WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS?
 THERE IS ALWAYS A PARADE.
 THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE A BIT
 MORE MILITARY COMPONENT AND A
 BIT MORE --
 THE 4th OF JULY OF SHOULD BE
 ABOUT CELEBRATING OUR DEMOCRACY
 AND INDEPENDENCE.
 WE HAVE VETERANS' DAY AND I
 THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT HE'S DOING
 IS TURNING THIS EVENT INTO A
 SPECTACLE.
 THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

 NEED.
 A LOT OF THE GENERALS ARE NOT
 GOING TO BE THERE BECAUSE THEY
 MADE PLANS UNFORTUNATELY FOR
 SERVICE MEMBERS THAT WILL HAVE
 TO BE THERE WITH THE TANKS.
 THEY HAVE TO BE THERE WITH THE
 AIRCRAFTS FOR THE FLY OVER.
 NOW THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT HERE
 FOR THE PARADE INSTEAD OF
 SPENDING WITH THEIR FAMILY AND
 FRIENDS.
 WE ARE HEARING THE DMZ DID
 NOT GET ANY TICKETS TO THE
 PRESIDENT'S EVENT.
 WE HEARD KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYS
 IT IS A PUBLIC EVENT.
 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?
 I KNOW I WAS NOT OFFERED ANY
 TICKETS.
 THIS IS WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS
 DOING.
 HE'S TURNING IT INTO A CAMPAIGN
 RALLY FOR HIMSELF AND THIS IS
 NOT WHAT THE 4th OF JULY IS
 SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT.
 THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
 CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF OUR
 NATION, THE BIRTH OF OUR
 DEMOCRACY AND REALLY HE'S
 TURNING IT INTO AN EVENT
 COMPLETELY FOR HIMSELF SOME
 WHERE HE COULD HIGHLIGHT HIMSELF
 AND WE'LL SEE SOME OF THESE
 HIGHLIGHTS AND CAMPAIGN FOOTAGE
 LATER ON.
 WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF
 CONGRESS IS PLANNING TO TAKE
 ACTION.
 WE SAW THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S
 REPORT WHICH IS SCAVING AND GOES
 RIGHT IN THE FACE OF WHAT DHS
 OFFICIALS AND LEADERS OF THE
 ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN SAYING
 ABOUT THESE DETENTION CENTERS.
 DHS REPORT IS RIGHT IN LINE OF
 WHAT OUR REPORTERS AND WHAT YOU
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE BEEN
 REPORTING ABOUT THESE CENTERS
 AND INCOMPLETE CONTRAST OF WHAT
 THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING.
 WELL, THE DHS REPORT IS
 CONFIRMING WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
 HEARING ALL ALONG THAT THE
 SITUATION DOWN THERE IN THE
 FACILITIES IS ATROCIOUS.
 YOU KNOW WE ARE TREATING THESE
 INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING HERE
 TO THE COUNTRY JUST TRYING TO
 SEEK A BETTER LIFE FOR
 THEMSELVES AND FAMILIES.
 WE ARE TREATING THEM WORSE THAN
 OUR PRISONERS.
 IT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO
 CHANGE.
 THAT'S WHY I COULD NOT SUPPORT
 THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT PASSED
 THROUGH THE HOUSE LAST WEEK THAT
 THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO SIGN.
 IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANY


 POLICIES.
 IT WILL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR
 HOMELAND SECURITY AND I.C.E.
 WE NEED REAL ACTION THAT'S GOING
 TO CHANGE THE CONDITIONS.
 $400 MILLION, THAT CAN'T BE
 BUSINESS AS USUAL.
 A LOT OF IT IS GOING TO GO.
 WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
 THEY'RE SAYING THERE IS NOTHING
 IN THAT BILL THAT'S GOING TO
 CHANGE WHAT WAS GOING ON.
 THERE IS NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO
 CHANGE THE STANDARDS.
 THERE IS NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO
 MAKE IT MANDATORY THAT THEY SEE
 A POSITION.
 WE ARE HEARING ABOUT THESE
 CHILDREN WHO ARE DYING BECAUSE
 NO ONE IS LOOKING AT THEM.
 THEY HAVE THE FLU OR THINGS THAT
 COULD BE TREATED SIMPLY THAT WE
 HAVE THE MEDICATION TO DO AND
 THEY ARE NOT GIVEN THAT
 MEDICATION.
 IT DOES NOT CHANGE POLICIES
 BUT IT DOES FUND -- I GUESS I
 WORRY OF WHAT YOU THINK OF A
 GOOD HUMANITARIAN BILL THAT'S
 NOT ACHIEVABLE AND VOTING
 AGAINST ONE THAT'S ACHIEVABLE.
 WELL, THIS IS A THING WE NEED
 TO KEEP TO PUSH FOR IT AND I AM
 GOING TO BE VOCAL ABOUT.
 WE NEED TO PUSH FOR HUMANITARIAN
 TREATMENTS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS
 THAT ARE IN THESE FACILITIES.
 WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'LL
 SEEK POSITIONS AND GET HOT MEALS
 AND IT IS NOT A SANDWICH.
 AGAIN, IT IS GOOD THAT THEY'LL
 BE ABLE TO GET MORE BALOGNEY

 SANDWICH.
 WE NEED A BILL THAT WILL CHANGE
 POLICIES AND MAKE SURE FAMILIES
 ARE GETTING HOT MEALS AND
 THEY'LL HAVE A TOOTHBRUSH AND BE
 ABLE TO SHOWER THERE.

 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN PROMISING TO LOWER DRUG
 PRESCRIPTION PRICES BUT IT
 APPEARS SOME ARE SPIKING.
 PRICE INCREASE BY 1.2% IN MAY
 COMPARES TO THE SAME MONTH LAST
 YEAR.
 NEW ANALYSIS BY RX SAING
 SOLUTIONS, IT IS A CONSULTANT
 SHOWS THAT THE PRICE OF MORE
 THAN 3400 DRUGS INCREASED ON AN
 AVERAGE OF 17% COMPARES TO THE
 SAME TIME LAST YEAR.
 WHAT ELSE IS UP 17%?
 THE AVERAGE PRICE HIKE IS 10.5%
 OR ABOUT FIVE TIMES THE RATE OF
 INFLATION OR YOUR PAYCHECK MAY
 HAVE GONE UP.
 AT LEAST 41 DRUGS INCREASED BY
 MORE THAN 100%.
 INCLUDES ONE VERSION OF
 FLUOXETINE, UP 879%.
 THIS IS A GENERIC.
 MOMETASONE, INCREASED BY 800%.
 AND COUGH MEDICINE WENT UP 300%.
 20 COMPANIES RAISED THE LIST
 PRICES OF MORE THAN 104
 PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AN AVERAGE OF

 ONE OF THEM IS A DRUG CALLED
 ISOLYTE, IT IS A SALINE SOLUTION
 USED TO HYDRATE PATIENTS IN
 HOSPITAL FOR YEARS, ESSENTIALLY
 SALT WATER.
 WITH ME NOW, DR. JOHN TORRES,
 EXPLAIN SOME OF THIS STUFF.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 I DWELL IN ECONOMICS AND YOU
 DWELL IN MEDICINES.
 I CAN NEVER FIGURE OUT HOW TO
 MAKE SENSE OF THE INCREASES.
 YOU ARE VERY WELL INFORMED.
 YOU TRY TO PAY FOR IT AND YOU
 FOUND OUT THE SAME DRUGS YOU
 USED A YEAR AGO IS DOUBLED IN
 PRICE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY.
 THE WORD THAT YOU HEAR A LOT IS
 TRANSPARENCY.
 THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT
 WE HAVE HERE IS THOSE DRUG
 PRICES ARE TRANSPARENT.
 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THOSE PRICES
 ARE SET AND HOW INSURANCE
 COMPANIES DECIDE TO CHARGE.
 WE HAVE THE MIDDLEMEN, THEY TAKE
 THEIR CUT AS WELL AND SO THERE
 IS A LOT OF HAND IN THAT PIE
 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET
 MONEY.
 THEY'RE NEGOTIATING WITH DUG
 MAKERS AND HEALTH PLANS AND
 INSURANCE COMPANIES AND
 PHARMACIES.
 THAT'S SORT OF THE BLACK BOX.
 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
 THERE.
 THE MAGIC GOES ON IN THERE.
 THE DRUG PRICE POPS OUT.
 THAT DRUG PRICE CAN CHANGE FROM
 MONTH TO MONTH.
 DIFFERENT FOR YOU AND ME AND
 SOMEONE PAYING CASH.
 WHETHER YOU HAVE INSURANCE OR
 NOT.
 WHAT IT IS AND YOU CAME AT THE
 SAME INSURANCE BUT HAVE
 DIFFERENT CONTRACTS AND GETTING
 CHARGED DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF
 MONEY.
 WE ARE ABLE TO AND CRITICAL
 OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS
 WORLD WHO SAYS PRESIDENT TRUMP
 HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS
 AND FELT IMPORTANT AND THAT HE'S
 FRUSTRATED.
 ALEX AZARE FOR NOT GETTING MORE
 DONE.
 WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING
 ONTO BRING THESE DRUG PRICES
 DOWN.
 CAN YOU HELP LOWER YOUR
 PRICES A LITTLE BIT?
 MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE SOME
 REGULATIONS WHERE THEY ARE NOT
 ABLE TO GET THAT PIECE OF THE
 PIE THEY WANT TO GET.
 THAT'S GOING TO LOWER PRICES AND
 PHARMACIES AND DON'T DISTRIBUTE
 IT FOR SUCH A BIG PRICE.
 THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT
 ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THIS.
 THEY HAVE A SYSTEM SET UP THAT'S
 ALL TRANSPARENT.
 EVERYBODY COMING AT THE BEGIN TO
 DECIDE ONE.
 AND TWO, WHAT'S THE PRICE WE ARE
 GOING TO SET ON DRUGS.
 AND IT IS JUST THE WAY THEIR
 SYSTEM IS SET UP.
 THAT'S ONLY BEEN FOR THE LAST
 DECADES OR SO.
 WE NEED SOMETHING IN THIS
 COUNTRY.
 THIS IS A GREAT DRUG SYSTEM FOR
 PEOPLE WHO MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT.
 IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING.
 I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK,
 JOHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
 BEING WITH US.
 SEND ME AN E-MAIL OR TWEET ME
 YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOU THINK
 COULD BE DONE ABOUT DRUG PRICES
 IN THIS COUNTRY.
 ANOTHER PIECE OF NEWS FOR
 YOU.
 VISIONARY LEE IACOCCA DIES ON
 TUESDAY.
 MANY OF YOU REMEMBER HIM AS
 ENTERING THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
 AS AN ENGINEER TRAINEE, THROUGH
 A SERIES OF SUCCESSES AND THE
 INVENTION OF THE MUSTANG,
 IACOCCA BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF
 FORD AT 46 YEARS OLD.
 BECAUSE OF TENSIONS BETWEEN
 HENRY FORD 2nd AND IACOCCA.
 HE SAVED THE COMPANY FROM
 BANKRUPTING BY INTRODUCING THE
 FUEL EFFICIENT CAR LINE AND
 ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO MAKE
 SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODELS OF CARS
 AT A TIME.
 HE INTRODUCED MINIVANS AND
 BRINGING CHRYSLER BACK INTO
 COMPETITION.
 HE MADE HIS NAME KNOWN BY
 APPEARING IN COMMERCIALS.
 HE WAS LISTED AS ONE OF THE
 WORLD'S MOST RESPECTED MEN.
 ONLY BEHIND RONALD REAGAN AND
 POPE JOHN PAUL THE SECOND.
 HE WAS 94 YEARS OLD.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
                      94 YEARS O. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
   Woman: (On phone) Discover.               Hi.
    Do you have a travel card?       Yep. Our Miles card.
     Earn unlimited 1.5 miles
    and we'll match it at the    end of your first year.
     Nice! I'm thinking about     a scuba diving trip.
              Woman:              Ooh!
            Or not.            You okay?
       Yeah, no, I'm good.
 <i> Earn miles. We'll match 'em</i> <i> at the end of your first year.</i>
 WELCOME BACK TO "VELSHI & RUHLE," THE REPORT DETAILS HOW
 TECH ADVOCACY GROUPS ARE PUSHING
 BACK AT LEGISLATION, AIMS AT
 REGULATING MAJOR TECH GIANTS
 WHICH WAS INTRODUCED BY JOSH
 HOLLY LAST MONTH.
 D.C. IS FEARING A QUOTE OF
 PARTISAN BLOOD MATH.
 ALAN SMITH IS JOINING US.
 WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
 WHAT'S THE LARGER CONCERN?
 SENATOR HOLLY, HE'S COMING IN
 AND WANTING TO BE THE
 REPUBLICAN.
 HE'S THE FOREFRONT OF SOME OF
 THESE TECH REGULATIONS BATTLE.
 HE WANTS TO HAVE A MUCH MORE
 ACTIVIST IN THIS REGARD.
 THIS BILL THAT HE PROPOSED IS
 VERY CONTROVERSIAL.
 THE BILL WOULD REMOVE SOME OF
 THE PROTECTIONS THAT MAJOR
 COMPANIES ENJOY.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT IT
 IS A LITTLE OUT OF DATE.
 A LITTLE BIT.
 THIS LAW PROVIDES FREEDOM FOR
 LIABILITY.
 THE BACK PAGE IS THE BEST
 EXAMPLE.
 WE ARE A SITE THAT PEOPLE PUT
 STUFF ON.
 YOU

 BACKPAGE ARGUES WE'RE JUST A
 SITE.
 YOU CAN'T HOLD US LIABLE FOR THE
 CONTENT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 WHAT HOLLEY CHOOSES TO DO, THE
 FTC WOULD VOTE IF THE COMPANY'S
 PRACTICES ARE, QUOTE,
 POLITICALLY NEWT PRACTICE.
 HOLLEY'S SIDE SAYS WITH A SUPER
 MAJORITY HAVING TO GET ON BOARD
 YOU WOULD HAVE A BIPARTISAN
 RESPONSE.
 THEY DON'T AGREE ON THE
 DEFINITION RIGHT NOW AND SOME OF
 THESE COMPANIES GET STUCK IN A
 PURGATORY WHERE THEY'RE NOT
 ACCEPTING IMMUNITY.
 THEY'LL END UP WITH MUCH WIDER
 SPREAD CENSORSHIP.
 THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REVIEW
 EVERY PIECE ON THE WEBSITE.
 THANK YOU.
 WE'RE SEEING RECORD CLOSINGS ON
 ALL THREE MAJOR INDICES.
 IN FACT, MARKETS CLOSED EARLY
 BECAUSE TOMORROW IS THE JULY 4th
 HOLIDAY.
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT THREE NEW
 RECORDS.
 THE DOW AT 29966.
 STANDARD & POOR'S, HALF A POINT
 SHORT.
 NASDAQ 8,170 POINTS.
 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NIKE'S
 CONTROVERSY.
 A FLAG ON A SHOE.
 WE'LL LOOK AT ALL SIDES OF THE
 DEBATE AND NOW NIKE HANDLED THE
 SITUATION.
 YOU'RE WATCHING "VELSHI & RUHLE"
 LIVE ON MSNBC.

 Going to the Shawn Mendes Verizon UP concert
 was like an out of body experience.
   We were right in front of him. Dead center. Front row.
 'Cause actually, Zarmina, you touched Shawn Mendes.
             Yeah, I touched him! She touched Shawn Mendes!
             He like held my hand             for a while.
               And then we got               to meet him after,               which was like...
 Another surprise.                            Yeah.
   We love Verizon even more now.
                I'll never forget                that day. Ever.
 The network more people rely on,         gives you more.
    Like thousands of tickets           to concerts,
   festivals and private shows.
        And big savings on our best phones when you switch.
 TODAY, NIKE AND COLIN KAEPERNICK ARE BACK IN THE
 CENTER OF CONTROVERSY AND THIS
 TIME IT'S OVER SNEAKERS.
 NIKE IS PULLING THESE SHOES FROM
 THE SO-CALLED BETSY ROSS VERSION
 OF THE AMERICAN FLAG.
 TO SOME PEOPLE THAT IS A FLAG
 REPRESENTING HATE AND SLAVERY
 BECAUSE IT WAS IN PLACE AT THE
 TIME WHEN SLAVERY WAS ENSHRINED
 IN THE UNITED STATES.
 TO OTHERS, IT'S A PATRIOT SYMBOL
 OF THE WAR.
 STEPHANIE GOSK HAS MORE.
 Reporter: NIKE'S RED, WHITE
 AND BLUE WITH THE FLAG IS
 WHIPPING UP EVEN MORE
 CONTROVERSY, THREATENING TO PULL
 THE MANUFACTURING PLANT IN HIS
 STATE, ADDING WORDS CAN NOT
 EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINT AT THIS
 TERRIBLE DECISION.
 THE FUTURE OF THE FACILITY WHICH
 WOULD EMPLOY ABOUT 500 PEOPLE IS
 UNCLEAR.
 ACCORDING TO "THE WALL STREET
 JOURNAL," FORMER NFL QUARTERBACK
 COLIN KAEPERNICK SPEARHEADED THE
 CALL TO GET NIKE TO PULL THE
 SHOE.
 CITING PEOPLE NAM WITH THE
 MATTER, THE REPORT SAYS HE WAS
 OFFENDED BY THE USE OF THE FLAG,
 AS WERE OTHERS.
 IN A STATEMENT, NIKE SAYS ITS
 DECISION TO RECALL THE DESIGN
 WAS BASED ON CONCERNS THAT IT
 COULD UNINTENTIONALLY OFFEND AND
 DETRACT FROM THE NATION'S
 PATRIOTIC HOLIDAY.
 WHEN THE ICONIC BRAND REVEALED
 THE SHOE LATE LAST MONTH,
 CRITICS SPOKE OUT.
 ONE WRITING, NIKE, YOU SHOULD BE
 ASHAMED OF THIS SHOE.
 ANOTHER WROTE, CAN'T WAIT FOR
 THE CONFEDERATE AIR MAX 90s.
 THE SO-CALLED BETSY ROSS FLAG
 NAMED AFTER THE 18th CENTURY
 WOMAN KNOWN FOR DESIGNING IT.
 SOME SAY IT CELEBRATES THE TIME
 OF SLAVERY.
 WHILE OTHERS INCLUDING TEXAS
 SENATOR TED CRUZ ARE RENEWING
 CALLING FOR A NIKE BOYCOTT.
 CRUZ TWEETING IN PART THEIR
 SHOES REPRESENT INSIDE DISDAIN
 FOR THE AMERICAN FLAG.
 SIMILAR CALLS WERE MADE WHEN
 NIKE PARTNERED WITH KAEPERNICK
 LAST YEAR IN AN AD CAMPAIGN.
 BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.
 EVEN IF IT MEANS SACRIFICING
 EVERYTHING.
 Reporter: THE FORMER
 QUARTERBACK WAS THE FIRST IN THE
 NFL TO KNEEL DURING THE NATIONAL
 ANTHEM, PROTESTING POLICE
 BRUTALITY AND RACIAL INJUSTICE.
 SOME BURNED THEIR SHOES AND
 BOYCOTTED NIKE, WHILE THE
 COMPANY SAW ITS SALES RISE AND
 ITS STOCK PRICE SURGE.
 JOINING ME NOW IS NBC'S
 STEPHANIE GOSK.
 THIS WILL BE A CASE STUDY?
 YES, AT THE MOMENT WHEN AT
 THE CENTER OF A SNEAKERS WAR.
 EVERYBODY HAS DUG INTO THIS
 ONE.
 YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT IT'S
 A CONVERSATION WE KNEAD TO HAVE.
 THERE ARE CLEARLY PEOPLE ON BOTH
 SIDES WHO ARE AGITATED AND UPSET
 FOR QUITE HONESTLY
 UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS.
 WHERE DO WE COME TOGETHER AS A
 COUNTRY TO TALK ABOUT IT IS
 REALLY THE CRUCIAL QUESTION.
 I WAS SURPRISED IN YOUR PIECE
 AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE STORY
 TO FIND THAT PEOPLE FOSHT THIS
 SO-CALLED BETSY ROSS FLAG.
 THEY MAY HAVE JUST CHANGED THE
 STAR DESIGN WITH THE SAME
 FEELINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOR
 THE CONFEDERATE FLAG.
 RIGHT.
 THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITED
 EXAMPLES, FRINGES, THERE WAS A
 CHAPTER OF THE KU KLUX KLAN THAT
 HAD FLYERS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK
 THAT USED THE FLAG TO RECRUIT
 PEOPLE TO THEIR CHAPTER.
 THAT'S OBVIOUSLY PRETTY LIMITED.
 THERE WERE A COUPLE OF HIGH
 SCHOOL STUDENTS AT A HIGH SCHOOL
 FOOTBALL GAME A COUPLE YEARS AGO
 THAT WERE WAVING THE FLAG AND
 LATER THE SUPERINTENDENT CAME
 OUT AND APOLOGIZED FOR THAT.
 SAYING THAT THE FLAG HAD BECOME
 WHAT HE CALLED A SYMBOL OF HATE
 BUT THOSE ARE LIMITED EXAMPLES.
 AND THIS CONTROVERSY, CLEARLY
 THE MOST WIDESPREAD THAT WE'VE
 SEEN WHEN IT COMES TO THIS FLAG.
 THIS HASN'T REALLY HURT
 NIKE'S STOCK PRICES.
 NIKE HAS BEEN THROUGH
 CONTROVERSIES.
 BUT NIKE UNDERSTANDS BRANDING
 POSSIBLY MORE THAN MOST OTHER
 COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.
 IS IT INTERESTING TO YOU THAT
 THIS GOT TO THIS POINT WITHOUT
 NIKE HAVING FIGURED OUT THERE
 MIGHT BE SOME CONTROVERSY AROUND
 THIS?
 IT IS.
 I ALSO THINK IT'S A STATEMENT ON
 JUST HOW CONTROVERSIAL THIS FLAG
 REALLY IS.
 BECAUSE, LIKE YOU SAY, BRANDING
 FOR NIKE IS SECOND NATURE.
 THEY HAVE ALMOST DEFINED THE
 BRAND FOR US.
 YEAH.
 WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT SWOOSH
 WAS.
 WITH THE MARKETING, YEAH.
 AND SIGNING KAEPERNICK, YOU
 KNOW, IN THOSE MOMENTS IN WHICH
 THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM
 WHICH WILL THEY KNEW THEYE
