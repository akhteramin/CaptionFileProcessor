 ANNOUNCER: MICROWAVE BREAKFASTS. DR. OZ: BURRITOS AND EGG
 MUFFINS.
 ANNOUNCER: FAST AND EASY.
 BREAKFAST FOODS ARE PLAYING.
 ANNOUNCER: BUT ARE THEY REALLY
 GOOD FOR YOU?
 DR. OZ: ARE THEY JUST JUNK FOOD
 IN DISGUISE?
 ANNOUNCER: PLUS, FAT SEAMERS
 CAUGHT ON TAPE.
 SHE IS EATING TOO MUCH
 CHOCOLATE.
 WHY ARE YOU INSULTING ME
 ABOUT MY WEIGHT?
 ANNOUNCER: COMING UP NEXT.

 DR. OZ: ARE Y'ALL READY FOR
 SEASON 10?
 YEAH!

 I LOVE YOU, DR. OZ.
 [APPLAUSE]


 DR. OZ: TODAY, AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FROZEN FOOD I'LL.
 THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS OFFERING AN
 UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF
 MICROWAVEABLE BREAKFAST FOOD
 OPTIONS INCLUDING BURRITOS AND
 EGG MUFFINS READY IN MINUTES.
 MANY CLAIM TO BE HEALTHIER.
 BUT ARE THEY?
 OR ARE THEY JUST JUNK FOOD IN
 DISGUISE?
 SHE PUT MANY OPTIONS TO THE TEST
 IN THE BEST FOOD LAB THERE IS,
 HER OWN BUSY KITCHEN.
 I AM SHOPPING FOR BREAKFAST
 SANDWICHES.
 I CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
 I BOUGHT A BREAKFAST SANDWICH.
 THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.
 DO YOU WANT TO TRY THESE FOR
 BREAKFAST?
 WHAT IS IT?
 IT IS A BREAKFAST SANDWICH
 MADE ON A WAFFLE.
 BACON EGG AND CHEESE.
 I DON'T LIKE EGGS OR CHEESE
 BUT I COULD TRY IT WITH
 SOMETHING ELSE.
 THIS IS WHAT I ENDED UP
 GETTING.
 TWO DIFFERENT ENGLISH MUFFINS.
 THEY ARE DIFFERENT.
 THIS IS ON A WAFFLE.
 AND THIS IS A BREATHLESS E --
 BREADLESS EGG CUP I AM EXCITED
 ABOUT.
 DR. OZ: WAS THAT THE BEST
 ASSIGNMENT YOU HAVE EVER BEEN
 GIVEN?
 ANY ASSIGNMENT WITH FOOD,
 SIGN ME UP.
 BREAKFAST IS NOT A HARD MEAL FOR
 ME.
 I WAS HAPPY TO GET THIS
 ASSIGNMENT BECAUSE IT IS TOUGH
 FOR ME.
 I AM A LOW-CARB EATER.
 FOR MY KIDS, I AM LOOKING FOR
 ALTERNATIVES TO THE STAPLES THAT
 ARE HIGH SUGAR AND HIGH CARB.
 THIS COULD CHANGE THINGS AT MY
 HOUSE.
 DR. OZ: HOW BIG HAVE THESE
 BECOME?
 WHEN IT COMES TO FROZEN FOOD,
 BREAKFAST FOODS ARE DOING SO
 WELL.
 IT IS FOR TWO REASONS.
 ONE IS MILLENNIALS.
 82% OF MILLENNIALS SAY THIS IS A
 GOOD OPTION FOR THEIR KIDS.
 I AGREE WITH THAT COMPLETELY.
 THE OTHER ONE IS THE KETO CROWD.
 THEY ARE LOOKING FOR LOW-CARB
 OPTIONS.
 THOSE TWO THINGS ARE DRIVING THE
 INDUSTRY.
 DR. OZ: THE BUN IS EGG.
 WE ASKED FOOD SCIENTIST TAYLOR
 WALLACE TO BREAK DOWN HOW
 MICROWAVABLE BREAKFASTS ARE
 MADE.
 IS THERE REAL EGG IN THESE?
 ACTUALLY, YES.
 IN MANY OF THE PRODUCTS, THE
 MAIN INGREDIENT IS A WHOLE EGG.
 YOU WILL SEE SOME OF YOUR NORMAL
 CULPRITS, DIFFERENT FOOD
 ADDITIVES.
 THEY MIGHT LOOK SCARY, BUT THEY
 ARE IN THERE FOR A FUNCTIONAL
 PURPOSE.
 SAM TIM GUNN  ZANTHAM GUM IS
 WHAT WE ADD SO THE EGG DOES NOT
 CRUMBLE.
 MODIFIED FOOD STARCH PROVIDES
 TEXTURE.
 YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT
 FLAVORS.
 YOU MIGHT ASK, WHY NOT JUST ADD
 BUTTER?
 IT OXIDIZES AND MAKES THE
 PRODUCT GO STALE.
 INSTEAD, THESE PRODUCE THE
 TASTE.
 DR. OZ: I LOVE THAT IT IS REAL
 EGG.
 YOU HAVE A WAY OF MAKING THE
 FROZEN MICROWAVABLE BREAKFASTS
 WITH FLAVOR.
 IT HAS TO DO WITH THIS.
 YOU ARE A FLAVOR SCIENTIST.
 WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH
 FLAVOR?
 THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU HAVE
 TO WORRY ABOUT IN PRODUCTS LIKE
 EGG SANDWICHES.
 ONE IS WATER BECAUSE WE KNOW
 THAT WATER MAKES THINGS GO BAD.
 NUMBER TWO IS OXYGEN BECAUSE
 OXYGEN OXIDIZES THINGS.
 FROZEN WATER CANNOT DO MUCH.
 THEN WE ADD NITROGEN TO THE
 PACKAGE, SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SEE
 IN POTATO CHIPS WITH THE AIR
 INSIDE.
 THAT IS NITROGEN.
 WHEN YOU OPEN THE BAG, THE
 OXYGEN COMES IN.
 YOU LEAVE IT OUT FOR A DAY AND
 IT GOES STALE.
 THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH EGG
 SANDWICHES.
 DR. OZ: I TOOK THE LIST YOU HAVE
 AN SPLIT IT UP.
 EXPLAIN HOW PEOPLE HAVE HACKED
 THE SYSTEM.
 AS A REMINDER, IT IS VERY
 HIGH-FAT, LOW-CARB.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT TRADITIONAL
 BREAKFAST SANDWICHES, THESE ARE
 NOT ANAN OPTION FOR KETO FOLLOWS
 BECAUSE OF THE BREAD.
 THIS IS A GAME CHANGER IF YOU
 ARE A KETO DEVOTEE.
 THEY HAVE MADE THE BREAD OUT OF
 EGGS.
 THIS IS BREADLESS.
 DR. OZ: I WAS NOT SURE IT WAS
 REAL.
 IT IS REAL.
 IT IS EGGS.
 IT IS HIGH-PROTEIN.
 EXTREMELY LOW CAR.
 THIS IS THE INDUSTRY RESPONDING
 TO THE DEMAND.
 DR. OZ: SEVEN GRAMS OF CARBS.
 HOW DOES THE REST OF IT COMPARE?
 ENGLISH MUFFIN OPTION, 28
 GRAMS OF CARBS.
 HERE WE HAVE THE CROISSANT, 27
 GRAMS.
 THE BISCUIT LOOKS THE MOST
 DELICIOUS.
 I'M WORKING HARD NOT TO TAKE A
 BITE.
 DR. OZ: FLATBREAD IS A GOOD
 IDEA.
 IT IS A GREAT IDEA.
 IT IS STILL HIGHER.
 DR. OZ: HOW DID THE BREAD LESS
 VERSION DO?
 IT WAS DELICIOUS.
 I DID NOT MISS THE BREAD BUT I
 HAD TO WONDER IF IT WAS TOO MUCH
 PROTEIN.
 DR. OZ: I THINK PROTEIN IS OK.
 THE BIGGER ISSUE FOR ME IS SALT.
 RE-FREEZE THINGS, -WHEN YOU
 FREEZE THINGS, HE CAN HAVE MORE
 SALT THAN YOU WANT.
 I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE
 OPTIONS.
 THE NEXT INVESTIGATION HAS TO DO
 WITH THE CRUSTLESS QUICHES.
 THERE ARE NO CARBS?
 DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT?
 COMPARE THESE AND SEE IF YOU
 TASTE A DIFFERENCE.
 I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER
 ASK.
 DR. OZ: I'M GOING TO REVEAL
 SOMETHING TO YOU IN A SECOND.
 THESE ARE NOT MADE THE SAME WAY.
 WHICH DO YOU LIKE MORE?
 MUCH BETTER?
 ONE OF THESE IS HOMEMADE BY
 YOURS TRULY.
 THE OTHER WAS MADE IN A STORE.
 THIS WAS MADE BY US.
 NICE JOB, DR. OZ.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THIS IS THE STORE-BOUGHT
 ONE.
 I POINTED OUT BECAUSE IT TAKES A
 TON OF TIME.
 I THINK MOST PEOPLE PREFER IT
 BUT I GET WHAT YOU DON'T DO IT
 BECAUSE OF LACK OF TIME.
 DOES THIS TASTE GOOD ENOUGH THAT
 YOU WOULD BE OK WITH IT?
 IT WORKS?
 GREAT OPTION.
 DR. OZ: I DON'T THINK IT IS
 QUITE THE SAME AS MAKING IT
 YOURSELF BUT GOOD ENOUGH FOR
 MOST BUSY MOMS.
 HOW DO THEY COMPARE
 NUTRITIONALLY?
 THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD NEWS.
 THE STORE-BOUGHT ONES ARE REAL
 EGG OR EGG-BASED.
 THEY DO HAVE OTHER THINGS ADDED
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO LIVE ON A
 SHELF AND BE FROZEN.
 FOR THE MOST PART, IT IS CLOSE
 TO THE REAL THING.
 YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT EATING
 THEM AND GIVING THEM TO YOUR
 KIDS.
 DR. OZ: WE INVESTIGATED FROZEN
 MICROWAVE BREAKFAST BURRITOS.
 THEY SEEM TO BE MAKING A
 COMEBACK.
 WHEN I WAS A KID, IT WAS LIKE
 THESE THINGS ARE TERRIBLE.
 THEY ARE MUSHY AND GOOEY.
 FOOD SCIENTISTS HAVE IT DOWN TO
 AN ART.
 NOW THEY TASTE FANTASTIC.
 THERE ARE VEGETARIAN OPTIONS.
 THERE ARE FARM TO TABLE OPTIONS.
 THEY HAVE SOMETHING FOR
 EVERYBODY.
 DR. OZ: WE SAY MAKE BACON A
 SPECIAL FOOD.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, WE SHOW YOU A
 NEW MICROWAVABLE BREAKFAST THAT
 ALLOWS YOU TO USE YOUR OWN FRESH
 EGG.
 IS IT THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS?

  <i> You're going to do your thing.</i>
 <i>And no period is gonna slow you</i> <i>down!</i>
 <i>With Tampax, you get protection</i> <i>that moves with you</i>
        <i> for total comfort.</i>
   <i> Choose Pearl for your chill,</i>
      <i> pocket for your moves,</i>
   <i> and Active for your hustle.</i>
    <i> Do your thing with Tampax.</i>
 BABYBEL: I used be a one-cheese            operation,
  but me and Crunchy here make a           great team.
  We even finish each other's...
   BABYBEL: (To Crunchy)You're   supposed to say sentences...
      CRUNCHY: ---sentences.
      BABYBEL: Well not now.
   Delicious new Babybel Cheese          and Crackers.
        BABYBEL: Saved it!
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: IF YOU HAVE EVER TRIED
 TO MAKE AN OMELETTE AND THIS
 HAPPENED, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
 RESTAURANTS USE MAKING AN
 OMELETTE IS THE ULTIMATE TEST OF
 A CHEF'S TRUE SKILLS.
 TODAY, WE ARE INVESTIGATING A
 NEW SHORTCUT TURNING ON LET'S --
 OMELETS INTO A WEEKDAY MEAL.
 OMELETS IN A CUP.
 THERE ARE TWO MAIN KINDS.
 MAKE THEM UP FOR US.
 GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE
 PACKAGE.
 IT HAS EVERYTHING INSIDE.
 YOU HAVE VEGETABLES AND MEAT.
 THEN YOU HAVE LIQUID EGG.
 IT IS BASICALLY THE SAME THING
 YOU BUY IN THE GROCERY STORE IN
 THE DRUGS.
 IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN
 REAL EGG TO PREVENT BACTERIA
 FROM GROWING.
 YOU CAN POP IT IN THE MICROWAVE
 AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO.
 DR. OZ: SO SIMPLE.
 HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?
 THIS IS FOR CONSUMERS WHO
 PREFER THEIR PRODUCTS LESS
 PROCESSED.
 WE CHARGE THE SAME PRICE BUT DO
 NOT ADD THE EGG.
 YOU HAVE TO ADD YOUR OWN.
 DR. OZ: YOU'RE KIDDING.
 IT IS THE SAME PRICE?
 YOU HAVE TO ADD YOUR OWN
 EGG.
 YOU HAVE THE CHEESE, VEGETABLES,
 MEAT, SAME AS THE OTHER PRODUCT.
 DR. OZ: BREAK THE EGG.
 MY GOODNESS.
 BREAK IT OVER HERE AND PUT IT IN
 THE PAN.
 THAT IS IT.
 YOU ADD THE GOODIES.
 MIX IT UP AND THERE YOU GO.
 DR. OZ: I AM IMPRESSED.
 THIS IS SO CLOSE TO WHAT I
 NORMALLY DO BUT I WOULD THINK
 ABOUT THIS.
 THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE
 NORMAL FOOD PRODUCTS YOU WOULD
 COOK IN YOUR KITCHEN.
 I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIVES
 TO PREVENT MOLD OR BACTERIAL
 GROWTH.
 BUT OVERALL, IT IS THE SAME
 THING.
 DR. OZ: THE FOOD SCIENTIST IS
 HAPPY, I'M HAPPY.
 THE PRICE IS THE SAME.
 ABOUT $3 A PACKAGE.
 GREAT FOR A COLLEGE STUDENT OR
 SOMEONE ON THE GO.
 CAN YOU GET ADDICTED TO
 MICROWAVE MEALS?

    So Kim, you going for our big     Drive Safe & Save discount?
 Yup, using the app. I've been        quite vigilant.
    Sharon says step on it. The        meeting's started.

 MICROWAVE FOODS COULD BE DOING TO YOUR BRAIN.

 [BEEPING]
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I KNOW.
 DID YOU START TO SALIVATE AT THE
 SOUND OF THE MICROWAVE?
 MILLIONS RELY ON QUICK MICROWAVE
 MEALS FOR A QUICK LUNCH OR HOT
 DINNER.
 THE CAN YOU GET ADDICTED TO
 THESE -BUT CAN YOU GET
 ADDICTED TO THESE FAST FOOD
 FROZEN FOODS?
 DOES YOUR FREEZER LOOK LIKE
 THIS?
 SOMEONE IN OUR AUDIENCE IS THE
 OWNER OF THIS STOCK FREEZER FULL
 OF MICROWAVE MEALS AND IT HAS
 TURNED INTO AN OBSESSION WITH
 MICROWAVE MEALS.
 PLEASE WELCOME ANGELA WHO WAS
 TURNED IN BY HER BEST FRIEND
 BELLA.
 I THINK I AM FINE.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
 SHE HAS A VERY BIG PROBLEM.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS A REAL PHOTO OF
 HER FREEZER?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: HOW OFTEN DOES SHE
 MICROWAVE FROZEN FOOD?
 ALL THE TIME.
 BREAKFAST, LUNCH, SNACKS.
 I LOVE IT.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT
 IT?
 THEY HAVE HEALTHY ONES.
 LEAN CUISINE, HOT POCKETS IN A
 RUSH.
 EASY AS CAN BE.
 DR. OZ: WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
 YOUR FRIEND'S CONCERN OVER YOUR
 PERCEIVED ADDICTION FOR
 MICROWAVE FAST FOOD?
 I DON'T KNOW HER CONCERN.
 YOU DON'T KNOW MY CONCERN?
 YOU SEND ME COUPONS.
 YOU WANT TO BUY THINGS OFF EBAY.
 YOU GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE.
 NO.
 IT IS TOO MUCH.
 DR. OZ: COME UP HERE.
 I UNDERSTAND THE ALLURE OF
 FROZEN MEALS.
 BUT IN REALITY, THERE IS
 SOMETHING REALLY ADDICTIVE IN
 THESE FOODS THAT MAKES THEM SO
 DESIROUS FOR US.
 MARK HAS MADE A TASTE TEST YOU
 AND I WILL BE PARTICIPANTS IN.
 TELL US WHAT WE WILL TASTE.
 WE HAVE THREE LASAGNAS.
 THE FIRST IS FRESH LIKE YOU MAKE
 AT HOME.
 THIS IS ALSO LASAGNA WE MADE BUT
 NOT FRESH.
 WE FROZE IT AND REHEATED IT.
 DR. OZ: FRESH IS GOOD.
 KEEP GOING.
 I AM MOVING ALONG.
 THEN WE HAVE THE
 MICROWAVEABLE LASAGNA LIKE YOU
 BUY AT THE SUPERMARKET.
 SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE.
 DR. OZ: LET ME TRY IT.
 THAT IS GOOD.
 THAT IS REALLY GOOD.
 TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT
 IT.
 DR. OZ: SEE IF YOU LIKE IT.
 TASTES GOOD.
 DR. OZ: THIS IS ACTUALLY BETTER
 THAN THE FRESH.
 SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING
 HAPPENING HERE.
 THIS IS ANOTHER TALE OF TASTE
 BUDS TRICKERY.
 IT IS IN THE FLAVOR.
 IT IS AND HOW THEY CREATED THE
 EXPERIENCE OF LASAGNA IN A
 FROZEN FOOD WHERE WE WILL FIND
 SOMETHING INTERESTING.
 DR. OZ: AND COVER THE ANATOMY OF
 A MICROWAVE -UNCOVERED THE
 ANATOMY OF THE MICROWAVE MEAL.
 WHAT DO THEY DO DIFFERENTLY?
 THE FIRST ISSUE IS
 PRESERVATIVES.
 WHAT KIND ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
 TO GET THE FLAVOR, THEY USE
 SYNTHETIC FLAVORINGS.
 THAT IS HOW THEY JACK UP THE
 FLAVOR.
 WE SEE A LOT OF THE SAME GUILTY
 SUSPECTS WE SEE IN OTHER
 PROCESSED FOODS.
 POLYSORBATE 80 IS A BOOKING
 AGENT.
 IT MAKES THE SAUCE TASTE NICE
 AND SMOOTH.
 POTASSIUM BROMINE IS ILLEGAL IN
 SOME COUNTRIES.
 DR. OZ: IT IS ILLEGAL IN SOME
 COUNTRIES?
 ILLEGAL AND IT IS IN OUR
 FROZEN FOODS.
 DR. OZ: THESE ARE THEORETICAL
 CONCERNS.
 THE NEXT IS A REAL CONCERN,
 SUGAR.
 WHY WOULD YOU ADD SUGAR TO
 LASAGNA?
 AS WE SAW, THE FLAVOR TAKES A
 BEATING.
 WHAT IS AN EASY WAY TO JACK UP
 THE FLAVOR?
 JUST DUMP IN SOME SUGAR.
 YOU WILL BE SHOCKED HOW MUCH.
 WE FOUND ONE FROZEN ENTRÉE THAT
 HAD 29 GRAMS OF SUGAR IN A
 SERVING.
 IT GETS WORSE.
 GUESS HOW BIG THE SERVING IS?
 THIS BIG.
 IT IS ONLY HALF.
 MOST PEOPLE THINK I GET TO EAT
 THE WHOLE THING.
 THEN YOU ARE GETTING 58 GRAMS OF
 SUGAR.
 THAT IS THE SUGAR IN TWO CANDY
 BARS.
 WHO WOULD EVER THINK THERE IS
 TWO CANDY BARS WORTH OF SUGAR?
 IT IS CRAZY.
 DR. OZ: A LOT OF SUGAR.
 A HIDDEN SOURCE OF CARBS,
 MODIFIED STARCH.
 IT IS THERE TO GET RID OF
 SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU GET
 WHEN YOU REHEAT FROZEN FOODS.
 YOU DO NOT GET THE PUDDLES OF
 WATER.
 IT HOLDS ITS SHAPE.
 IT IS CARBOHYDRATES THAT HAVE NO
 FLAVOR.
 YOU'RE GETTING CARBS IN YOUR
 TUMMY DO NOT TASTE.
 THAT IS THE WORRY.
 DR. OZ: EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS TO
 YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU ARE HAVING
 THESE EMPTY CARBS HIDDEN.
 TAKE A BITE OUT OF ONE OF THESE
 MEALS.
 YOU BEGIN TO FALL IN LOVE WITH
 THIS.
 YOU BEGIN TO CRAVE IT.
 YOUR BLOOD SUGAR STARTS TO
 SPIKE.
 WHEN THE BLOOD SUGAR GOES UP,
 DOPAMINE IS RELEASED THAT MAKES
 YOU REALLY HAPPY AND SMILING.
 WE KNOW THAT FROM COMFORT FOOD.
 THEN YOUR BLOOD SUGAR FALLS
 AGAIN AND YOU CRAVE THAT HIGH
 YOU JUST HAVE.
 YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS CAUSE
 INCREASED APPETITE.
 YOU EAT MORE FOOD.
 THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
 EATING MORE OF THE FROZEN FOODS
 YOUR CRAVING AND FEELING GOOD
 ABOUT DOING IT --OK ABOUT DOING
 IT.
 LIKE CHEMICAL ADDICTION, THERE
 IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL ADDICTION
 THESE MICROWAVE MEALS CAN CAUSE.
 WE HAVE SEEN THIS INTERACTION
 BEFORE WITH FOODS WITH A LOT OF
 SUGAR AND FLAVOR.
 HARD TO STOP EATING.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THESE
 GET US EATING TOO MUCH.
 DR. OZ: DON'T BE A KILLJOY.
 SHE IS NERVOUSLY LAUGHING.
 SHE WILL PROBABLY STILL EAT SOME
 OF THE MEALS IN HER FREEZER.
 GIVE US SOME TACTICS AND HACKS.
 LOOK AT THE INGREDIENT LIST
 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALL THE
 SAME.
 INGREDIENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF
 THE LIST, THERE ARE MORE OF
 THEM.
 LOOK AT THE GOOD THINGS AT THE
 BEGINNING.
 IF THERE IS SOME AT THE END,
 THERE IS NOT MUCH.
 DR. OZ: THEY SEEM TO THINK YOU
 ARE BETTER SERVED TO EAT
 MICROWAVE MEALS DIFFERENTLY.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 I THINK I WON'T DO IT EVERY
 DAY.
 MAYBE TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: ACTUALLY HAVING AN
 IMPACT.
 NICELY DONE.
 THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.[APPLAUSE]

 DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH OUR INVESTIGATION INTO PUBLIC FAT
 SHAMING.
 WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IF IT
 HAPPENED TO YOU?
 WHAT IF IT CAME FROM THE ONE
 PERSON YOU TRUST THE MOST, YOUR
 DOCTOR.
 ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY, ABOUT
 HALF OF WOMEN SAID TO HAVE BEEN
 SHAMED BY A PHYSICIAN.
 SHE SAYS SHE WAS FAT SHAMED BY
 HER DOCTOR WHO IGNORED HER PAIN
 SYMPTOMS.
 AFTER FEELING ILL, REBECCA SAYS
 HER DOCTOR TOLD HER TO LOSE
 WEIGHT.
 IT TURNS OUT HER HEALTH ISSUES
 WERE NOT A RESULT OF HER SIZE.
 EXACTLY CANCER.
 --IT WAS ACTUALLY CANCER.
 YOUR CASE IS SERIOUS.
 YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR.
 YOU ARE NOT FEELING WELL.
 HOW DID THEY RESPOND TO THE
 OBSERVATIONS YOU WERE MAKING
 ABOUT YOUR OWN BODY?
 VERY MUCH A DISMISSAL.
 IT WAS A DISMISSAL OF SYMPTOMS
 OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
 IF YOU JUST LOST A LITTLE
 WEIGHT, YOU WOULD BE FINE.
 IF YOU LOST A LITTLE WEIGHT, YOU
 COULD BRIEF BETTER.
 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON,
 BUT IF YOU LOST WEIGHT,
 EVERYTHING WOULD BE OK.
 DR. OZ: AFTER THREE YEARS OF
 LOOKING AROUND, YOU FINALLY GOT
 A DIAGNOSIS.
 WHAT WAS HAPPENING INSIDE YOUR
 BODY?
 I HAD A TUMOR IN MY LUNG.
 AND IT HAD KIND OF KILLED THE
 BOTTOM HALF OF MY LUNG AND THEY
 HAD TO TAKE THE WHOLE LEFT LUNG
 OUT.
 DR. OZ: IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO
 FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.
 WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU
 FINALLY REALIZED YOU HAD A
 LIFE-THREATENING PROBLEM CAUSING
 THIS AND IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE
 WITH YOUR WEIGHT WHICH YOU NEVER
 THOUGHT WAS A PROBLEM TO BEGIN
 WITH?
 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I
 FINALLY GOT A DIAGNOSIS.
 I SPENT SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO
 FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH
 ME.
 SOMEONE FINALLY TOLD ME
 SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
 IT WAS FREEING TO REALIZE THERE
 WAS SOMETHING THERE AND NOT JUST
 SOMETHING WRONG IN THIS BODY.
 DR. OZ: I WISH YOU WERE THE ONLY
 PERSON WHO FELT THE WAY YOU
 FELT.
 IT TURNS OUT OBESE PATIENTS ARE
 65% MORE LIKELY THAN OTHERS TO
 HAVE UNDIAGNOSED MEDICAL
 CONDITIONS.
 WE WRITE IT OFF, SAY SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 SOMETIMES IT IS THE WEIGHT THAT
 IS A PROBLEM.
 OTHER TIMES, IT IS NOT.
 ARE YOU FEELING OK NOW?
 I HAVE BEEN CANCER FREE SINCE

 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: GOOD FOR YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR
 STORY.
 ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF DOCTORS
 OVERLOOKING A REAL DIAGNOSIS.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
 I HAD BEEN IN PAIN FOR THE
 PAST TWO DECADES SINCE I STARTED
 ADMINISTRATION -MENSTRUATION
 SINCE I WAS 10 OR 11.
 I WOULD FEEL THIS PARALYZING
 PAIN EVERY TIME MY MENSES
 WOULD COME ABOUT.
 THEY SAID HOW ABOUT WE GIVE YOU
 BIRTH CONTROL.
 I STARTED GAINING WEIGHT AFTER I
 HAD MY SON.
 IT WAS AUTOMATICALLY SHIFTED TO
 IT HAS TO BE AWAKE.
 -YOUR WEIGHT.
 DR. OZ: YOUR DOCTORS FOUND THE
 REAL DIAGNOSIS.
 WHAT WAS GOING ON?
 I WOULD DIAGNOSES WITH
 ENDOMETRIOSIS.
 IT WAS NOT FOUND UNTIL I MISSED
 MY PERIOD FOUR TIMES.
 IT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE BRUSH OFF
 AS NOTHING.
 I FIND THAT IS AN ISSUE WITH A
 LOT OF THINGS IN REPRODUCTIVE
 HEALTH.
 DR. OZ: THE REASON I AM
 PASSIONATE ABOUT THE TOPIC OF
 FAT SHAMING IS IT CAN EMBARRASS
 PEOPLE.
 WE ALSO MISS THE REAL DIAGNOSIS
 WHICH IS THE MORE OBVIOUS WAY WE
 HURT PEOPLE.
 SHE IS ABOUT TO RUN HER 17TH
 MARATHON.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: NEITHER OF YOU GOT HELD
 BACK.
 WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO DOCTORS
 WHO ARE TOO EASILY WRITING OFF
 SYMPTOMS FOR THE PATIENTS BEING
 OVERWEIGHT?
 LISTEN TO YOUR PATIENTS.
 BE PATIENT WITH YOUR PATIENTS.
 DON'T JUST BRUSH IT OFF.
 TRY TO GIVE THEM A DIAGNOSIS.
 DO THE WORK.
 LOOK INTO IT.
 DO BLOOD TESTS.
 THEY PROVED I DID NOT HAVE
 THINGS THEY THOUGHT I HAD.
 LISTENED TO US.
 WHEN YOU DON'T LISTEN TO US, WE
 HAVE MISTRUST AND WORRY AND REAL
 FEAR THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO
 TAKE US SERIOUS.
 IT MAKES PEOPLE NOT WANT TO COME
 TO YOU.
 WE GO TO YOU TO TRUST YOU, SO
 JUST LISTEN TO US AND KNOW THAT
 THIS IS NOT ALL IN OUR HEADS.
 WE KNOW OUR BODIES MORE THAN
 ANYBODY ELSE.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU FOR SHARING
 YOUR STORIES WITH US.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: NEXT, FAT SHAMING CAUGHT
 ON TAPE.
 THE VIDEO YOU HAVE TO SEE TO
 BELIEVE.

        (VO) At Pro Plan,
 we believe nutrition is full of possibilities to improve
         your pet's life.

 MY GOODNESS.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL DO THIS
 FOR THE NEXT FOUR HOURS.
 [INDISCERNIBLE]
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 GET ME OUT OF HERE.
 [INDISCERNIBLE]
 I EAT SALAD, OK?
 I CANNOT SIT HERE.
 DR. OZ: PRETTY AWKWARD.
 THAT IS A SMALL TASTE OF WHAT
 GOT THE PASSENGER KICKED OFF A
 RECENT FLIGHT.
 SHE CALLED HER SEATMATE BIG PIG
 AMONG OTHER THINGS.
 TODAY, WE ARE EXPOSING FAT
 SHAMING CAUGHT ON TAPE.
 STRANGERS BULLYING AND VERBALLY
 ABUSING OTHERS BECAUSE OF THEIR
 WEIGHT.
 IT IS A MILITIAS -MALICIOUS
 AND DISTURBING ONLINE TREND.
 FAT SHAMING VIDEOS.
 A CAR FULL OF MEN STOPPED IN
 THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY ROAD JUST
 SO THEY COULD ROLL DOWN THE
 WINDOW AND SAY IT THE ICE CREAM
 YOU FAT [BLEEP]
 I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL DO
 THIS FOR THE NEXT FOUR HOURS.
 DR. OZ: UNRESTRAINED AND HURTFUL
 COMMENTS SHARED IMPOSTS -IN
 POSTS ARE LEAVING PEOPLE
 OUTRAGED AND SHOCKED.
 I WILL NOT BE VERBALLY
 ABUSED.
 YOU SAYING THAT TO ME COULD
 HAVE MADE ME GO KILL MYSELF.
 DR. OZ: SOME SHOW NO MERCY.
 WHEN YOU WANT TO DANCE AROUND
 WITH YOUR FAT ROLLS HANGING OUT
 AND SAYING YOU SHOULD LET ME FOR
 MY PERSONALITY AND NOT MY BODY,
 AND YOUR EATING UNHEALTHY, ALL
 OF A SUDDEN, EVERYONE IN THIS
 WORLD HAS SOME EXCUSE WHY THEY
 CANNOT BE HEALTHY.
 DR. OZ: HEAR FROM -THE PLAYBOY
 PLAYMATE SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN FAT
 SHAMING TO THE EXTREME POSTING
 THIS PICTURE OF A NAKED WOMAN
 WITH THE COMMENT, "IF I CAN'T
 AND SEE THIS -UNSEE THIS, YOU
 CAN'T EITHER."
 I CAN'T SIT HERE.
 WHY DON'T YOU [INDISCERNIBLE]
 KISS MY FAT [INDISCERNIBLE]
 DR. OZ: LOOKING AT THESE VIDEOS,
 YOU HAVE TO ASK WHAT DRIVES
 PEOPLE TO SUCH HATRED.
 THE WOMAN WHO RECORDED THE VIRAL
 VIDEO OF HER SEATMATE PUBLICLY
 FAT SHAMING HER JOINS ME NOW.
 THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE
 SHOW.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, DR.
 OZ.
 DR. OZ: GO BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED
 WHEN YOU FIRST GOT TO YOUR SEAT.
 REALIZING THIS WOMAN COMING
 INTO THE MIDDLE SEAT WAS HAVING
 A BAD DAY.
 SHE WAS NOT A HAPPY PERSON.
 VERBALLY SAYING NEGATIVE THINGS
 AND MAKING IT A LITTLE
 UNCOMFORTABLE.
 DR. OZ: HOW DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL
 WHEN YOU APPRECIATED WHAT SHE
 WAS REALLY GETTING AT?
 UNCOMFORTABLE, ANGRY.
 ANGRIER.
 AND MADDER.
 THAT IS WHY I STARTED DOING THE
 OUTBURST AND DECIDED TO DO A
 VIDEO.
 DR. OZ: SHE KEPT GOING EVEN WITH
 YOU RECORDING?
 YES.
 SHE KNEW THAT I WAS RECORDING.
 DR. OZ: WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO
 WANT TO POST IT?
 DOES PUT YOU AT RISK.
 THE WHOLE THING IS SO
 EMBARRASSING.
 OF COURSE, FOR HER, BECAUSE SHE
 IS DOING ALL OF THIS.
 I GUESS BECAUSE I AM A NURSE
 AND HAVE A PLATFORM, I THOUGHT
 BULLYING AND FAT SHAMING IS
 UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR FOR
 CHILDREN AND EVEN MORE THAN
 ADULTS.
 SO I FELT THE NEED TO SHOW IT
 HAPPENING.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: GOOD FOR YOU.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
 PRETENDED IT NEVER HAPPENED.
 YOU TRAVEL A LOT.
 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PUBLICLY
 SHAMED LIKE THIS?
 15 YEARS ON THE ROAD AND THIS
 WAS TRULY A FIRST.
 I AM ON THE ROAD ALMOST EVERY
 WEEK AND THIS WAS A FIRST.
 DR. OZ: YOU MUST HAVE AT SOME
 POINT BEEN DISBELIEVING THIS WAS
 HAPPENING.
 I DID.
 THERE WAS A DELAY.
 BUT SOMEBODY -BUT WHEN
 SOMEBODY ATTACKS IN PUBLIC, YOU
 CAN WALK AWAY.
 ON A PLANE, THERE IS NOWHERE TO
 WALK TO.
 DR. OZ: THE AIRLINE ULTIMATELY
 KICKED HER OFF.
 WHAT WAS THE REASON THEY GAVE
 FOR DOING THAT?
 THEY WERE SAYING THERE WERE
 SO MANY PEOPLE COMPLAINING
 BESIDES MYSELF.
 WHEN I GOT OFF THE PLANE, THERE
 WERE PEOPLE BEHIND ME THAT TOLD
 ME HER BEHAVIOR AFTER I STOPPED
 VIDEOTAPING WAS SHE WAS STILL
 RANTING SO THE AIRLINE HAD TO
 TAKE HER OFF THE PLANE FOR THE
 SAFETY OF ALL PASSENGERS.
 DR. OZ: IT WAS UNITED AIRLINES.
 HERE IS WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
 ABOUT THE INCIDENT.

 DR. OZ: SHE SPENT THE NIGHT WHERE EVER YOU WERE COMING FROM.
 WIDE DO YOU THINK THAT WOMAN WAS
 SO ANGRY?
 I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER KNOW
 WHY SHE BEHAVED THAT WAY AND WHY
 SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE
 BEHAVIOR.
 DR. OZ: YOU ARE BRAVE.
 YOUR BRAVE DESIRE TO SHARE THAT
 EXPENSE RESULTED IN A VIDEO THAT
 ATTRACTED 600,000 VIEWS IN A FEW
 WEEKS.
 IF YOU COULD TALK TO THAT WOMAN,
 AND THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE SHE
 MIGHT BE WATCHING THIS
 BROADCAST, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL
 HER?
 SHE NEEDS TO BE HEALED.
 SHE NEEDS TO LOOK INSIDE AND
 DETERMINE WHY SHE BEHAVED THAT
 WAY.
 WHAT IS HURTING INSIDE HERSELF
 THAT MAKES HER THINK IT IS OK TO
 HURT OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE HURT
 PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE.
 SHE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE
 DID WHAT SHE DID.
 I AM ON THE PATH OF FORGIVING
 HER BECAUSE AS A WOMAN OF GOD,
 THAT IS MY JOB, TO FORGIVE AND
 MOVE FORWARD.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THIS IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT
 WHICH IS WHY I AGREED TO COME
 ON.
 I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK
 MOMENT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE
 UNITED FLIGHT ATTENDANTS BECAUSE
 THEY DID AN AMAZING JOB, BUT FOR
 MY LANGUAGE I USED IN THE VIDEO,
 TO TELL THEM I'M SORRY FOR USING
 THAT LANGUAGE TOWARD THEM WHEN I
 WAS REFERRING TO THE OTHER
 WOMAN.
 DR. OZ: I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
 TO APOLOGIZE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: COMING UP, WHERE IS THE
 LINE BETWEEN FAT SHAMING AND
 CONCERN?
 WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU FEEL
 LIKE A DOCTOR IS FAT SHAMING[AP]

 Wow!
 That's Ensure Max Protein,

    If you have postmenopausal    osteoporosis
 and a high risk for fracture now might not be the best time
   to ask yourself are my bones   strong?
  Life is full of make or break  moments.
 That's why it's so important to
     help reduce your risk of     fracture with Prolia®.
  Only Prolia® is proven to help  strengthen and protect bones
 from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months.
 Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium,
 are pregnant, are allergic to it or take XGEVA®
   Serious allergic reactions,
 like low blood pressure trouble breathing;
 throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling rash;
 itching; or hives have happened.
  Tell your doctor about dental  problems
 as severe jaw bone problems may happen
  or new or unusual pain in your  hip groin, or thigh,
     as unusual thigh bone     fractures have occurred.
   Speak to your doctor before   stopping Prolia®
     as spine and other bone     fractures have occurred.
 Prolia® can cause serious side effects, like low blood calcium;
  serious infections which could  need hospitalization;
  skin problems; and severe bone  joint, or muscle pain.
          Are you ready?
 Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones.

 UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS THAT SHAMED A FEW YEARS AGO.
 I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AFTER A CAR
 ACCIDENT AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
 DO SOME WORK ON MY BACK.
 WHILE I WAS THERE, HE TOLD ME AT
 THE TIME, I WAS ALMOST 100
 POUNDS HEAVIER THAN NOW, HE TOLD
 ME I SHOULD HAVE BARIATRIC
 SURGERY BECAUSE I COULD NOT LOSE
 THE WEIGHT NATURALLY.
 I WAS GAINING WEIGHT LIKE
 CRAZY.
 I WOULD GO TO MY DOCTORS FOR
 HELP.
 ALL THEY WOULD SAY WAS TO
 WORKOUT HARDER AND EAT BETTER.
 THEY SAID I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A
 WEIGHT PROBLEM.
 THEY DISMISSED ALL OF MY OTHER
 SYMPTOMS AND SAID I WAS CRAZY.
 THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT EIGHT
 YEARS.
 I FINALLY DID MY OWN RESEARCH
 AND DISCOVERED I HAD A BRAIN
 TUMOR CAUSING ALL OF MY WEIGHT
 GAIN.
 A YEAR AGO, I HAD BRAIN SURGERY.
 I HAD A TUMOR REMOVED.
 SINCE THEN, I HAVE LOST 40
 POUNDS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH OUR
 INVESTIGATION INTO FAT SHAMING.
 COULD YOU BE FAT SHAMING BY YOUR
 OWN DOCTOR?
 WHERE IS THE LINE BETWEEN
 CONCERN AND FAT SHAMING?
 WHY IS THERE AN INCREASE?
 IT BREAKS MY HEART.
 THIS ABSOLUTELY BREAKS MY HEART
 AS A FAMILY DOCTOR.
 WE ARE DOCTORS.
 I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISED.
 I DO NOT THINK THIS IS NEW.
 I THINK WE ARE HEARING ABOUT IT
 MORE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WILLING
 TO TALK ABOUT IT AND RECORDED
 AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS.
 SOCIAL MEDIA HAS OPENED UP A
 PLATFORM TO SHARE OUR STORIES
 AND COMPARE EXPERIENCES.
 DR. OZ: GIVE THE AVERAGE PERSON
 WATCHING ADVICE AS A PHYSICIAN.
 HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR DOCTOR
 IS DOING HIS BEST BORDER
 CROSSING THE LINE INTO SHAMING
 -OR CROSSING THE LINE INTO
 SHAMING?
 TRUST YOUR GUT.
 IF IT DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT.
 IF YOU FEEL SHAMED OR
 EMBARRASSED, YOU KNOW WHAT?
 BELIEVE YOURSELF.
 BELIEVE HOW YOU FEEL.
 A DOCTOR WANTING TO DO THE RIGHT
 THING DOES NOT EXCUSE MAKING A
 PATIENT FEEL THAT WAY.
 THAT IS NEVER OK.
 IF YOU HAVE A DOCTOR THAT MAKES
 YOU FEEL THAT WAY OR YOU ARE NOT
 COMFORTABLE, I'M GIVING YOU
 PERMISSION TO FIND A NEW ONE.
 DR. OZ: STUDIES HAVE FOUND
 OVERWEIGHT WOMEN ARE LESS LIKELY
 THAN AVERAGE TO GET PREVENTATIVE
 CARE LIKE MAMMOGRAMS.
 THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS.
 BUT PEOPLE TREAT OVERWEIGHT
 PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY.
 WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY FOR A
 PHYSICIAN TO ADDRESS A PATIENT'S
 WEIGHT?
 AS PHYSICIANS, WE HAVE TO
 TALK ABOUT THIS.
 THESE ARE DISCRIMINATORY
 PRPRACTICES.
 IT IS WRONG.
 AS PHYSICIANS, WE NEED TO TALK
 WITH OUR PATIENTS.
 LET'S NOT TALK AT THEM, TALK TO
 THEM.
 ASK THEM QUESTIONS.
 TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING
 AND WHAT YOU HAVE TRIED, WHAT
 YOUR STORY IS.
 ASKING QUESTIONS IS KEY.
 THE IDEA OF NEVER DISMISSING
 SYMPTOMS BECAUSE OF WEIGHT.
 WE SHOULD NOT DISMISS PATIENT
 SYSTEMS --SYMPTOMS BECAUSE OF
 ANYTHING.
 WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE DOING DUE
 DILIGENCE.
 TO SAY IT IS YOUR WEIGHT OFF AND
 IS NEVER OK -OFFHAND IS NEVER
 OK IN MY OPINION.
 I AM A FAMILY DOCTOR.
 DO I TAKE SOMEONE'S BLOOD
 PRESSURE IN A PUBLIC SPACE WITH
 AIR TEMPERATURE?
 --FOR THEIR TEMPERATURE?
 NEVER.
 BUT SOMETIMES IN DOCTOR'S
 OFFICES, PEOPLE ARE WEIGHED IN
 PUBLIC PLACES LIKE THE WAITING
 ROOM.
 THIS SHOULD BE PRIVATE.
 THIS IS PERSONAL, PROTECTED
 INFORMATION.
 IT IS NO ONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.
 THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO
 MAKE THIS A MORE COMFORTABLE AND
 APPROPRIATE SITUATION.
 DR. OZ: I DON'T WANT YOU NOT
 GOING TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE YOU
 ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT.
 IT IS A NECESSARY TOPIC.
 MAKE SURE YOU TALK WITH THE
 DOCTOR.
 I WANT TO BRING IN THE NURSE WE
 MET EARLIER WHO WAS ON THE
 PLANE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY YOU
 THINK A PATIENT SHOULD BE ABLE
 TO ADDRESS THEIR DOCTOR IF THEY
 ARE WORRIED ABOUT WEIGHT ISSUES?
 LETTING THE DOCTOR KNOW THAT
 THIS IS NEW TO ME, THIS IS AN
 UNUSUAL FEELING.
 I HAVE BEEN FEELING LIKE THIS
 FOR TWO WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS,
 PUTTING A TIMEFRAME TO IT.
 IF THEY DOCTOR IS STILL NOT
 LISTENING TO YOU, CHANGE
 DOCTORS.
 ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

 I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THE
 LAUNCH OF MY ALL-NEW OZ GUIDE,

 PROBLEMS.
 OUR FIRST ISSUE WILL BE ON

 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: MONOUNSATURATED FATTY
 ACID OUR PLANT-BASED FATS.
 THE EASIEST WAY TO REMEMBER THEM
 ARE TO LOOK FOR HEALTHY FATS
 THAT ARE NOT FROM ANIMAL SOURCES
 SUCH AS AVOCADOS WERE NUTS AND
 SEEDS.
 THEY CAN REALLY FILL YOU UP.
 ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
 OLIVES.
 THERE WAS A STUDY DONE THROUGH
 THE AMERICAN DIABETIC
 ASSOCIATION THAT FOUND A DIET
 RICH IN THESE WORKS TO REDUCE
 BELLY FAT.
 IT IS A BIG DEAL.
 YOU DON'T WANT THESE FOODS
 GETTING BORING.
 THAT IS THE PROBLEM.
 I KNOW YOU ARE THINKING THAT.
 I HAVE BEEN HEARING REPORTS OF
 NUTS AND SEEDS FATIGUE.
 SHY AWAY FROM THIS PROBLEM.
 AND THEN THERE IS AVOCADO APATHY
 MAKING HEADLINES.
 AND THERE IS OLIVE MONOTONY.
 I HAVE CHALLENGED THREE BITE
 CLUB MEMBERS TO COME UP WITH NEW
 DELICIOUS RECIPES IN MY FIRST A
 WARDS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE'VE SPARED NO EXPENSE
 AS YOU CAN TELL.
 I HOPE YOU ARE IMPRESSED BY
 THAT.
 THEY WERE JUDGED BY TASTERS WHO
 WERE HARSH IN NATURE.
 PRIOR TO THE SHOW, THEY TASTED
 ALL OF THE FOODS.
 THE WINNER WILL TAKE HOME A
 COVETED FROZEN AVOCADO.

 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I AM EXCITED TO HEAR
 WHAT THEY MADE.
 WHAT DID YOU MAKE?
 I MADE A BURGER.
 I COMBINED MACADAMIA NUTS, ALMO
 NDS, CACHES, AND PECANS WITH A
 LOT OF SEEDS.
 PUMPKIN SEEDS, HELD SEATS,
 SESAME SEEDS, QUINOA, MUSHROOMS,
 AND OLIVES.
 DR. OZ: IT TASTES MEETING
 WITHOUT THE MEAT -MEATY
 WITHOUT THE MEAT.
 NICELY DONE.
 ROBERTA CAME UP WITH THE NEXT
 LEVEL WAY TO USE AVOCADOS.
 SECRET AGENT CHOCOLATE
 PUDDING.
 DR. OZ: VERY CLEVER.
 DIABOLICAL.
 AVOCADO IS A SECRET AGENT.
 IT IS GREAT WITH WINE.
 DR. OZ: IF YOU BROUGHT WINE, IT
 COULD INFLUENCE THE JUDGES.
 SO DECADENT AND  YOU WOULD
 NOT KNOW THERE IS AVOCADO IN IT.
 DR. OZ: THIS IS A STRONG
 COMPETITOR.
 BEFORE WE JUDGE, WE HAVE POWER
 -PAULA.
 WE HAVE TAHINI-FILLED HUMMUS.
 THESE ARE GLUTEN-FREE CRACKERS
 MADE FROM SEEDS.
 EVERYONE EATS HUMMUS.
 I LIGHTENED IT UP BY ADDING
 CAULIFLOWER.
 DR. OZ: YOU DID?
 THAT LOWERS THE POWER CAP.
 YOU CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
 -IT LOWERS THE CALORIE COUNT.
 AND DAIKON RADISH.
 TRY IT.
 DR. OZ: I LIKE THIS IDEA.
 YOU PUT A LOT OF GARLIC IN THIS.
 I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
 I DID.
 DR. OZ: ALL OF THESE YOU WILL
 LOSE WEIGHT WITH IF YOU EAT THEM
 THE RIGHT WAY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE
 AND DIFFICULT TASK OF REVEALING
 THE WINNER.
 ARE WE READY FOR THIS?
 NO HARD FEELINGS?
 I HAVE DELIBERATED WITH THE
 JUDGES AND THE PERSON TAKING
 HOME THE GOLDEN AVOCADO TODAY IS
 PAULA!
 MY GOODNESS.
 PAULA WINS!

 ME.
