 LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE THE LAST ONE.
 WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OURSELVES
 BETTER AND PUT OURSELVES IN THE
 BEST POSITION?
 THERE YOU GO.
 ENTIRE COUNTRY IS ROOTING FOR
 THOSE WOMEN.
 THE WHITE HOUSE JUST ANNOUNCED
 THEY'RE SENDING A DELEGATION
 OVER TO THE GAME IN FRANCE LED
 BY THE DEPARTMENT COMMERCE OF
 SECRETARY AND OTHERS.
 IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE.
 THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW
 AND THANK YOU ALL FOR WATCHING
 THIS HOUR OF MSNBC LIVE.
 CRAIG, WHERE ARE YOU WATCHING
 THE GAME?
 GO TEAM USA.
 I'LL BE WATCHING FROM THE COMFY
 CONFINES OF MY BASEMENT.
 VERY NICE.
 BIG SCREEN.
 LOVE IT.
 CRAIG MEDICAL SIN HERE, MSNBC
 HEADQUARTERS NEW YORK CITY.
 TANKS IN POSITION, PREPARATIONS
 UNDER WAY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 BIG FOURTH OF JULY EVENT,
 INCLUDING THOSE MILITARY
 VEHICLES NOW ON THE NATIONAL
 MALL AS NEW DETAILS ABOUT HOW
 IT'S BEING PAID FOR ARE
 GENERATING MORE FURRY.
 ALSO HAWKEYE SWING.
 2020 CANDIDATES MAKING THEIR WAY
 TO IOWA FOR THE HOLIDAY AS A NEW
 POLL OF VOTERS IN THAT STATE
 REVEALS SOME NEW CHALLENGES FOR
 SOME OF THOSE CONTENDERS.
 TWO OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS
 WILL JOIN ME LIVE THIS HOUR.
 TWO OF THEM.
 ALSO, TICKING TIME BOMB.
 THAT IS HOW ONE OFFICIAL IN A
 NEW GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG REPORT
 DESCRIBES THE HORRIFIC
 CONDITIONS INSIDE MIGRANT
 DETENTION FACILITIES.
 IT INCLUDES SHOCKING NEW IMAGES
 FROM INSIDE.
 WE'LL GET TO THAT STORY IN JUST
 A MOMENT.
 BUT WE START WITH THOSE TANKS
 AND MILITARY VEHICLES DESCENDING
 ON THE NATIONAL MALL FOR
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SELF-PRODUCED
 FOURTH OF JULY EVENT TOMORROW.
 IN A BREAK FROM TRADITION, THE
 PRESIDENT HAS ORDER A DISPLAY OF
 AMERICAN MILITARY MIGHT IN THE
 CAPITAL THAT.
 PLAN, ITS MEANING, AND ITS COST
 ALL STIRRING CONTROVERSY.
 JOINING ME NOW, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S
 MONICA ALBA LIVE ON THE NATIONAL
 MALL.
 ASHLEY PARKER WHITE HOUSE
 REPORTER FOR THE "WASHINGTON
 POST."
 AN MSNBC SENIOR POLITICAL
 ANALYST.
 DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN DON BAIRD
 IS WITH ME, HIS DISTRICT
 INCLUDES NORTH VIRGINIA.
 AND "WASHINGTON POST" OPINION
 RATE WRITER JENNIFER REUBEN AND
 MARK, PRESIDENTIAL HORN AND
 PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE LBJ
 FOUNDATION.
 QUITE ESTEEMED PANEL HERE.
 MONICA, I'LL START WITH YOU.
 WHAT ARE WE SEEING THERE ON THE
 MALL TODAY?
 SO, CRAIG, ACTUALLY IF I TURN
 HERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TWO
 BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLES.
 AND THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE
 MILITARY MIGHT THAT'S GOING TO
 BE ON DISPLAY TOMORROW EVENING.
 THIS IS, OF COURSE, BEING
 TRANSPORTED ON SUCH A LARGE
 FLATBED BECAUSE OF HOW HEAVY
 THEY ARE.
 THE ABRAMS TANKS WHICH ARE OTHER
 TANKS PARKED NEARBY AND GOING TO
 BE ON THE MALL WEIGH AS MUCH AS
 60 TONS.
 YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT'S SOMETHING
 THAT COULD DAMAGE D.C. STREETS
 AND SOME OF THE PRESIDENT'S
 CRITICS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN
 ABOUT THAT.
 BUT THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT
 WANTS ON DISPLAY.
 HE WANTS TO DO THE SALUTE TO
 AMERICA AND FEATURE ALL OF THESE
 DIFFERENT MILITARY VEHICLES
 AFTER BEING INSPIRED TWO YEARS
 AGO AT THE BASTILLE DAY
 CELEBRATIONS IN PARIS WHERE HE
 SAW THE PARADE WITH PRESIDENT
 EMMANUEL MACRON AND SAID I WOULD
 VERY MUCH LIKE TO DO THIS.
 HE THEN THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO
 BE TAKING PLACE ON VETERANS DAY,
 BUT THAT GOT CANCELED, YOU MAY
 REMEMBER, AND MOVED TO THE
 FOURTH OF JULY BECAUSE OF HOW
 EXPENSIVE IT IS.
 "THE WASHINGTON POST" IS
 REPORTING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE
 AT LEAST 2.5 MILLION IN ENTRANCE
 FEES REDIRECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR
 THE EVENT TOMORROW.
 AND OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
 THE COST IS YET OF THE OTHER
 MILITARY FLYOVERS.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED THAT A
 LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO BE FREE
 BECAUSE WE OWNERSHIP THE
 EQUIPMENT.
 BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE
 SECURITY AND OTHER CONCERNS,
 OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO
 KIND OF PUT THAT PRICE TAG UP
 HIGH.
 AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
 THAT'S GOING TO COST.
 NOW, THESE TANKS AND MILITARY
 VEHICLES ARE GOING TO BE MOVED.
 WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN,
 WE'RE JUST STEPS FROM THE
 LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
 BUT THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE
 PLACED UP AND DOWN THE MALL, BUT
 WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY
 THERE WILL BE.
 AND TOMORROW A LOT OF THE
 EXCITEMENT IS AROUND OF COURSE
 THE MILITARY FLYOVERS AND WHAT'S
 EXPECT TO BE A FLYOVER OF THE
 AIR FORCE ONE.
 BUT THAT'S THE SCENE FROM HERE
 THE DAY BEFORE.
 MONICA, THANK YOU.
 ASHLEY, YOUR PAPER REPORTING
 THAT THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
 IS DIVERTING $2.5 MILLION IN
 PARK FEES TO PAY FOR THIS.
 THE STORY ADDS, QUOTE, THE
 DIVERTED PARK FEES REPRESENT
 JUST A FRACTION OF THE EXTRA
 COSTS THE GOVERNMENT FACES AS A
 RESULT OF THE EVENT WHICH WILL
 INCLUDE DISPLAYS OF MILITARY
 HARDWARE, FLYOVERS BY JETS
 INCLUDING AIR FORCE ONE, THE
 DEPLOYMENT OF TANKS ON THE MALL,
 AND AN EXTENDED PYROTECHNIC
 SHOW.
 IS THERE A CONCERN AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE OF JUST THE SHEER OPTICS
 OF SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON
 THIS EXTRAVAGANZA AT THAT POINT?
 WELL, THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT A
 CONCERN FROM THE PRESIDENT.
 THIS IS WHAT HE WANTS.
 BUT YOU CAN SEE IN THAT TWEET HE
 SENT THAT HE IS CERTAINLY AWARE
 OF THE CRITICISM.
 THAT'S SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE
 HAS BEEN VERY COGNIZANT OF WHEN
 THE POST FIRST REPORTED, I
 BELIEVE, THAT THERE WERE GOING
 TO BE SORT OF A LONGER FIREWORKS
 DISPLAY THAN USUAL BECAUSE SOME
 COMPANIES HAD VOLUNTEERED TO
 HELP WITH THAT.
 ONE THING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE
 REALLY TRIED TO MAKE CLEAR WAS
 THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE WERE SORT
 OF NOT QUITE FREE FIREWORKS SHOW
 BUT AT A REDUCED RATE AND THAT
 THE PRESIDENT WOULD SORT OF BE
 FOOLISH NOT TO TAKE THESE
 COMPANIES UP ON THE OFFER.
 SO THEY'RE AWARE OF THIS
 CRITICISM.
 AND KEEP IN MIND, YOU MENTIONED
 THIS EARLIER, BUT THE WHOLE
 REASON THAT HIS PLANS FOR A
 VETERANS' DAY PARADE WERE
 SCUTTLED WAS BECAUSE THE PRICE
 TAG GOT TO ABOUT 90 MILLION.
 IT WAS JUST WAY TOO HIGH, THERE
 WAS A TON OF OUTCRY INCLUDING
 THE D.C. GOVERNMENT, IT WAS NOT
 FEASIBLE.
 THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT CARE,
 NECESSARILY, HE'S CLEARLY
 PROCEEDING FULL STEAM AHEAD.
 BUT THAT TWEET SHOWS IN OTHER
 CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE
 WHITE HOUSE SHOWS THAT THEY ARE
 AT LEAST AWARE THAT THERE IS A
 NUMBER -- THERE'S A LOT OF
 CRITICISM COMING FROM ALL SIDES.
 ASHLEY, WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW
 ABOUT THIS REPORTING ON THE
 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
 THEY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF VIP
 TICKETS THAT THEY'RE HANDING OUT
 AS WELL.
 ARE THEY HANDING OUT TICKETS TO
 A TAX-PAYER FUNDED EVENT?
 WELL, THERE'S CONCERN --
 THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FAIR
 CRITICISM ABOUT THAT FOR SORT OF
 POLITICIZING, YOU KNOW, ONE OF
 THESE RARE THINGS IN THE NATION
 THAT IS APOLITICAL, A HOLIDAY
 THAT IS SYMBOLIC AND ABOUT
 FIREWORKS AND SPENDING TIME WITH
 FAMILIES AND BARBECUES.
 THEY'VE TRIED TO ARGUE THIS IS
 NO DIFFERENT THAN SOMETIMES
 TICKETS ARE HANDED OUT FOR SAY
 THE EASTER EGG ROLL OR SOMETHING
 ELSE ON THE SOUTH LAWN.
 BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IS
 WORTH MENTIONING THAT WE'RE
 HEARING IS THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF
 KIND OF QUIET CHATTER IN THE
 PRESIDENT'S ORBIT THAT THEY'RE
 DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT ANOTHER
 INAUGURATION FIASCO.
 NO ONE'S GOING TO SHOW UP.
 THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CROWDS
 WERE NOT AS BIG AS HIS
 PREDECESSORS, EXACTLY, NO ONE
 WILL SHOW UP.
 WHAT HAPPENS IF IT RAINS?
 PEOPLE IN A DEEPLY BLUE DISTRICT
 WHO ARE NOT FANS OF THE
 PRESIDENT ARE FLEEING TOWN.
 PART OF THAT IT SEEMS IS
 DESIGNED TO KIND OF ENSURE THAT
 AT LEAST FOR THE CAMERA SHOT
 THAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS PACKED
 AND THERE'S NOT THESE SORT OF
 SPLOTCHES OF GREEN GRASS WHERE
 THE PRESIDENT WANTS A HUGE CROWD
 BEHIND HIM CELEBRATING HIM.
 MARK, GIVE US SOME
 PERSPECTIVE HERE.
 HOW UNUSUAL IS IT TO HAVE A
 MILITARY DISPLAY AND FOR A
 PRESIDENT TO SPEAK FROM THE MALL
 IN THE WAY THAT HE IS REPORTEDLY
 GOING TO ON INDEPENDENCE DAY?
 UNPRECEDENTED OR NOT?
 WELL, LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING
 THIS PRESIDENT DOES, THIS IS

 UNPRECEDENTED.
 THIS IS THE KIND OF MILITARY
 DISPLAY WE WERE USED TO SEEING
 FROM THE SOVIET UNION ON MAY
 DAY.
 THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DO AS A
 NATION.
 WE HAVE FIREWORKS AND PARADES,
 BUT WE DON'T SHOW OUR MILITARY
 HARDWARE TO THE NATION AND TO
 THE WORLD.
 I THINK THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO
 VERY MUCH WANTS TO BE SEEN AS A
 STRONG MAN, NOT ONLY TO HIS OWN
 CITIZENS, BUT TO CITIZENS OF THE
 WORLD.
 SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT
 DONALD TRUMP WOULD WANT TO DO A
 DISPLAY LIKE THIS.
 CONGRESSMAN BEYER, YOU
 REPRESENT VIRGINIA'S EIGHTH
 DISTRICT, HOME THE PENTAGON,
 YOU'RE JUST ACROSS THE RIVER
 FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.
 WHAT'S YOUR OBJECTION TO WHAT
 THE PRESIDENT HAS PLANNED FOR
 THE FOURTH?
 MELVIN, I HAVE THREE BIG.
 FIRST THAT HE'S TAKING SOMETHING
 THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN BIPARTISAN, I
 GREW UP IN THE CITY AND MY DAD
 WOULD LOAD THE SIX KIDS OF US,
 TAKE US DOWN TO THE MALL WITH
 THE BLANKET AND THE PICNIC
 BASKET AND NOW IT'S TURNED INTO
 THIS MAJOR PARTISAN THING.
 I'M STILL ENCOURAGING OUR FOLKS
 DO BECAUSE I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
 DIVISIVE.
 I OBJECT TO THE MILITARIZATION.
 WHEN I THINK OF TROOPS WALKING
 DOWN THE MIDDLE, I'M THINKING
 RED SQUARE NORTH KOREA, EGYPT,
 NOT THE UNITED STATES WHERE
 WE'RE GOING TO SPEND 3-QUARTERS
 OF A TRILLION DOLLARS ON OUR
 MILITARY.
 EVERYONE KNOWS WE'RE THE MOST
 POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
 YOU ALSO, AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
 YOU ARE CALLING FOR THE
 PRESIDENT TO PERSONALLY
 REIMBURSE TAXPAYERS FOR ANY

 INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE CAUSED BY
 MILITARY HARDWARE BROUGHT IN FOR
 THE CELEBRATION.
 I THINK YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE
 PRESIDENT'S NOT GOING TO DO
 THAT, BUT WHAT IS YOUR GOAL WITH
 THAT DEMAND?
 WELL, HE'S FAMOUS FOR NOT
 PAYING HIS BILLS.
 I THINK HE STILL OWES THE
 DISTRICT $53 MILLION UNREIMBURSE
 FROM THE INAUGURATION.
 IT'S JUST TO MAKE THE POINT THAT
 WHEN YOU TAKE THESE VERY
 WEIGHTY, 60-TON ABRAMS TANKS AND
 PUT THEM NEXT TO THE LINCOLN
 MEMORIAL, WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S
 DOING TO D.C. ROADS.
 THERE'S SOME CONCERN FROM THE
 PARK SERVICE THAT THE BASEMENTS
 UNDER THE MEMORIAL MAY NOT BE
 ABLE TO HOLD THIS UP.
 IT'S JUST AT A TIME WHEN THE
 PARK SERVICE HAS AN 11 OR
 $12 BILLION INFRASTRUCTURE
 BACKLOG TO BE REDIRECTING FUNDS
 FOR HIS VANITY SHOW, JUST
 DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
 CONGRESSMAN BEYER, I
 APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, SIR.
 THANK YOU.
 TO BE CLEAR, YOU'RE GOING TO GO?
 YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE?
 I'M GOING TO GO ON THE
 EASTERN SHORE WITH MY FAMILY SO,
 NO, I WILL NOT BE THERE.
 YOU'LL BE WATCHING ON
 TELEVISION.
 NOT OUT OF PROTEST.
 PREVIOUSLY PLANNED.
 BUT YOU'RE ENCOURAGING YOUR
 CONSTITUENTS TO GO.
 YEAH.
 ONLY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE'S THE
 MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENT WE'VE
 HAD.
 BUT ONE OF OUR GREAT CHALLENGES
 IS WE LIVE IN A DIVIDED COUNTRY
 AND WE NEED TO DO OUR BEST TO
 HEAL.
 AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO
 HIS SPEECH BUT THEY SHOULD ENJOY
 THE FIREWORKS.
 WHY ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO IF
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, IF I WERE IN
 TOWN I PROBABLY WOULD BUT MY
 WIFE AND KIDS ARE ALREADY ON THE
 EASTERN SHORE.
 GOT IT.
 CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
 TIME.
 JENNIFER, I WANT TO CALL YOUR
 ATTENTION TO THIS SURVEY.
 THERE'S A SURVEY OF AMERICAN
 PRIDE.
 IT'S FROM GALLOP.
 AND ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY, 45%
 OF FOLKS WHO ARE POLLED ARE
 PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN.
 THAT'S THE SECOND STRAIGHT YEAR
 OF THE SUB50 RATINGS THAT.
 PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN WEAKENING IN
 RECENT YEARS.
 TO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE
 DROP.
 FIRST OF ALL I WANT BE GOING
 TO THE MALL AND IT WON'T BE IN
 PROTEST.
 GOOD FOR THE CONGRESSMAN, HE'S A
 BETTER PERSON THAN I.
 I THINK PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY
 DISTURBED WITH WHAT THIS
 PRESIDENT HAS BEEN DOING TO OUR
 DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.
 TO THE RULE OF LAW, TO THE
 CELEBRATION OF POWERS, HIS
 DISRESPECT FOR THE FIRST
 AMENDMENT CALLING THE PRESS THE
 ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.
 FOR BETTER OR WORSE, THE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 EMBODIES THE COUNTRY TO SOME
 DEGREE.
 HE IS BOTH THE HEAD OF STATE AND
 THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT.
 AND WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT DONALD
 TRUMP AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE ON
 THE WORLD STAGE, THEY ARE NOT
 PROUD OF HIM.
 THEY FIND HIM TACKY, THEY FIND
 HIM CRUDE, RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC,
 MISOGYNISTIC, YOU CAN GO DOWN
 THE LIST.
 AND I THINK THAT DEEPLY WORRIES
 PEOPLE.
 I THINK YOU SEE THIS IN THE
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL RACE
 WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE
 ESSENTIALLY RUNNING ON A
 PLATFORM TO RESTORE AMERICAN
 VALUES OF DECENCY,
 INCLUSIVENESS, GENEROSITY,
 COMMUNITY.
 BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT
 FROM THIS PRESIDENT.
 HE'S NOTORIOUSLY AWFUL ON THESE
 MOMENTS WHEN YOU LOOK TO THE
 PRESIDENT TO HEAL, TO BRING US
 TOGETHER, HE'S THE ANTIUNITER.
 AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE
 DISPLAY.
 IT'S ALSO REALLY A CONTEMPT FOR
 GOVERNMENT.
 THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL HATCH
 ACT VIOLATIONS.
 THIS IS USING THE TAXPAYERS'
 MONEY, THE TAXPAYERS' PROPERTY
 REALLY FOR HIS OWN VANITY.
 AND WHETHER IT'S A LEGAL
 VIOLATION OR NOT, IT IS SO
 UNSEEMLY.
 AND I WOULD JUST ADD ONE FINAL
 THING.
 SEEING TANKS ON THE MALL HAS THE
 APPEARANCE THAT WASHINGTON IS AN
 OCCUPIED CITY.
 WE PUT TANKS ON THE STREET WHEN
 THERE'S A CIVIL UPRISING, WHEN
 THERE'S A CALAMITY OF SOME TYPE.
 THERE IS NOT.
 AND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T GET
 THAT THIS IS NOT A SYMBOL OF
 PRIDE OR OF AMERICA, BUT THIS
 THAT IS A DEEPLY DISTURBING SIGN
 THAT HE IS POLITICIZING THE
 MILITARY AND MILL TAR MILITARYI
 COUNTRY.
 ARE WE AT A POINT WHERE WE
 CAN'T SEPARATE OUR PATRIOTISM
 FROM THE PRESIDENT?
 I THINK THOSE PLUNGING
 NUMBERS AROUND AMERICAN PRIDE
 ARE TOTALLY REFLECTIVE OF THE
 FACT THAT WE'RE IN A POLARIZED
 NATION.
 WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS
 LEADING THROUGH DIVISION AND
 DISCORD.
 YOU'RE SEEING THAT NUMBER
 INCREASE SLIGHTLY AMONG
 REPUBLICANS AND PLUNGE AMONG
 DEMOCRATS.
 WE'RE A VERY DIVIDED SOCIETY.
 BUT I WORRY TOO WHAT RONALD
 REAGAN WARNED ABOUT IN HIS
 FAREWELL ADDRESS.
 HE TALKED ABOUT THE ERADICATION
 OF THE AMERICAN MEMORY AND EAT
 RECOGNITION OF THE AMERICAN
 SPIRIT.
 BY WHICH HE MEANT WE ARE NOT --
 WE ARE NOT STUDYING CIVICS AND
 HISTORY IN OUR SCHOOLS ANYMORE.
 WE'RE LOOKING ONLY AT THE MOMENT
 RIGHT NOW IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
 AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP MEANS TO
 AMERICA, NOT THE LARGER AMERICAN
 STORY.
 I THINK IF AMERICANS, MORE
 AMERICANS WERE TO UNDERSTOOD
 MORE ABOUT CIVICS AND AMERICAN
 HISTORY, THEY WOULD HAVE PRIDE
 IN OUR NATION KNOWING THAT
 SOMETIMES WE GO THROUGH GOOD
 TIMES AND SOMETIMES WE GO
 THROUGH BAD TIMES, BUT WE ARE A
 STRONG AND RESILIENT NATION
 ULTIMATELY.
 ON THIS EVE OF THE FOURTH OF
 JULY, THAT SEEMS AN APPROPRIATE
 SPOT TO END IT.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT,
 MARK.
 THANK YOU, ASHLEY, THANK YOU
 JENNIFER, AND THANK YOU MONICA.
 DO APPRECIATE YOUR REPORTING.
 DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.
 CHILDREN LAYING ON TOP OF EACH
 OTHER.
 CELLS PACKED AT FIVE TIMES THEIR
 CAPACITY.
 NEW IMAGES BEING RELEASED AS
 PART OF A GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG
 REPORT ON CONDITIONS INSIDE
 THOSE MIGRANT DETENTION
 FACILITIES.
 IT'S TRIGGERING MORE OUTRAGE

 CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
 I'LL TALK ABOUT IT WITH ONE OF
 THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CONTENDERS WASHINGTON GOVERNOR
 JAY INSLEE WILL JOIN ME ON THE
 OTHER SIDE OF THIS BREAK.
 LATER IN THIS HOUR, ANOTHER
 CONTEND ARE, OHIO CONGRESSMAN

 A DISTURBING NEW REPORT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR
 GENERAL HIGHLIGHTS THE
 CONDITIONS MIGRANTS ARE FACING
 AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER.
 IT INCLUDES IMAGES OF PEOPLE AT
 A RIO GRANDE VALLEY DETENTION
 CENTER CRAMMED INTO HOLDING
 CELLS, SLEEPING ON CONCRETE
 FLOORS.
 ONE SENIOR MANAGER AT THAT
 FACILITY CALLS THE SITUATION A,
 QUOTE, TICKING TIME BOMB.
 OFFICIALS FOUND ADULTS AND
 CHILDREN LIVING WITH LIMITED
 ACCESS TO SHOWERS.
 AND ACCORDING TO THAT REPORT,
 QUOTE, AT ONE FACILITY SOME
 SINGLE ADULTS WERE HELD IN
 STANDING ROOM ONLY CONDITIONS
 FOR A WEEK AND AT ANOTHER SOME
 SINGLE ADULTS WERE HELD FOR MORE
 THAN A MONTH IN OVERCROWDED
 CELLS.
 JOINING ME NOW LIVE FROM
 SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, GOVERNOR
 AND POLITICAL -- EXCUSE ME,
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATE JAY INSLEE.
 GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
 TIME.
 AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
 ABOUT THESE DETENTION
 FACILITIES?
 HOW WOULD THEY CHANGE?
 WE WOULD SHOP THE GROSS
 INHUMANITY.
 YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH
 AND DEPRAVITY OF DONALD TRUMP.
 THESE CONDITIONS ARE AN
 INTENTIONAL ACTION BY HIM.
 HE HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
 HE WANTS TO MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID
 AND HE LIKES THESE INHUMANE
 CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT IS PART OF
 HIS INTENTION TO FAN THE FLAME
 OF DISCORD AROUND HIM
 AGGREGATION.

 IMMIGRATION.
 AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ADDRESS
 THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS
 IMMIGRATION PROBLEM TO KEEP
 PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE AND NOT
 FORCE THEM TO COME NORTH, HE HAS
 DECIDED TO UTILIZE INHUMANE
 CONDITIONS AS A TOOL OF HIS
 GROSS CRUELTY.
 WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW DEEP
 THIS DEPRAVITY IS.
 SO WE NEED TO HAVE BOTH
 ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE,
 BUT WE NEED TO GO BACK WHAT
 WE'VE DONE FOR 50 YEARS AS A
 JUDGE ORDERED YESTERDAY IN
 SEATTLE, TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE
 RELEASED ON BOND IN THE
 APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES
 WHEREAS MUCH AS 80 OR 90% OF
 PEOPLE DO RETURN FOR THEIR
 IMMIGRATION HEARINGS.
 WE'VE DONE THAT FOR 50 YEARS IN
 AMERICA.
 HE HAS DEPARTED FROM AMERICAN
 TRADITION.
 WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THAT.
 ON LAST NIGHT, FELLOW
 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FORMER
 HOUSING SECRETARY JULIAN CASTRO
 APPEARED ON RACHEL MADDOW AND HE
 LAID OUT HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN.
 LISTEN HAVE SOME I'M GOING TO
 OFFER A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
 VISION ON WHAT WE SHOULD DO ON
 IMMIGRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
 HAVE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
 THAT'S FIXED, THAT WORKS WITH
 BORDER SECURITY, BUT THAT NEVER
 TREATS PEOPLE LIKE THIS AGAIN.
 I BELIEVE ONE CENTERPIECE OF
 THAT IS REPEALING SECTION 1325
 OF THE IMMIGRATION NATIONAL ALT
 ACT SO THAT NOT ONLY THIS
 PRESIDENT, BUT FUTURE PRESIDENTS
 CAN'T EVER USE THAT LAW TO
 INCARCERATE PARENTS AND SEPARATE
 THEM FROM THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN.
 DO YOU AGREE WITH HIS STANCE
 THAT CROSSING THE BORDER
 ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE
 CRIMINALIZED?
 WE SHOULD NOT USE CRIMINAL
 STATUTES TO SEPARATE CHILDREN
 FROM THEIR PARENTS, PERIOD.
 AND IF THAT'S BEING USED FOR
 THAT PURPOSE, IT SHOULD NOT BE
 USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.
 AND IS NOT REQUIRED.
 LOOK, WE HAVE LOTS OF CIVIL
 SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT
 ILLEGAL ENTRY INTO THE UNITED
 STATES.
 AND TO USE DONALD TRUMP'S
 SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM
 PARENTS, WHICH HE HAS DONE
 INTENTIONALLY, SHOULD NOT BE
 ALLOWED THROUGH CRIMINAL
 STATUTES IN THE UNITED STATES.
 AND I WANT TO REPEAT, LOOK, FOR
 50 YEARS WE'VE HAD A SYSTEM OF
 BEING ABLE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO
 HAVE A HEARING ON ASYLUM WITHOUT
 SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR
 PARENTS.
 WE NEED TO RESTORE THAT BASIC
 AMERICAN VALUE.
 I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING
 FROM THE NEW "WASHINGTON POST,"
 ABC NEWS POLL THAT WAS TAKEN
 SINCE LAST WEEKS NBC DEBATE.
 29% OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS SAY
 HEALTHCARE IS ONE OF THE MOST
 IMPORTANT ISSUES THEY'RE GOING
 TO BE VOTING ON.
 TOP OF THE LIST, IN FACT.
 YOU HAVE RELIED HEAVILY ON
 CLIMATE CHANGE.
 YOU'VE DRILLED DOWN ON CLIMATE
 CHANGE.
 WHAT DO YOU OFFER VOTERS WHO ARE
 LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO TACKLE
 OUR NATION'S HEALTHCARE ISSUES?
 WELL, WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH IN
 OUR STATE SUCCESSFULLY, NOT JUST
 IN CLIMATE -- ADDRESSING THE
 CLIMATE CRISIS.
 WE'VE ADOPTED THE VERY FIRST
 PUBLIC HEALTH OPTION IN THE
 UNITED STATES.
 WE'RE PROUD OF THAT.
 I'M THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO
 ACTUALLY WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY
 TO PASS THOSE BILLS.
 BUT WE'VE DONE SO MUCH ON OUR
 OTHER ISSUES TO HELP FAMILIES
 HEALTH.
 HEALTH IS NOT JUST THE
 HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, YOU'VE GOT TO
 HAVE A FAMILY WAGE.
 THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO SAY
 WE'VE ADOPTED WHILE I'M GOVERNOR
 THE HIGHEST MINIMUM WAGE IN THE
 UNITED STATES.
 YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE
 OF YOUR FAMILY WHEN THEY'RE
 SICK.
 THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE MOST
 ROBUST MEDICAL FAMILY LEAVE IN
 THE UNITED STATES.
 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DECENT WAGE
 IN GENERAL, THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD
 OF WE'VE WON THE HIGHEST
 EDUCATOR COMPENSATION INCREASE
 FOR OUR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS
 IN THE UNITED STATES.
 WE HAVE WRAPAROUND SERVICES OF
 BEING ABLE TO BUILD A MID-MIDDLE
 CLASS.
 THAT'S HOW YOU REALLY HAVE
 HEALTH.
 BUT I DO WANT TO COME BACK TO
 THIS ISSUE.
 LOOK, THIS IS A HEALTH ISSUE OF
 THIS CLIMATE CRISIS.
 IT'S INCREASING LYME DISEASE,
 IT'S RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, IT'S
 AN EPIDEMIC OF AS ASTHMA.
 THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS A HEALTH
 ISSUE AND I'M OFFERING A UNIQUE
 EMPHASIS TON.
 I AM THE CANDIDATE AND SO FAR
 THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO SAID THIS
 WILL BE THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
 OF THE UNITED STATES.
 IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE, IT'S AN
 ECONOMIC ISSUE ALL ROLLED IN
 ONE.
 IT'S YOUR CENTRAL MESSAGE.
 YOU BET.
 THE LATEST MSNBC POLL SHOWS
 YOUR MOVEMENT OVER THE LAST FOUR
 MONTHS, IT SHOWS IN MARCH,
 APRIL, AND JUNE YOU WERE
 REGISTERING AT ABOUT 1%.
 IN THE MOST RECENT PERCENT
 YOU'RE NOT AT AN AS SPER RISK.

  ASTERISK?
 IS IT THAT MESSAGE OR IS IT
 ABOUT THE MESS SEN JER.
 WHERE WE'RE CLINTON AND
 CARTER WERE WHEN THEY STARTED.
 WE'RE STILL INTRODUCING
 OURSELVES TO THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE.
 LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE
 COULD PICK ME OUT OF A LINEUP IN
 THE IS A START.
 WE'VE HAD SOME CONFIDENCE SINCE
 THE LAST DEBATE.
 WE HAD A SURGE OF SUPPORT.
 WE HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF
 DONORS IN 24 HOURS SINCE I
 STARTED.
 WE HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF NEW
 DONORS.
 AND WE ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO GO TO
 JNZ.COM IF THEY WANT TO SEE THE
 CLIMATE CRISIS TO REMAIN A
 CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE DEBATE.
 YOU'RE TALKING NUMBERS HERE,
 YOU'VE GOT SOME FUNDRAISING
 NUMBERS FOR US?
 YEAH.
 THEY'RE GOING UP.
 I DON'T HAVE A TOTAL NUMBER FOR
 YOU.
 I HAVEN'T TOTALED THEM FOR THE
 QUARTER.
 BUT WE DID HAVE THE BEST DAY,
 THE BEST TWO DAYS THAT WE'VE HAD
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN AFTER THE
 LAST DEBATE.
 AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE
 WANT TO SEE THE CLIMATE CRISIS
 FRONT AND CENTER.
 YESTERDAY SENATOR SANDERS PUT
 OUT HIS NUMBERS, HE WAS AROUND
 24 MILLION.
 PETE PUT OUT HIS NUMBERS AROUND
 24 MILLION.
 ARE YOU AT 24 MILLION.
 NO.
 BY THE WAY, I WAS HONORED THE
 OTHER DAY, SOMEONE EVALUATED OUR
 RESPECTIVE CLIMATE PLANS AND
 OURS WAS HELD TO BE NUMBER ONE,
 I'M PROUD OF THAT.
 I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY
 IS FOR OUR NATION TO ADDRESS
 SOMETHING THAT'S BURNING DOWN
 OUR TOWNS AND PLANNED TOING OUR
 FIELDS.
 ALL RIGHT.
 AND IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE
 THAT, THEY CAN GO TO JNZ.COM.
 GOVERNOR INSLEE, THANK YOU.
 YOU BET.

 RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES ARE SWARMING IOWA
 PREPARING FOR A LONG HOLIDAY
 WEEKEND.
 THERE'S A LOOK AT THEM THERE.
 NEW POLL FROM THE "WASHINGTON
 POST" AND ABC NEWS SHEDS SOME
 LIGHT ON HOW THEY ARE STACKING
 UP AT THIS EARLY POINT IN THE
 RACE.
 AND THE LATEST POLL SINCE THE
 NBC NEWS DEBATE, JOE BIDEN'S
 LEAD OVER HIS CLOSEST COMPETITOR
 SHRANK TO JUST SIX POINT.
 BERNIE SANDERS HOLDING ON TO THE
 SECOND SPOT IN THE POLL.
 ELIZABETH WARREN HOLDING STEADY
 AT 11%.
 BIGGEST JUMP, SENATOR KAMALA
 HARRIS ALSO AT 11%.
 BUT THIS POLL IS UNIQUE BECAUSE
 IT ALSO ASKS -- IT ASKS VOTERS
 FOR A SECOND CHOICE.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHETHER ONE OF
 THESE CANDIDATES IS SOMEONE'S
 FIRST OR SECOND CHOICE, JOE
 BIDEN HAS THE SUPPORT OF HALF
 THE PRIMARY VOTERS AND THAT'S
 WITH MORE THAN 20 PEOPLE IN THIS
 RACE.
 SANDERS HITS 40%, ELIZABETH
 WARREN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE,

 KAMALA HARRIS RIGHT THERE AS
 WELL, 24%.
 WE HAVE TWO ROAD WARRIORS
 COVERING TWO OF THE BIGGEST
 MOVERS IN ALL OF THESE POLLS
 RIGHT NOW.
 MIKE IS COVERING THE BIDEN
 CAMPAIGN, IS HE IN CEDAR RAPIDS,
 IOWA.
 VAUGHN HILLYARD COVERING THE
 HARRIS CAMPAIGN IN DES MOINES,
 IOWA.
 MIKE, I'LL START WITH YOU IF THE
 THIS IS BIDEN'S FIRST CAMPAIGN
 RALLY SINCE THOSE DEBATES.
 WHAT'S THE PLAN?
 WELL, CRAIG, THERE'S NO DOUBT
 THAT A LOT HAS CHANGED FOR THE
 BIDEN CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF WHAT IS
 HIS THIRD TRIP TO IOWA SINCE
 ANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY IN
 APRIL.
 HE WAS BEHIND ME HERE IN CEDAR
 RAPIDS ON THAT FIRST TRIP IN
 APRIL SAYING AT THE TIME THAT NO
 ONE WAS GOING TO WORK HARDER
 THAN HIM TO WIN THE SUCH IOWA
 VOTERS.
 THAT SECOND TRIP TO IOWA, YOU'LL
 REMEMBER HE WAS HERE AT THE SAME
 TIME AS PRESIDENT PRESIDENT
 TRUMP.
 GAVE BIDEN AND OPPORTUNITY TO
 FRAME THAT GENERAL ELECTION
 MATCHUP, OF COURSE ELECTABILITY
 BEING ONE OF THE STRONGEST
 ARGUMENTS THAT HE HAS SO FAR.
 BUT AS I SAID, THERE'S NO DOUBT
 WHEN YOU TALK TO BIDEN ADVISERS
 THEY FEEL THE GAME HAS CHANGED.
 GAME ON AS ONE ADVISER SAID.
 YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE POLLS
 THAT SHOW HIM SLIPPING AFTER
 THAT SHAKY DEBATE PERFORMANCE.
 SENIOR BIDEN CAMPAIGN ADVISER
 TELLS ME WE'RE NO MORE WORRIED
 ABOUT THESE LATEST POLLS THAT
 SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF A DIP THAN
 THEY WERE OVERCONFIDENT BASED ON
 THE INITIAL POLLS THAT SHOWED
 HIM WITH A STRONG LEAD.
 BUT WE ARE SEEING HIM RECOGNIZE
 THAT HE CAN'T JUST STAY ABOVE
 THE FRAY IN TERMS OF THE RUN THE
 IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.
 WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING, WE'RE
 GOING TO SEE HIM CAMPAIGNING ON
 THE FOURTH OF JULY TOMORROW IN
 INDEPENDENCE, IOWA, AT THE SAME
 TIME AS BETO O'ROURKE.
 ANOTHER ONE OF HIS CONTENDERS.
 ALSO, CRAIG, TOMORROW NIGHT JOE
 BIDEN WILL ALSO BE ATTENDING AN
 IOWA/CUBS GAME WITH BETO AROARK.
 WHICH MEANS I GET PAID TO ATTEND
 A BASEBALL GAME.
 GOOD POINT.
 MR. HILLYARD, HOW ARE THEY GOING
 TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS?
 SHE'LL BE JUST NEXT DOOR IN
 WEST DES MOINES THIS AFTERNOON
 AND THEN SHE'LL BE GOING FROM
 IOWA TO TO NEW ORLEANS AND IN
 SOUTH CAROLINA NEXT WEEK.
 ESSENTIALLY SHE'S NOT GOING TO
 LET UP OFF THE GAS.
 SHE'S GOING TO GO FORWARD.
 AND THIS IS PART OF THE
 CAMPAIGN'S EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO
 SHOW THE CONTRAST OF WHAT KAMALA
 HARRIS CAN BRING TO THE CAMPAIGN
 TRAIL.
 SHE PLANS TO GO FULL ON.
 THEY NOW HAVE 65 STAFFERS HERE
 ON THE GROUND IN IOWA.
 AND AS MIKE JUST MENTIONED, THE
 DEBATE WAS A WAKEUP CALL FOR THE
 BIDEN CAMPAIGN, THAT HE COULDN'T
 STAY ABOVE THE FRAY.
 BECAUSE WHAT LAST WEEK SHOWED IS
 THIS IS GOING TO BE A DEMOCRATIC
 PRIMARY IN WHICH CANDIDATES WILL
 SHOW CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM.
 KAMALA HARRIS NOT ONLY ON ISSUES
 OF RACE AND BUSING, BUT ALSO ON
 THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S
 DEPORTATION POLICIES.
 I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU A LITTLE
 BIT OF SOUND.
 THIS WAS ACTUALLY FROM JUST OVER
 A WEEK AGO WHEN KAMALA HARRIS
 WAS OVER IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
 I THINK IT'S VERY PERTINENT TO
 WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TO HEAR
 FROM THE CALIFORNIA SENATOR
 TODAY AND IN THE WEEKS AHEAD.
 WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO AS
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO REBUILD
 THE PARTY.
 WHO UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO GIVE
 THE RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT TO
 THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE GROUND
 EVERY DAY DOING THE HARD WORK.
 WE CAN'T JUST HELICOPTER IN
 HERE.
 WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE
 WHO ARE ON THE GROUND WHO KNOW
 THE COMMUNITY.
 KAMALA HARRIS IN THAT DEBATE
 MADE HERSELF VULNERABLE TO
 FOLKS, TO VOTERS WHO SAY THEY
 ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT DEMOCRATS
 ATTACK ONE ANOTHER.
 BUT WHAT SHE DID AT THE SAME
 TIME AND WHAT THE POLLS ARE
 INDICATING, SHE SEPARATED
 HERSELF AS A WILLINGNESS TO
 PAINT CONTRAST BETWEEN HER AND
 OTHERS.
 AND AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM HER
 THERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHAT WE
 SHOULD EXPECT TO HEAR FROM HER
 HERE IN IOWA IS THAT SHE IS
 MAINTAINING SHE IS THE CANDIDATE
 THAT'S LOOKING FORWARD AND WILL
 OUTWORK THE REST OF THE FIELD.
 CRAIG.
 ALL RIGHT.
 VAUGHN HILLYARD THERE IN DES
 MOINES.
 THANK YOU.
 AND MIKE, THANK YOU AS WELL,
 SIR.
 WILL THEY OR WON'T THEY?
 A NEW TWEET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
 JUST MOMENTS AGO APPEARS TO
 CONTRADICT HIS OWN
 ADMINISTRATION ON A CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION ON THE CENSUS.
 WE'RE GOING TO DIG INTO THAT.
 IT'S A DEVELOPING STORY.
 ALSO THE NEWEST ROUND OF
 POST NBC NEWS DEBATE POLLS
 SUGGEST THAT THAT SOME
 CANDIDATES MIGHT BE IN MORE
 TROUBLE WHEN IT COMES TO
 REACHING THE DEBATE STAGE.

 MOMENTS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK TO TWITTER TO SAY THAT HE
 WILL DEFY HIS OWN JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT AND THE COURTS ON THE
 CENSUS.
 THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT THE
 CENSUS WILL HAVE A CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION.
 NBC WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT
 KELLY O'DONNELL IS HERE TO TRY
 TO CLEAR THIS UP.
 HEY, KELLY, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 SAYS NO, PRESIDENT SAYS YES.
 WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S
 HAPPENING.
 Reporter: WELL, IT'S A LITTLE
 MORE COMPLICATED AND WHAT THIS
 REALLY GETS DOWN TO IS THE
 PRESIDENT DOES NOT LIKE THIS
 DECISION.
 AND THIS, OF COURSE, IS THE
 PRESIDENT WHO ARGUES FORCEFULLY
 THAT ASKING THOSE WHO REPLY TO
 THE 2020 CENSUS IF THEY ARE
 AMERICAN CITIZENS IS AN
 IMPORTANT PIECE OF DATA ALONG
 WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT A
 CENSUS COLLECTS.
 WHAT WE LEARNED LATE TUESDAY,
 YESTERDAY, WAS THAT THE
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE
 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WERE
 GOING FORWARD WITH PRINTING OF
 THE 2020 QUESTIONNAIRE WITHOUT
 THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION.
 NOW IS THERE SOME GRAY AREA
 HERE?
 YOU CAN KEEP A LEGAL CHALLENGE
 GOING WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS
 ARGUING FOR HERE.
 AND AT THE SAME TIME TAKE THE
 PRAGMATIC STEP OF PRINTING THE
 UP IN CENSUS AND DOING IT
 LAWFULLY WITHOUT THAT
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION NOW BECAUSE
 OF THE ENORMITY OF THE TASK OF
 DOING THE 2020 CENSUS.
 SO WHAT WE NEED SOME
 CLARIFICATION ON IS, IS THE
 PRESIDENT DIRECTLY DEFYING THIS
 PLAN TO PRINT OR IS HE ARGUING

 FOR CONTINUING THE LEGAL CASE?
 WHICH AT THE PUSHED IT BACK TO
 THE LOWER COURT SAYING THE
 REASONS GIFG GIVEN BISECT WILBUR
 ROSS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO
 ADDING THIS QUESTION AND IT WAS
 AN OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY FOR
 THE ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP
 LITIGATING.
 BUT THEY'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST A
 TIME DEADLINE, BECAUSE THE
 CONSTITUTION, NOT JUST ANY
 ORDINARY LAW, BUT THE
 CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT A
 CENSUS BE TAKEN EVERY TEN YEARS.
 SO WE'RE UP AGAINST THAT
 DEADLINE.
 IS IT PRAGMATISM MEETS POLITICS?
 IS IT A PRESIDENT THAT'S BEEN
 ACTIVE TON TWITTER TODAY PUSHING
 BACK?
 THIS DECISION BY THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT AND CONGRESS THAT WE
 LEARNED LATE YESTERDAY FOLLOWED
 WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE PRESIDENT
 ARGUING PRETTY FORCEFULLY THAT
 HE WANTED TO KEEP FIGHTING THIS.
 SO THE PRESIDENT HAS SORT OF
 BEEN PUSHED BACK ON HIS HEELS
 WITH THIS.
 HE'S CALLING IT FAKE NEWS.
 WE HAVE OFFICIALS IN BOTH
 DEPARTMENTS WHO TOLD US THE PLAN
 IS TO GO FORWARD WITH THE
 PRINTING.
 SO IS HE ADVOCATING FOR THE
 COURT CASE TO GO ON?
 IS THIS JUST SORT OF A POLITICAL
 MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT?
 TO OUR UNDERSTANDING, THE CENSUS
 QUESTION -- THE CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION IS NOT IN THE UP IN
 PRINTING THAT WILL BE ORDERED
 FAIRLY SHORTLY.
 CRAIG.
 KELLY O'DONNELL FROM THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 THANK YOU.
 I'M JOINED NOW BY SENIOR
 CORRESPONDENT FOR NPR BOSTON AND
 MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR KIMBERLY
 ATKINS.
 ALSO WITH ME, ASSISTANT
 PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT
 HARVARD UNIVERSITY.
 LEAH, THANK YOU LADIE, BOTH FOR
 BEING WITH ME.
 APPARENTLY THE PRINTER IS
 INSTRUCTED TO START THE PROCESS.
 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, LEAH?
 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT
 ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON HERE.
 FIRST, WE SEE AGAIN, THAT THE
 PRESIDENT IS COMPLETELY AT ODDS
 WITH OTHER FACTIONS OR OTHER
 AGENCIES OR DIVISIONS,
 DEPARTMENTS WITHIN HIS OWN
 ADMINISTRATION.
 SO IT RAISES THE QUESTION, YOU
 KNOW, WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?
 WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW?
 THE OTHER THING TOO THAT I THINK
 IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS
 THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
 ESSENTIALLY SAYING, AND THIS MAY
 BE SABER RAD RATTLING AND
 SHOWING A HARD POLITICAL MESSAGE
 THAT HE MEANS BUSINESS,TOR MAY
 BE SERIOUS.
 BUT HE'S SPECIALLY SAYING I'M
 GOING TO GO AGAINST THIS AND GO
 AGAINST THE COURT'S RULING AND
 MY OWN JUST DEPARTMENT AND I'M
 GOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT
 QUESTION FINDS ITS WAY ON THERE.
 SO HE'S PROMISING TO REALLY
 UPHOLD THE, YOU KNOW, THIS
 QUESTION ABOUT CITIZENSHIP AND
 CHANGE THE CENSUS.
 NOW, CAN HE DO THAT?
 IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR.
 HOW WOULD HE DO THAT.
 BUT HE'S ESSENTIALLY PROMISING
 DO THAT.
 AND THAT IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
 KIMBERLY, I THINK FOR FOLKS WHO
 ARE WATCHING AND WHO ARE
 LISTENING ON SIRIUS SATELLITE
 RADIO WHO PERHAPS HAVEN'T BEEN
 FOLLOWING THIS STORY AS CLOSELY,
 MAYBE WE SHOULD REMIND THEM WHY
 IS IT THAT THIS PRESIDENT FINDS
 THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ITSELF,
 WHY DOES HE WANT THIS TO BE A
 PART OF THIS CENSUS SO VERY
 BADLY?
 WELL, IT'S A COUPLE OF
 POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS,
 CRAIG.
 ONE IS THAT WHEN THE CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION IS ON THE CENSUS, THERE
 IS RESEARCH THAT WOULD SAY THAT
 IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK TO
 SUPPRESS PARTICIPATION IN THE
 CENSUS AND GET AN UNDERCOUNT
 PARTICULARLY NOT JUST OF PEOPLE
 WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS, BUT EVEN
 CITIZENS WHO ARE RELATED TO
 IMMIGRANTS HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE OF
 MIXED IMMIGRATION STATUS WITHIN
 THEIR HOUSEHOLD.
 THERE WILL BE A FEAR THAT

 PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS
 COULD GET THEM IN TROUBLE.
 WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT
 DOCUMENTATION AND THE LITIGATION
 OVER THE CENSUS THERE ARE SOME
 FOLKS WHO KNOW THAT THAT WOULD
 HURT DEMOCRATS IN AN ELECTION.
 I MEAN, THE CENSUS DECIDES A LOT
 OF THINGS FROM CONGRESSIONAL
 DISTRICTS TO FEDERAL FUNDING,
 BUT IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON
 THE ELECTION COULD A DEPRESSED
 TURNOUT AND DEPRESS THE STRENGTH
 OF THE DEMOCRATIC DISTRICTS.
 SO THERE'S A POLITICAL INCENTIVE
 HERE.
 I'VE TALKED TO STATE OFFICIALS
 WHO HAVE SAID EVEN WITH THE
 CENSUS QUESTION NOT ON THE
 CENSUS, THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH
 DISCUSSION, SO MANY DIVISIVENESS
 OVER THIS ISSUE THAT THEY ARE
 STILL FEARING THAT THERE WILL BE
 AN UNDERCOUNT.
 AND THAT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC FOR
 THE STATES WHO DEPEND ON THE
 CENSUS FOR THEIR FEDERAL
 FUNDING.
 ALSO IN THE NEWS TODAY, OF
 COURSE, THESE TROUBLING IMAGES
 THAT WE ARE GETTING THANKS TO
 THAT WATCHDOG GROUP OF THE
 MIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS FROM
 INSIDE THESE MIGRANT DETENTION
 CENTERS.
 I ASKED PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL JAY
 INSLEE JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO
 ABOUT HIS PLAN FOR IMMIGRATION.
 AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S STRATEGY ON
 IMMIGRATION.
 LEAH, KIMBERLY, THIS IS WHAT HE
 SAID.
 HE HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR
 THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE PEOPLE
 AFRAID AND HE LIKES THESE
 INHUMANE CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT
 IS PART OF HIS INTENTION TO FAN
 THE FLAME OF DISCORD AROUND
 IMMIGRATION.
 AND INSTEAD OF UNITING US TO
 FIND A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION,
 INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE
 ROOT CAUSES OF THIS IMMIGRATION
 PROBLEM, TO KEEP PEOPLE WHERE
 THEY LIVE AND NOT FORCE THEM TO
 COME NORTH, HE HAS DECIDED TO
 UTILIZE INHUMANE CONDITIONS AS A
 TOOL OF HIS GROSS CRUELTY.
 LEAH, IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING,
 IS IT THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY
 OR IS IT THE RESULT OF A FAILED
 STRATEGY?
 SO, YOU KNOW, THE ANSWER IS
 YES TO BOTH.
 I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
 HAS EMERGED OR THE PAST COUPLE
 YEARS IS THAT THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY,
 VERY DIRECT IN SOME WAYS, IN
 SOME WAYS NOT TO DIRECT, BUT HAS
 BEEN PRETTY DIRECT ABOUT SAYING
 THAT THEIR SEPARATION POLL VIS
 ARE THEIR POLICIES AROUND THE

 BORDER, THESE DETENTION CENTER
 POLICIES HAVE BEEN MADE TO
 DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM COME
 TOGETHER BORDER.
 AND IT'S NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
 AND WE'VE SEEN AN EXPLOSION IN
 THE TREATMENT, THESE CENTERS,
 AND THEN KIND OF POOR
 CONDITIONS.
 WE'VE SEEN THE ADMINISTRATION
 ARGUING IN FAVOR OF POOR
 CONDITIONS.
 NOW, THE BIGGER THING I THINK,
 AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A
 QUESTION FOR MOST DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES MOVING INTO -- INTO
 PRIMARY DEBATES AND INTO THE
 GENERAL ELECTION IS WELL, WHAT
 ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO FIX
 IT?
 WHAT IS THE POLICY ON
 IMMIGRATION, ASYLUM SEEKERS, AND
 REFUGEE CENTERS, AND THEN THE
 CONDITIONS THESE PEOPLE ARE
 FACING.
 BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S
 UNSUSTAINABLE.
 AS A POLITICAL STRATEGY PERHAPS
 IT'S WORKING FOR PRESIDENT
 TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS, BUT FOR THE
 REST OF THE COUNTRY IT
 ABSOLUTELY IS NOT WORKING.
 KIMBERLY, LET'S TALK POLITICS
 FOR JUST A SECOND HERE.
 AND THEN MAYOR PETE
 SPECIFICALLY.
 WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HIS
 FUNDRAISING NUMBERS DURING OUR
 LAST SEGMENT.
 BERNIE SANDERS AS WELL PUT UP
 ABOUT 24 MILLION.
 ACTUALLY BERNIE SANDERS
 TRANSFERRED ABOUT 6 MILLION, HE
 RAISED ROUGHLY 18.
 BUT MAYOR PETE RAISED CLOSE TO
 $25 MILLION.
 THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE FOR A
 SECOND QUARTER.
 BUT --
 YEAH.
 YOU LOOK AT HIS POLLING AND
 THE TWO DON'T SEEM TO MAKE
 SENSE.
 WHY -- WHY IS HE NOT POLLING
 BETTER IF HE IS RAISING SO MUCH
 MONEY?
 WELL, A FEW REASONS.
 I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO
 ARE RAISING MONEY FOR MAYOR PETE
 AS HE TRAVELS TO PLACES,
 INCLUDING MASSACHUSETTS THIS
 UPCOMING WEEKEND.
 AND THEY SAY THAT ON THE GROUND
 HE IS RESONATING WITH FOLKS.
 THEY'RE DOING A COMBINATION OF
 THESE BIG-DOLLAR FUNDRAISERS
 THAT FOLKS LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN
 AND BERNIE SANDERS HAVE CHOSEN
 NOT TO DO.
 BUT ALSO DOING THE
 SMALLER-DOLLAR DONATIONS IN
 ORDER TO ENERGIZE YOUNGER
 PEOPLE, REALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO
 GET TO KNOW HIM.
 AND IT HAS BEEN LITERALLY PAYING
 OFF.
 NOW ONE THING THAT RAISING THIS
 MONEY WILL DO WILL ALLOW HIM TO
 STAY IN THE RACE LONGER THAN
 SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES AND
 GIVE HIM MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY
 TO BUILD HIS PROFILE, GET OUT
 WITH ADS, AND RAISE HIS PROFILE.
 I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST
 DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS OR WHAT
 HE'S ABOUT YET.
 AND THAT COULD HAPPEN.
 BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S HAD
 A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME
 RESONATING WITH VOTERS OF COLOR.
 WE KNOW THAT FOR DEMOCRATS THAT
 SAY CRUCIAL, CRUCIAL BLOCK.
 HE HAD THE ISSUE WITH THE POLICE
 SHOOTING.
 YEAH.
 IN SOUTH BEND.
 AND SO THAT IS A BIG -- THAT'S A
 BIG OBSTACLE THAT HE'S GOING TO
 HAVE TO OVERCOME.
 BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW HE HAS THE
 FUNDS TO STAY IN IT.
 KIMBERLY ATKINS, LEAH, ENJOY
 THE HOLIDAY, LADIES.
 THANK YOU OR YOUR TIME.
 THANK YOU.
>ESE HE'S BEEN EXTREMELY VOCAL
 ABOUT WINNING BACK THOSE VOTERS
 THAT SWUNG TO TRUMP.

  I have one kid in each branch         of the military,

     It's so important to us           that Verizon
 is supporting military families.
  When I have a child deployed,
    having a reliable network        means everything.
   So, when I get a video chat,
   and I get to see their face,
       it's the best thing          in the world.
    And I've earned every one       of these gray hairs.
   Military moms, we serve too.
 The network more people rely on,         gives you more.
     Like military plans with  a special price on Unlimited,
  $100 per line, and big savings
        on our best phones         when you switch.
         That's Verizon.
     Think all premium fuels          are the same?
 New Shell V-Power NiTRO+ Premium     Gasoline is engineered
   with four levels of defense             against
    gunk, wear, corrosion and            friction.
   That helps keep your engine        running like new.
  So, maybe it's time to unthink         what you think
  you think about premium fuel.
   Shell V-Power NiTRO+ Premium           Gasoline...
     It's Fuel For Thought.
 MAKING THE OVERCROWDED AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS REVEALED IN
 THESE MIGRANT DETENTION
 FACILITIES A NATIONAL FOCAL
 POINT.
 I'M JOINED NOW BY OHIO
 DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN AND
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TIM RYAN.
 CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE ALL SEEN
 THESE PICTURES NOW AND WE'VE
 HEARD SOME OF THE HEARTBREAKING
 STORIES OF THE MIGRANTS FROM THE
 DETENTION FACILITIES.
 A NUMBER OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES
 HAVE VISITED AND RELEASED SOME
 DETAILED PLANS ON HOW TO DEAL
 WITH THEM.
 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE
 EITHER JUST YET.
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THESE
 DETENTION FACILITIES,
 SPECIFICALLY FACILITIES THAT ARE
 PRIVATELY OPERATED?
 GO AHEAD.
 YEAH, WE SHOULD NOT BE
 LOCKING THESE PEOPLE UP IN THE
 WAY WE'RE DOING IT.
 CRAIG, IT'S ATROCIOUS.
 I THINK IT GOES AGAINST OUR
 VALUES.
 I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE --
 I WISH THE PRESIDENT WOULD ASK
 DOCTORS AND NURSES TO GO
 IMMEDIATELY TO THE BORDER AND
 START HELPING ADMINISTER SOME
 CARE TO THESE PEOPLE.
 JAMMING THEM IN THESE
 FACILITIES, I MEAN THIS IS
 STUNNING TO THINK THAT THIS IS
 THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
 AND IT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE
 LEVEL OF ANXIETY THAT WE HAVE
 ACROSS OUR SOCIETY TODAY, CRAIG.
 I MEAN, EVERYONE IS TELLING US
 THINGS ARE GOING REALLY GOOD,
 BUT YET EVERYBODY FEELS REALLY
 BAD.
 AND THIS ANXIETY, JUST WATCHING
 THESE THINGS HAPPEN, LET ALONE
 IF YOU'RE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
 TO THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOWN
 THERE IS JUST HEARTBREAKING.
 AND WE'RE THE UNITED STATES.
 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO DOWN
 THERE AND FIX THIS AND IT
 SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT LONG.
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON DAY ONE,
 IF ELECTED, ABOUT THIS
 SPECIFICALLY?
 WELL, MAKE SURE EVERYBODY
 COMING IN THROUGH THESE
 FACILITIES IS TAKEN CARE OF.
 BUT THE KEY IS GOING TO BE TO GO
 TO CENTRAL AMERICA AND ACTUALLY
 STABILIZE THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE
 PEOPLE ARE MIGRATING FROM.
 THE PRESIDENT IS THE DISTRACTER
 IN CHIEF.
 HE CAN'T FOCUS FOR MORE THAN
 FIVE SECONDS.
 THE ISSUE IS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
 I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS NOW FOR
 MONTHS.
 WE NEED TO GO TO CENTRAL
 AMERICA, STABILIZE THOSE
 COUNTRIES.
 KICK THE GANGS OUT.
 WE DON'T EVEN HAVE AN AMBASSADOR
 IN HONDURAS RIGHT NOW.
 THE PRESIDENT IS CUTTING THE
 STATE DEPARTMENT FUNDING THAT
 WOULD HELP US REPAIR WHAT IS
 HAPPENING DOWN THERE.
 THAT'S THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM.
 THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING
 FROM.
 AND IF WE WANT TO END THE CRISIS
 AT THE BORDER, WE NEED TO GO
 DEAL WITH THE HEART OF THE
 MATTER.
 THE CANDIDATES OVER THE
 HOLIDAY WEEKEND HERE, YOU ARE IN
 IOWA.
 YOU'RE IN IOWA RIGHT NOW.
 WOULD LOO.
 THERE'S A NEW POLL OF IOWA
 VOTERS FROM AFTER NBC'S DEBATE
 LAST WEEK.
 THE THE POLL IS JUST OUT.
 THREE OF THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED
 IN THE DEBATES, NEW YORK MAYOR
 BILL de BLASIO, OHIO
 REPRESENTATIVE TIM RYAN AND
 CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE ERIC
 SWALWELL FAILED TO ATTRACT A
 SINGER SUPPORTER.
 THAT'S OF 500 PEOPLE IN IOWA WHO
 WERE SURVEYED, CONGRESSMAN.
 DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO
 STAY IN THIS RACE?
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
 I MEAN, LITERALLY OUR PHONE HAS
 BEEN RINGING OFF THE HOOK SINCE
 THE DEBATE.
 WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
 WE'RE LEANING TO VICE PRESIDENT
 BIDEN WHO ARE CALLING US AND
 THEY WANT TO MEET.
 WE'VE HAD SOME OF THE BEST
 FUNDRAISING DAYS WE'VE HAD SINCE
 THE DEBATE.
 SO I THINK WE CONNECTED.
 CLEARLY THE NATIONAL
 CONVERSATION WAS AROUND
 SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I THINK
 THESE POLLS AT THIS POINT ARE
 ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS.
 YOU CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT
 WINNERS FROM THE LAST 40 YEARS
 AND AT SOME POINT THEY WERE
 WHERE I AM NOW.
 AND I THINK WE'VE GOT THE
 MESSAGE.
 WE'RE CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE
 AROUND THE STRESS AND ANXIETY
 AND FEAR THAT'S FACING THEM.
 WHETHER IT'S THE ECONOMIC
 ANXIETY, WHETHER IT'S AROUND
 HEALTH CARE, WHETHER IT'S AROUND
 WHAT WE'RE WATCHING HAPPEN AT
 THE BORDER, WHETHER IT'S WHAT'S
 HAPPENING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND
 OUR SOIL AND THE THINGS THAT ARE
 HAPPENING ENVIRONMENTALLY.
 WE'RE CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE,
 CRAIG, AND PEOPLE ARE -- YOU
 KNOW, I'M ASKING PEOPLE TO COME
 TO TIM RYAN FOR AMERICA.COM, BE
 A PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN.
 WE JUST RELEASED THE MOST
 COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AGENDA
 TO HELP WITH TRAUMA-BASED CARE
 FOR OUR KIDS AND SOCIAL AND
 EMOTIONAL LEARNING IN OUR
 SCHOOLS AND WRAP-AROUND THERAPY.
 SO WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THE BIG
 ISSUES IN MY CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S
 WHY PEOPLE ARE GETTING ON BOARD.
 YOU JUST MENTIONED
 FUNDRAISING.
 HOW MUCH HAVE YOU RAISED IN THE
 SECOND QUARTER?
 WELL, WE DON'T HAVE -- I
 DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS RIGHT
 NOW, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT
 OUR BEST DAYS WERE RIGHT AFTER
 THE DEBATE.
 AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
 THAT AND WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL
 INTO JULY.
 SO WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT
 DIRECTION.
 $24 MILLION?
 WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT
 DIRECTION.
 I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH IT.
 MAYOR PETE HAS ABOUT $25
 MILLION.
 BERNIE SANDERS PUT OUT HIS
 NUMBERS YESTERDAY AT $24
 MILLION.
 ARE WE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?
 WE ARE NOT IN THAT
 NEIGHBORHOOD.
 I MEAN, HERE'S THE DEAL, CRAIG.
 I'M FROM NORTHEAST OHIO.
 I'M NOT FROM A BIG CITY.
 I'M NOT FROM A BIG STATE.
 I DON'T HAVE AN IVY LEAGUE
 EDUCATION OR NETWORK THAT I CAN
 TAP INTO.
 SO WE'RE, YOU KNOW, DOING IT THE
 WAY IT HAS TO BE DONE AND THAT'S
 GRASS ROOTS, BUILDING THIS BRING
 BRICK BY BRICK.
 WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT
 DIRECTION.
 WE JUST STARTED A WHOLE TEACHERS
 FOR TIM INITIATIVE AROUND
 TEACHERS WHO ARE COMING ON
 BOARD.
 WE'RE BUILDING THIS THING OUT.
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IT'S
 JULY.
 BILL CLINTON DIDN'T GET IN THIS
 RACE UNTIL OCTOBER.
 SO WE ARE WAY AHEAD OF THE GAME
 HERE COMPARED TO PAST YEARS.
 CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU.
 AND ENJOY THE 4th.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 AHEAD IN THE NEXT HOUR, MY
 COLLEAGUE ANDREA MITCHELL IS
 GOING TO HAVE MORE ON THE
 CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE
 PRESIDENT'S PLANNED 4th OF JULY
 EVENT.
 Budget meeting!                           Sweet.
   If you compare last quarter        to this quarter...          Various: Mmm.
    <i> It's no wonder everything</i>    <i> seems a little better</i>
      <i> with the creamy taste</i>           <i> of Philly,</i>
      <i> made with fresh milk</i>         <i> and real cream.</i>
 When you book at Hilton.com, you  get the Price Match Guarantee.
        So if you find your      <i> </i>room at a lower rate,           <i> of Philly,</i>
         Hilton is like...
    We're gonna match that rate  and give you an extra 25% off.
   What would travel sites do if   you found a different price?
      That's not my problem,        it's your problem.
