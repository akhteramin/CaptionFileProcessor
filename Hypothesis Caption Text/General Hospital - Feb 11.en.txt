[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Woman: Jason Morgan? You're Jason Morgan, right? Hi, I'm Harmony. Welcome to Beechers Corners. Thank you. Is this your first visit? No. Oh. Well, since you called with questions about Dawn of Day, I suspect you want to know what's up with us, right? Check us out? So, let's get to it. Thank you for meeting me. Yeah, of course. Thanks for the...invite. [ Sighs ] Although I think I know why you invited me here. Yes. Jason told me about the breakup, and I just wanted to offer my support to both of you. Which means you want to talk me out of breaking up with him. [ Laughs ] -Hey. -Hey. Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say hi. Drew. Hi. Hi. Hi, yourself. Josslyn told me the good news about Oscar... What? What? There's good news about Oscar? Yeah, uh, the -
- the -
- the tumor hasn't grown, so it buys him more time. What? That is -
- That's incredible. Anyway, uh, his mom and I, we're trying to get back to normal life. [ Chuckles ] Whatever that is. So, I finally have time to check in on Hank or Shiloh -
- Shi-S-Shiloh. No, don't -
- don't even worry about it. I got -
- Well, hold on. If -
- If Drew has the time... I mean, the more information, the better, right? Exactly. And I want to help, so... He made a point to be friendly, so the least I could do is be friendly back. -Hey. I-It was -
- -Yeah. It was good to see you, and -
- and I'm -
- I'm really happy to hear about Oscar. Yeah. Me, too. Thanks. Hey. Let's hope we get lucky and Drew gets leverage on Shiloh, and then you and Jason won't have to break up after all. You're Dr. Neil Byrne. And you're Alexis Davis. Yep. Says it right here. Dr. Neil Byrne. Psychiatrist. Gee, I wish I had read this before I pocketed it. I wish I had known I was inviting a patient to dinner. So what do we do now? Well, that's up to you. [ Dramatic music plays ] Do you see a spot for Kiki's memorial brick? Yeah, near the, uh -
- the flower bed down there. She'd like that... If you have postmenopausal osteoporosis and a high risk for fracture now might not be the best time to ask yourself are my bones strong? Life is full of make-or-break moments. That's why it's so important to help reduce your risk of fracture with Prolia®. Only Prolia® is proven to help strengthen and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months. Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant, are allergic to it, or take XGEVA®. Serious allergic reactions, like low blood pressure; trouble breathing; throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling; rash; itching; or hives have happened. Tell your doctor about dental problems as severe jaw bone problems may happen or new or unusual pain in your hip groin, or thigh, as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred. Speak to your doctor before stopping Prolia® as spine and other bone fractures have occurred. Prolia® can cause serious side effects, like low blood calcium, serious infections, which could need hospitalization, skin problems, and severe bone, joint, or muscle pain. Are you ready? Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones. In our family we love tiny things. We save every drop of rain, study every bite of frost.

It's a very thoughtful gesture... I didn't see you there -
- [ Door opens ] Griffin? Come away from there, would you? You're -
- You're too close to the edge. You have some kind of death wish? Wouldn't want you to lose your balance. What brings you here? Looking for Griffin? No, I'm looking for you. I know what you've been up to. We can do whatever you feel is best... Uh, I'm happy to give you a referral. Well, I can't very well go back to Dr. Collins because I'm representing his wife in his divorce... And there, I did it again. I offered way too much information. You're talking to a therapist. There's no such thing. But I-I can tell you're uncomfortable. So, I am going to give you the name of an associate who may... [ Paper tears ] ...be a good fit. And -
- And I hope it works out between you and Dr. Sautner. Thank you. Uh, good night. [ Sighs ] [ Sighing ] Oh, God. That's a nice surprise. Well, you know, I had a free night. I thought maybe we could, uh, reconnect... That's great, man. Thanks, uh -
- Thanks for calling. After you. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. -[ Sighs ] You know, I, uh... [ Door closes ] ...really wanted to, uh, you know, talk about our time in Afghanistan together. I guess that's back when you went by Hank, right? [ Chuckles ] Well, it's, uh... it's true. You, uh -
- You saved my life. But, uh -
- But it was more than that, man. We, uh -
- We were seriously tight. Although, you, uh -
- you held your cards a little closer to the vest than I did. You sure as hell held your liquor better. There was, uh, no drunken, sloppy, late-night confessions from you. Take it there were from you? Well, you know, just things that I had to get off my chest. In case I didn't make it back that day, you know? Yeah, well, that's understandable. [ Chuckles ] I mean, you always said that you didn't remember, but, uh... I think you were doing that just to make me feel better. Must have been... some confessions. How are Danny and Scout? Scout -
- she is gonna be two... Oh, my gosh. ...in like two weeks. [ Laughs ] And Danny, he's just the sweetest, most thoughtful little boy in the whole entire world. Mm. I actually told him I was coming here to see you and Sonny, and -
- I'm sorry, I don't have a purse, it's in my pocket -
- but he, um, wanted me to give you this. Oh! [ Laughs ] Isn't it cute? Oh, my goodness. It's so adorable. [ Gasps ] Wow. Little boys can surprise you, can't they? Um... I mean, I would never associate Danny with crafts and cards. I mean, that boy, he's such a little adventure guy. [ Chuckling ] Oh, tell me about it. He's, like, running and jumping and everything. I know. I know. I just had to have Monica lock the attic because he was bringing Annabelle the Second up to the attic and they were playing on the roof. Who does that sound like, huh? Just like his father. I mean, just fearless enough to where you want to rip your hair out, but... just sweet and thoughtful all at the same time. You're gonna have to work a little harder to hide how much you love Jason if you want to sell this whole breakup thing. But before I answer <i> your</i> questions, do you mind answering one of<i> mine?</i> Uh, depends on the question. You're here on someone's behalf. Who? A family member? I consider her one, yes. In Beechers Corners? Is it someone I know? No. Well, then, why come here? Why not just talk to Shiloh? He's in Port Charles. Because I wanted to talk to someone besides... Hank Archer. [ Laughs ] Now that's a blast from the past. [ Chuckles ] I used to be called Lorraine. Yeah, me, a Lorraine. My parents chose it, obviously, but it was never a good fit. I found it so freeing and empowering to be able to choose my own name. So, you became Harmony. Like Hank became Shiloh. Well, choosing my own name was a-a bridge to becoming my true self. Shiloh. [ Chuckles ] He untethered me from what was holding me back, and Dawn of Day opened my mind and my heart to my own potential. Did you notice that community center across the street? Shiloh and I built it from the ground up. Are you still in touch with, uh -
- with Shiloh? Yeah, well...of course. We still conduct business together, if that's what you mean. But you're not together. I mean, you're here. Shiloh's in Port Charles. Why? MOVING?

What is it you think I'm up to? Oh, come on, Kevin. It's why you're up here, isn't it? I went to your office, looking for you. I found this on your desk. You've arranged for a commemorative brick in Kiki's honor. The letter says that the best way to choose a spot is to look down from the roof, so I-I came up here to see for myself, give you my input... It's a lovely gesture, Kevin. Thank you. It's all I could think of. Just have something of Kiki here at the hospital, and maybe bring some small comfort to the people who miss her. I was just saying the same thing. Let me know when, uh, you guys pick the final spot. I'm sorry. I, uh... I have somewhere I need to be. Now Kiki will be a part of the place that she loved forever. I admit, a brick isn't much, but if it dissipates your anger towards me, then I'm doubly glad I thought of it. I'm not angry, Kevin. I jumped to conclusions. I owe you an apology. See, in order to find out more about Shiloh, I have to make myself seem really vulnerable. Okay, but this guy obviously has charisma, and he knows how to use it... Do you think he's a sexual predator? Well, I intend to find out. Not only for Kristina's sake, but every other girl that's living under that roof. That's why I have to see this through. Okay. But to do that, you have to con him, right? Do you think you can? Trust me. Shiloh's about to get a taste of his own medicine. I was one of Shiloh's earliest supporters. He was the visionary, and I was the pragmatist to help make it work. So, why are you guys apart? That's simple -
- he wants to expand the work that we do. Okay, so why Port Charles? Well, the city suffered a bad earthquake a while back, and Shiloh found people in Port Charles who needed the kind of outreach that Dawn of Day could provide. So, he left, and I stayed behind to continue the work that we do here. Yeah, he seems, uh, pretty devoted to his work. What about a life outside of it? Shiloh's life is his work. Oh, so no -
- no family? No -
- No interest in -
- in having a family? [ Chuckles ] Dawn of Day is a family. Why do you ask? Well, because [sighs] the young lady I'm here for, I mean, she's really involved with Dawn of Day, but she's -
- you know, she's a little naive, and she's growing attached to Shiloh as more than a mentor. I'm s-
- What are you implying? She's falling for him. So, h-how does he -
- how does he handle situations like this when they come up? Yeah, well, that's the, uh -
- the thing about confessions. When you're in the middle of making them, they seem of monumental importance. But, uh, when you're looking at them in the grand scheme of life, well, they're not important at all, are they? I guess you got a point, but, uh, you know, why are you still thinking about them? I don't know. I mean, I guess coming back to Port Charles, it just, you know, brought it all back, you know? First, I run into a brother that I didn't even know you have with<i> your</i> face. Yeah. Right? And then I-I see you again with -
- with -
- with a-another face, and -
- and you don't know me from Adam, you know, so... Well, I don't remember anyone or anything, so, uh, don't take it personally. Not at all. So, is there any chance your memories will return? -We're doing karaoke later, and you're gonna sing. -Jamie, this is your house? -I know, it's not much, but it's home. Right, kids? -Kids? -Papa, Papa! -[ Laughs ] -You didn't tell me your friends were coming. -Oh, yeah. -This one is tiny like a child. -Yeah, she is. Oh, but seriously, it's good to be surrounded by what matters most -
- a home and auto bundle from Progressive. -Oh, sweetie, please, play for us. -Oh, no, I couldn't. -Please. -Okay.

Mind if I come in? Uh, sure. I was in town visiting Nina and thought I'd stop by. I hope that's all right. Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Uh... It's been a while. Not since Kiki's funeral... [Music] Keep your feet from coming off the ground [Music] I can't imagine what you've been going through. [Music] Live each moment [Music] It must be so hard walking past Kiki's apartment every day... How are you doing? [Music] Take it in before it turns to memory [Music] Want to know how I'm doing? I'm sick and tired of everybody talking to me about Kiki. Talking isn't gonna bring her back. [Music] Don't get lost and lose the here [Music] Once I calmed down, I realized -
- that you weren't protecting Franco. You didn't notify the police because you knew he wasn't a threat, and if you thought he was, you definitely would've warned us. I never believed Franco would harm anyone. Especially not your beautiful daughter... Even with his dark side, I never thought he would act on those impulses. I know. I spoke with him. I'm convinced he's innocent. That means the killer is still free. That<i> is</i> a real problem. Doesn't have to be. You need to go to the police, Kevin. You need to tell them that they have the wrong man. [ Knock on door ] Come in. You know, I've thought about it, and I thought, You know what? I've already spilled my guts to you. And -
- And since I'm perfectly at ease talking to a complete stranger, which I have no explanation for, it makes sense that I would be comfortable speaking to you here. So, if you're still willing to treat me... I am. And based on our previous discussion, you have some intriguing issues to work out. Uh...referring back to our conversation, I-I just have to ask, just to be sure... When we met at Charlie's, did you know that I was your patient? So, supposedly, there's a procedure that could, um [inhales deeply] possibly undo what had been done to me. Well, forgive me, I-I-I don't know what happened to you. Long story. Heard plenty of long stories, brother. [ Laughs ] Yeah, not like this, I can assure you. You know how, um... you said you were surprised to hear that I went AWOL? Yeah. Well, that wasn't the case. I was abducted. I knew it. I knew it. I knew you would never abandon your post. That's what happened to you... Well, the plan was to, uh... put me in my brother's place to, uh... transfer his knowledge, his memories into my head, and then he could be eliminated. Yeah, but he's still around, so... someone messed up. First part worked. I got his memories, and, uh, well, I lost my own. Now, you said that there was some procedure that could help you recover your memories. Now, why -
- why -
- why wouldn't you do that? What -
- What could be holding you back? Maybe Sonny could<i> persuade</i> Shiloh to leave town? No, no, no, no, no. No, that could backfire. Shiloh could tell Kristina. Kristina -
- she could dig in so much harder. No way. All right. Oh, I hate this. I hate this for everyone. You and Jason just got back together. I'd like to wring Shiloh's enlightened neck. I've got to pretend to hang on to his every word. God. Yeah. What if he catches on that you're playing him? Well, I've -
- I-I-I have thought about this, and I've got a few things going for me. One: I am an experienced con. Two: Shiloh expects women to fall for him, including Kristina. I mean, and all these other girls, they're almost like his groupies, and he assumes he can pull me in. All I have to do is play along. Shiloh is naturally warm and inclusive, and that can be misunderstood by some of our more... vulnerable volunteers. So, what does Shiloh do about that? He handles it. He handles it? I-I mean, like I said, my friend's vulnerable and -
- and naive. I just -
- I don't -
- I don't want her to get hurt, so, I mean, what d-
- how does he handle -
- Cop Billy: Jason Morgan? Yeah. Um... is there -
- is there a problem? Ran your plates. Seems you have an arrest record here in Beechers Corners. For murder. Yeah, those -
- those charges were dropped. Yes, I know, but you're on the wrong side of the law again. <i> Dove Intensive Repair</i> <i> conditioner proves it can.</i> <i> We treat one brush</i> <i> with Dove conditioner...</i> <i> ...and expose both</i> <i> to heat styling, ...</i> <i> ...to bleaching...</i> <i> ...and even coloring.</i> <i> The difference is clear.</i> <i> The brush treated with Dove</i> <i> is visibly smoother....</i> <i>...and protected against damage.</i> <i> Dove Intensive Repair</i> <i> conditioner.</i> <i> For 100% touchably</i> <i> beautiful hair.</i> <i> Since one conditioner</i> <i> doesn't fit all.</i> <i> Dove Ultra-Care Conditioners.</i> [Music] They say quit they say done [Music] [Music] They say we're too grown for fun [Music] [Music] They say old, we say young [Music] [Music] We say playful's never done [Music] [Music] Don't fight the feeling just let it flow [Music] [Music] Stack it up, rack it up, let it go [Music] [Music] Laughter is calling pick up the phone [Music] [Music] Let's stay playful, Oreo [Music] Hello?

At which time, I was already sitting down at Charlie's with my book and my coffee. So, no -
- I didn't know that the interesting woman sitting down next to me -
- and who I asked to dinner -
- was Alexis Davis, my soon-to-be patient. And if I did, I would never have asked you to dinner. I apologize for questioning your professionalism. Apology accepted. But, you know, if we move forward... can you trust me? Now, see, there's a lot to unpack in that question. Hmm. I can try. Well, why don't we, um, see how today goes, and if you choose to, we can continue? Okay. You were, uh, prompted to call me this afternoon, and I'm just wondering why it was so urgent to return to therapy at this point. Oh, well, there are a lot of reasons. Chief among them i-is the feeling I had when I saw my ex-husband kissing his girlfriend, his new girlfriend. And then there was yesterday, I had this experience at this organization called Dawn of Day. So, as I understand it, uh... the procedure is a lot like overwriting a computer program. Yeah. My old memories will be restored -
- but all the memories I've made in the past five years would essentially be eliminated, deleted. You know... The relationships I've made, people I've grown to love, memories of my daughter, Scout. From the day she was born up until now, gone. Hmm. I didn't even know I had a son until I moved to Port Charles, so meeting him, the memories we've made together... I'd lose them. They mean everything to me. So... The short answer is no. I will not be having the procedure. That's good. That's good, man. You got your priorities straight. [ Chuckles ] You know the worst part of this whole thing is having to lie to Danny. I know, he's just too young to understand everything that's going on, and I know he's gonna be missing out on some major family time. Can't you guys meet up at the Quartermaines? Well, yeah, I'm -
- I'm counting on it. Monica's been pretty great about that. She's the ultimate hands-off mother-in-law. Monica? Yeah. A-Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, my gosh, when I was married to A.J., all she did was meddle. I mean, I guess I understand, because A.J. and I loathed each other, but... Anyway, I'm just saying, you guys have a totally different relationship than I had. You know, it's -
- it's really funny. For two people that can't stand each other, you two are a lot alike... In what universe? You both have a love for family. Well, you're a part of that club, too, Sam. I mean, look at everything you're doing to protect Kristina. Yeah, but I also know what it's like to have a guy use you and make you feel worthless and tear down your self-esteem. And I am not gonna let Shiloh do that to Kristina. Officer, I've done nothing wrong. I'm just trying to sit here and have a conversation... Could there be some kind of mistake? No mistake. Mr. Morgan's vehicle is parked too close to a designated handicapped spot. Th-There was no -
- There was no sign. They're difficult to see, even in the daylight. I need you to move it now, or I'll have it impounded. It's okay, Billy. Billy. Mr. Morgan will move his car shortly. Okay? We're just wrapping things up here. But thank you for your diligence. [ Sighs ] Sure thing, Harmony. Okay. I'm sorry. His bark is worse than his bite. Yeah, well, thank you for smoothing that over. Yeah. It's wonderful how this community looks out for each other. It's really come together since Dawn of Day launched here. I hope we can bring that same sort of fellowship to Port Charles. Is there anything else you'd like to know? I think I've heard enough. I hope I've calmed your anxieties on behalf of your...person. Do you feel more comfortable about Dawn of Day now? I've learned a lot. Look, I-I-I'm sorry. Really, I-I-I don't know what came over me. It's just... Look, I don't know what's worse -
- thinking about Kiki, or -
- or -
- or not thinking about her. I-I'm consumed with missing her. I-I can't seem to find a moment's peace. So, how did you get those bruises? I noticed them when I came in. Did you get mugged or something? Uh...boxing. I-I spar sometimes. With those neurosurgeon hands? Are you crazy? No, we, uh -
- we wear gloves. You know, big -
- big, padded ones. Okay, well, pick someone your own size next time. [ Chuckles ] Looks like you were boxing a kangaroo. No, I just, uh... I just lost focus, that's all. I... My mind wanders, and, uh, regret just takes over. I know the feeling. What do you have to regret? It's important that the police stop wasting their time on Franco -
- and -
- and find the monster who killed Kiki. I know you're struggling with terrible grief, and I didn't want to add to it by upsetting you... You didn't. It's -
- It isn't your fault that I overreacted. But you ran right back to Griffin. [ Chuckles ] What? Oh, you saw Griffin comforting me and you assumed that I went<i> back</i> to him? Ava, you ran out on me. And you're so beautiful, and... Come on. Let's face it -
- the man's an Adonis, and... Naturally, I just thought that -
- You -
- You're insane. You know that? And I'd have to be equally insane to go back to the man who betrayed me with my own daughter. Kevin... [ Chuckling ] Oh, Kevin.

When I found out I had Age-related Macular Degeneration, AMD, I wanted to fight back. My doctor and I came up with a plan. It includes PreserVision. <i> Only PreserVision</i> <i> AREDS 2</i> <i> has the exact</i> <i> nutrient formula</i> <i> recommended by the</i> <i> National Eye Institute</i> <i> to help reduce the risk</i> <i> of progression of moderate</i> <i> to advanced AMD.</i> That's why I fight.

So I was excited about All-New Colgate Total. Its breakthrough formula does more... Wonderful. Sensitivity, strengthens teeth... It kills germs through my whole mouth.. I like your confidence. Thanks Mr. Lee! Now there's no such thing as too close. Yes, there is. No, there's not. Yes there is. No, there's not! Okay. <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i> <i> Do more for your whole mouth.</i> [ Sighs ] I-I came to Port Charles with zero expectations. I was gonna blow in, meet my biological mother, and blow out. And then I met Nina, and Kiki, and Charlotte, and all these people that I came to care about. And I found myself worrying about you all, hoping that you were all okay. That's good. [ Chuckles ] That's -
- That's a good thing. You made -
- You made connections. I just want to do the right thing, but I'm not sure how. There are things that are [exhales sharply] hard to fix. You want to talk about it? I'm, uh -
- I'm open, wide-open to distractions, um... And I-I really want to help. Thanks. [ Chuckles ] Why is it so hot in here? It's the building. You can't -
- You can't control the radiator. Kiki showed me a few tricks, but I never really got the hang of it. You know, she had the -
- the magic touch... ...with everything she did. [ Sighs ] Are you okay? I really thought I had lost you. [ Exhales sharply ] You know... it's only been a short time, Ava, but... you have my heart. [ Chuckles ] You're everything to me. I don't think I'd be able to go on putting one foot in front of the other if I -
- if I'd lost the woman I love. You... You love me? In an effort to try to heal this rift between my daughter and me, I agreed to attend a seminar led by this man that she respects. And how was it? Weird. Completely uncomfortable, but I played nicely in order to appease my daughter, and in that, I ended up admitting that I have this yearning to have the same feeling that I had when I was with my ex. And as you astutely put it, y-you said that I tend to frame everything in -
- in the context of my ex, and I-I-I don't want to do that anymore. Um... I'm, uh, fairly certain that I don't want a relationship with him again. However, his type, that type is the type that I am, uh, drawn to. So, you have a type? Oh, I do. I do, yes. Um... Um, Dangerous. Selfish. Incapable of intimacy and honesty, and... someone who loves power more than they will ever love me. Is there a man in your life who, uh, set this pattern up for you? My father. You know, it's a small world, because he's one of those exiled Russian aristocrats that you're so fond of studying. Hmm. Shiloh: That is a lot of pain that you're carrying around, man. And if you ever just want to reconcile what happened to you or -
- or just vent... my seminars have helped ease a lot of suffering. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Including your own? Well, they're a result of my own breakthroughs, you know? Hmm. I've learned to untie from my troubled past. And now that I know that it's no longer burdening you, either, well, looks like we both could have a little closure. Tell you what. No charge. [ Chuckles ] Hell, maybe I should start my own seminars. Looks like you've given me my life back yet again. Thank you. Okay. All right. Thanks for coming by, man. It was good seeing you. Thanks for having me. Anytime. I'd invite you to attend an open house here or in Port Charles, but something tells me that'll never happen. You know, I really wish you'd open your mind and accept help. You must bear scars being arrested for a murder that you didn't commit. No. I don't. Thank you for your time. Okay, I-I know that you and Jason aren't candy-hearts-and-flowers kind of people, but you should be together on Valentine's Day. I have plans on Valentine's Day. You're going to that event at Dawn of Day, aren't you? I've seen the fliers -
- True Love Begins with Self Love. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Shiloh's expecting me. Ugh, well, you can have an emergency. You know, a tire could blow, anything. Oh, God. No, no, no, no. That is very tempting. Don't do that. I will not be spending Valentine's Day with the man that I love. I will be at the Dawn of Day house, soaking up all of Shiloh's... wisdom with an eager smile on my face. Because the harder I sell this... the faster I can get Kristina out of there.

With Neulasta Onpro patients get their day back... to be with family, or just to sleep in. Strong chemo can put you at risk of serious infection. In a key study Neulasta reduced the risk of infection from 17% to 1%, a 94% decrease. Neulasta Onpro is designed to deliver Neulasta the day after chemo and is used by most patients today. Neulasta is for certain cancer patients receiving strong chemotherapy. Do not take Neulasta if you're allergic to it or Neupogen (filgrastim). An incomplete dose could increase infection risk. Ruptured spleen, sometimes fatal as well as serious lung problems, allergic reactions, kidney injuries and capillary leak syndrome have occurred. Report abdominal or shoulder tip pain, trouble breathing or allergic reactions to your doctor right away. In patients with sickle cell disorders, serious, sometimes fatal crises can occur. The most common side effect is bone and muscle ache. Ask your doctor about Neulasta Onpro. Pay no more than $5 per dose with copay card. So, if it's okay with you, I think maybe we could skip over the gory details of my family, because if we go through all the twists and turns, we're gonna be here all year, right? So, if I can just sum it all up by saying that my father was... distant, unapproachable, and a controlling figure in my life. He was, um...ruthless, and powerful, and I was simultaneously drawn to him and repelled by him. I rarely got his attention, and I never earned his love... Which would explain why I've had a string of hideous relationships with ruthless and unattainable men. You mentioned earning your father's love. Yeah, that's not your job to earn your father's love. Parental love is a gift -
- no strings attached. Then you don't know <i> my</i> family, because in my family, love is not a gift. It's a weakness to be exploited. And at what age did you realize that? Oh. Well, I have no idea, because I've blocked out most of my childhood. Did I mention that my stepmother murdered my mother -
- and I witnessed it? Um, you probably have suffered some, uh, post-traumatic stress. Have you ever been diagnosed or treated? No. So, uh, where does your father fit in here? Well, he was the only one that would -
- <i> could</i> check my stepmother, because he was as ruthless and cruel as she was. So perhaps you equate cruelty and ruthlessness to safety. Only powerful men -
- as selfish and unattainable as they are -
- assure you your survival. You know, I-I never really thought about it like that. Well... [ Notebook thuds ] ...if we decide to move forward, we can help you lead yourself to a better understanding of yourself. Start guiding you away from the people that are not good for you or to you, and maybe lead you to healthier relationships. I think I'd like that. So, another appointment? Yeah. I was hoping to save those words for Valentine's Day. Don't. Please. I won't. I love you. I love you, too. I love you very much. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up Kiki again for you... I really should be heading out... Uh, thank you for stopping by. If I come back, I'll bring ice packs. [ Chuckles ] You're welcome to stop by anytime. Just, um... do me a favor -
- work on those regrets. You're just too young to have that weighing on you. So are you. Harmony. To what do I owe the pleasure? You sound upbeat. Well, it is a beautiful night. And I have just discovered that a potential threat isn't so threatening at all. Well, I thought you should know... I just met with a Jason Morgan. He was questioning me about you. Yeah, yeah, I expected that. What's the upshot? I arranged for an assist from our favorite cop Billy. Oh, wonderful. Well, I hope he made Jason feel less than welcome. No, Billy did his part. Jason didn't seem to be intimidated, but I doubt he'll be back in Beechers Corners. He didn't learn anything we didn't want him to know. That's good. Hey! You just missed Sam. Or was that intentional? Uh, one of your -
- one of your bartenders is into Dawn of Day. What? Which one? No idea -
- Sonny was talking to him. Damn it. I mean, I can't fire him. But I also don't want him here lurking around, reporting everything back to Shiloh. I really wanted this to be a safe place for you and Sam. It's okay, Carly. We'll f-
- We'll find a safe place. [ Sighs ] I can't tell you how unsettling it is that this Shiloh guy was able to make inroads for a long time and no one noticed. [ Sighs ] Do you know that Dawn of Day was behind the clothing drive that the kids were a part of last fall? Mm-hmm. Had I known that, I would have never let Josslyn participate! Okay, okay, Josslyn is not vulnerable. She has a great sense of herself... Okay, it's Kristina. She's the one who's in deep. Really? Okay, do you think Sam's gonna be able to pull her out? I don't know. It might -
- It might help if Shiloh's distracted. You know, feeling a little pressure from the outside. What kind of pressure? I'm not sure. I took a trip up to Beechers Corners to check out the original Dawn of Day, and it did give me a good idea of how it works. But now... I got to figure out how to take it down.
