 THIS IS "DAILY BLAST LIVE." WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 ALWAYS LIVE, ALWAYS REAL,
 ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE.
 YOU'RE TOTALLY OFF BASE
 HERE.
 LOG ON AND JOIN OURS
 CONVERSATION.
 I DO AGREE WITH YOU.
 "DBL" STARTS RIGHT NOW.
 THREE, TWO -WELCOME TO "DBL."
 IT'S WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6th.
 LET'S GET STARTED.
 ALL MONTH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
 YOUR FAVORITE TV LEGENDS FROM
 THE PAST.
 TODAY WE'RE KICKING IT OFF WITH
 MARIANNE.
 SHE DISHES ABOUT HER FORT HOOD
 WITH GINGER AND WE'RE TALKING
 TO RANDY FROM SAY YES TO THE
 DRESS.
 FIRST.
 ALL EYES WERE ON THE PRESIDENT
 AS HE DELIVERED HIS SECOND
 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
 HE STRUCK A WIDELY BIPARTISAN
 STONE.
 HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT DID NOT
 BUDGE ON HIS KEY PROMISE FOR A
 WALL AND TOOK AIM AT THE
 GROWING INVESTIGATIONS AROUND
 HIM CALLING THEM RIDICULOUS AND
 PARTISAN.
 THERE WAS PAP MOMENT WHEN
 DEMOCRATIC WOMEN CLAD IN WHITE
 GOT TO THEIR FEET AND CHEERED.
 WE HAVE MORE WOMEN IN THE
 WORKFORCE THAN EVER BEFORE.
 DON'T SIT YET.
 YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS.
 WE ALSO HAVE MORE WOMEN SERVING
 IN CONGRESS THAN AT ANYTIME
 BEFORE.
 HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI
 CLAPPED BACK AT THE PRESIDENT
 IN HER SIGNATURE MOVE THAT SET
 THE INTERNET ON FIRE AT THE
 MEMES HAVE BEEN COMING IN.
 FINALLY WHEN I TELL MY WIFE I
 CLEANED THE BATHROOM.
 ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S GUESTS,
 AN 11-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS BULLIED
 BECAUSE HIS LAST NAME IS
 TRUMPED.
 HE'S GOING VIRAL, TOO, BECAUSE
 HE APPEARED TO FALL  LAY
 ASLEEP.
 HE'S A KID.
 I THOUGHT HE WAS PREPARED.
 HE HAD THE NAMES RIGHT.
 I THOUGHT -THAT'S A BIG
 MESSUP WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
 HE HAD PREPARED OBVIOUSLY FOR
 THAT.
 I LOVED IT WHEN THE WOMEN STOOD
 UP BUT EVERYBODY ON BOTH SIDES
 STARTED SCREAMING USA, USA.
 IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT.
 AND TO SEE THE WOMEN
 REPRESENT, THANK GOD WE ARE
 WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
 WE HAVE MORE PROGRESS TO GO BUT
 AN ODE TO THE SUFFRAGE
 MOVEMENT.
 THEY HIGHLIGHTEDDAL LIST
 JOHNSON, THE BLACK WOMAN WHO
 WAS EXONERATED FROM PRISON.
 I HOPE SHE BECOMES THE FACE OF
 A LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND BARS.
 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEHIND
 BARS IS STAGGERING.
 WE HAVE A FOURTH OF THE PEOPLE
 BEHIND BARS.
 THIS COUNTRY IS BUILT ON
 STOCKPILING HUMAN BEINGS AND
 PUTTING THEM IN CAGES.
 DON'T FORGET WHERE WE LIVE AND
 THIS CAN BE FIXED.
 PRISON REFORM.
 WHAT DID YOU THINK?
 I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS POSITIVE FOR
 THE MOST PART.
 I'M RIGHT DOWN THE AISLE ON
 THIS ONE.
 I WISH THEY WOULD FOCUS MORE ON
 THE PRESIDENT, NOT SO MUCH
 NANCY PELOSI AND THE PEOPLE
 CLAPPING.
 I DIDN'T LIKE HOW A LOT OF
 TIMES ONE SIDE WOULD STAND UP
 AND THE OTHER WOULD SIT DOWN.
 IF YOU'RE WATCHING AT HOME
 YOU'RE NOT FORMULATING YOUR OWN
 OPINION.
 YOU DISMISS WHAT HE SAID.
 I THINK A LOT OF WHAT HE SAID
 WAS POSITIVE.
 WHAT A GREAT POINT.
 IT'S HARD TO BE AN INDEPENDENT
 THINK ARE WHEN YOU'RE ALIGNED
 WITH YOUR PARTY AND YOU SEE
 YOUR PARTY STANDING.
 HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO FORM AN
 INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.
 SO WHEN THEY STAND AND SIT,
 IT'S TO SHOW RESPONSE.
 I WILL SUPPORT THIS
 LEGISLATION.
 I WON'T.
 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
 BUT IT'S BECOME MORE OF A
 DRINKING GAME.
 IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO STANDS AND
 WHO DOESN'T.
 WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU,
 TOO, "DBL" NATION.
 SEVERAL OF THE PRESIDENT'S
 RIVALS ARE IN THE NEWS, CORY
 BOOKER FINALLY ADMITTED HE'S
 GOT A SPECIAL SOMEONE.
 BEFORE I DECLARE SOMEONE,
 I'M DATING SOMEONE VERY
 SPECIAL.
 CORY BOOKER'S GOT A BOO.
 I LOVE IT.
 CORY BOOKER'S GOT A BOO.
 THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION
 HIS BOO IS ROSARIO DAWSON.
 THE TWO HAVE BEEN SEEN OUT
 TOGETHER AT A BROADWAY SHOW.
 OPRAH SAT DOWN WITH BETO
 O'ROURKE.
 SHE ENCOURAGED HIM TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT AND GOT HIM TO AGREE
 BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH.
 DOES IT STRIKE YOU THAT PEOPLE
 DO CONSIDER WHICH CELEBRITY'S
 ENDORSING A CANDIDATE?
 FOR INSTANCE, IF OPRAH IS GOING
 TO ENDORSE BETO O'ROURKE, WILL
 THAT INCREASE HIS CHANCES OF
 WINNING.
 SAME, DOES IT HELP OR HURT TO
 HAVE ROSARIO DAWSON, AN
 ACTIVIST AND ACTRESS BY HIS
 SIDE.
 I'M NOT GOING TO SAY I'M A
 FAN OF HIM OR NOT BUT I THINK
 HAVING A CELEBRITY ON YOUR SIDE
 HELPS.
 IF YOU'RE ENDORSED BY OPRAH.
 IS THAT THE BIGGEST
 ENDORSEMENT YOU CAN GET?
 OF COURSE.
 I DON'T THINK THE TIMING IS A
 COINCIDENCE WITHROSEROSARIO
 DAWSON.
 LET'S SAY SHE WENT TO THE
 WHITE HOUSE WITH HIM, WHETHER
 THEY'RE MARRIED OR JUST A
 COUPLE.
 SHE WOULD MAKE A GREAT, SO TO
 SPEAK, FIRST LADY.
 SHE ALREADY IS A MODERN
 FIRST LADY.
 SHE'S TECH LOGICALLY ADVANCED.
 SHE WOULD BE A HUGE BOOST AND
 IN TODAY'S CELEBRITY CULTURE.
 SEE, AL THINKS DIFFERENT.
 YOU THINK CELEBRITIES CAN HURT.
 THEY ALMOST THINK CELEBRITIES
 ALIGN WITH AN ELITIST MENTALITY
 THAT'S UNRELATABLE.
 DEPENDS ON THE CELEBRITY.
 IS IT ROSARIO DAWSON OR TED
 NUGENT.
 NOT ONLY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A
 MAJOR CELEBRITY BUT THEN HAVING
 SOME OF THESE SMALLER
 INFLUENCERS.
 WE SAW IT WORKED AT FIRE FEST.
 IF YOU TELL PEOPLE TO DO IT,
 THEY WILL DO IT.
 MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALIGNED
 WITH THEIR POLICIES.
 SUSAN LUCCI IS OPENING UP ABOUT
 A HEART SCARE.
 SHE SAID SHE FELT LIKE AN
 ELEPHANT STOMPING ON HER CHEST.
 TESTS SHOWED A 90% BLOCK IN ONE
 ARTERY AND 80% ON THE OTHER.
 I ASKED THE DOCTOR HOW IS MY
 HEART, MY ACTUAL HEART?
 HE SAID YOUR HEART IS THAT
 OF A 20-YEAR-OLD.
 HE SAID IT THREE TIMES, SO I
 BELIEVED HIM.
 I'M GLAD I WANT HOME.
 IF I WAS HOME I WOULD HAVE SAID
 OH, I JUST NEED TO LAY DOWN.
 FEBRUARY IS HEART MONTH.
 PART OF THE REASON LUCCI IS
 SPEAKING OUT, SHE HOPES OTHERS
 WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT HEART
 DISEASE.
 IN ADDITION TO CHEST PAIN
 THERE'S NAUSEA, VOLUME MITTING,
 SWEATING, FATIGUE, SHORTNESS OF
 BREATH.
 KEYS TO REDUCE IT WEIGHT
 MANAGEMENT, BEING ACTIVE,
 REDUCING STRESS AND MORE.
 THOSE ALL COMBINED WITH EACH
 OTHER.
 EXERCISING REDUCING STRESS.
 IF YOU KEEP THE EXERCISE, I
 THINK EVERYTHING ELSE WILL FALL
 INTO PLACE.
 AWARE NEXT TOO.
 WHEN YOU THINK OF HEART ATTACK
 YOU THINK ARM HURTING, RIGHT
 ARM.
 JAW PAIN.
 A DENTIST WILL TELL SOMEONE YOU
 NEED TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE
 HOSPITAL.
 MY GRANDFATHER HAD A QUADRUPLE
 BYPASS.
 IT SAVED HIS LIVE.
 "DBL" IS LIVE.
 COMING UP, MEGHAN MARKLE'S
 FRIENDS ARE OPENING UP ABOUT
 THE DUCHESS.
 PLUS, DESIGNER RANDY TELLS
 US HIS LEAST PART OF MEGHAN'S
 WEDDING GOWN.
 YOUR COMMENTS COMING UP NEXT.
 WELCOME BACK TO "DBL." BRIDES TAKING ON THEIR LAST
 NAME OF THEIR PARTNERS IS AN
 AGE-OLD TRADITION.
 NOWADAYS NEWLY WEDS HAVE
 OPTIONS.
 DO YOU ADD A HYPHEN OR STICK TO
 YOUR ROOTS.
 SHE CHOSE WHY SHE CHOSE TO TAKE
 ON HER HUSBAND'S NICK'S NAME.
 SHE SAID IT FELT LIKE THE
 BLENDING OF THE FAMILIES AND
 DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE HER.
 HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT DITCHING
 THE LAST NAME FOR THE PARTNER.
 ONE SAYS IF THE WOMAN IS
 CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY
 OF DIVORCE AND COMPLICATIONS
 AFTERWARDS, THE SIMPLE SOLUTION
 DON'T GET MARRIED.
 THAT IS TAKING A HAMMER TO AN
 ANT.
 HE  REALLY WENT AFTER IT.
 I GUESS THAT IS ONE WAY TO
 AVOID THE ISSUE, BUT I DON'T
 KNOW IF WE NEED TO ABOLISH
 MARRIAGE.
 JOHN FROM YOUTUBE SAID NO
 WOMAN SHOULD BE OBLIGATED TO
 DITCH THEIR LAST NAME.
 I PLAN ON TAKING MY GIRL'S LAST
 NAME.
 THAT WILL MAKE ME JOHNNY RUSH.
 HOW COOL DOES THAT SOUND.
 MY GOD BROTHER TOOK HIS LAST
 NAME JAGGER.
 I KEPT MINE BECAUSE I'M A
 COMEDIAN AND I THOUGHT PEOPLE
 KNEW ME AS TORY SHULMAN.
 WHY ARE YOU GUYS LAUGHING?
 SHE SAID I WAS 42 WHEN I GOT
 MARRIED.
 I NEVER TOOK MY HUSBAND'S NAME.
 HE NEVER GOT OVER IT.
 MY WIFE, I THINK IS TOO LAZE
 DI TO CHANGE HER LAST NAME.
 SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO THE
 DMV OR CHANGE HER CREDIT CARDS.
 I HAVE MY TWO SONS.
 THEY HAVE MY LAST NAME.
 I'M HAPPY.
 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
 COMMUNICATION.
 A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS ARISE
 WHEN CHILDREN COME INTO PLAY.
 I'M SCHACHER.
 SOPHIE'S SCHACHER.
 I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK
 DURING THE BREAK.
 PERFECT.
 ARIANA GRANDE IS CAUGHT UP WITH
 SOME DPRA A.
 ARIANA DRAMA.
 VARIETY REPORTS SHE WAS
 SUPPOSED TO PERFORM AT THE SHOW
 BUT CLASHED WITH THE PRODUCERS
 AFTER THEY REFUSED TO LET HER
 SING HER LATEST SINGLE "SEVEN
 RINGS."
 SHE PULLED OUT WHEN THEY SAID
 THEY WOULD BE CHOOSING SOME OF
 THE SONGS.
 SHE'S UP FOR TWO GRAMMYS ON
 SUNDAY.
 HER LATEST ALBUM IS OUT ON
 FRIDAY.
 THAT'S SOME PRETTY BIG
 PLANS.
 COMING UP, ONE ON ONE WITH TV
 ROYALTY.
 DAWN WELLS FROM GILLIGAN'S
 ISLAND WEIGHS IN ON THAT FEUD
 WITH GINGER.
 AND THEN RANDY FENOLI FROM
 "SAY YES TO THE DRESS."
 WHAT TREND MAKES HIS SKIN CRAWL
 AFTER THE BREAK.
 WELCOME BACK. I NEED ALL BRIDES TO BE TO
 LISTEN.
 HOW DOES A FREE WEDDING AND A
 TRIP TO THE ICONIC BRIDAL STORE
 SOUND?
 YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW AS I CATCH
 UP WITH DESIGNER RANDY FENOLI
 ABOUT HIS NEW TV SHOW.
 RANDY FENOLI, WELCOME TO "DBL."
 WHEN IT COMES TO WEDDING
 DRESSES, YOU ARE THE END ALL,
 BE ALL.
 OF COURSE, FANS KNOW YOU
 THROUGH "SAY YES TO THE DRESS"
 BUT YOU'VE ALSO LAUNCHED BRIDAL
 COLLECTIONS AND RECEIVED AWARDS
 FOR YOUR DESIGNS.
 I NEED TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS.
 THE MOST FAMOUS WEDDING DRESS
 OF 2019, MISS MEGHAN MARKLE.
 IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD
 HAVE CHANGED?
 FOR ME I THINKED VEIL WAS A
 LITTLE TOO LONG BUT I THINK THE
 DRESS FIT BEAUTIFULLY.
 I WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED
 ANYTHING.
 IT'S MORE ABOUT HELPING
 BRIDES FIND A DRESS.
 CAN YOU TELL US MORE.
 WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM
 THE ORIGINAL "SAY YES TO THE
 DRESS."
 WE'RE ASKING FOR BRIDES ALL
 ACROSS AMERICA TO SUBMIT A
 VIDEO TO TLC.COM AND THEY WILL
 HAVE AN ALL EXPENSE PAID TRIP
 TO KLEINFELD AND A RECEPTION
 FOR THE COUPLES AND THE
 BIGGEST, GRANDEST, MOST
 INCREDIBLE WEDDING CEREMONY IN
 AMERICAN HISTORY, I BELIEVE.
 TELL US IS UNFAIR.
 I'M ALREADY MARRIED.
 I WANT TO GET DIVORCED AND
 REMARRIED JUST SO I CAN BE ON
 THIS SHOW.
 DON'T GET DIVORCED.
 IF YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING
 ENOUGH VIDEO, I MEAN, WE MIGHT
 EVEN DO VOW RENEWALS.
 SEND US A VIDEO.
 I'M HAVING BUTTERFLIES.
 SO YOU'LL BE HELPING 50 BRIDES
 BE ON THE SHOW.
 WHILE THAT MAY SOUND LIKE A
 LOT, YOU'VE HELPED THOUSANDS
 AND THOUSANDS OF WOMEN.
 IF THERE'S ONE TREND YOU WISH
 WOULD DIE, WHICH TREND WOULD IT
 BE?
 I THINK BASICALLY THE ENTIRE
 1980s, THE SLEEVES, HIGH WASTE,
 FULL GATHERED SKIRT WITH LACE
 APPLIQUES ALL OVER.
 I'M GLAD WE CAN FORGET THE
 1980s IN FASHION.
 I AGREE.
 RANDY, THANK YOU FOR CATTING
 WITH US.
 CHATTING WITH US.
 YOU CAN HAVE RANDY, A DREAM
 COME TRUE.
 SEND IT TO TLC.COM/CASTING.
 COMING UP, TYRA BANKS IS
 TAKING A PAGE OUT OF THE WALT
 DISNEY PLAYBOOK AND "DBL" DRIVE
 COMING UP NEXT.
 WELCOME BACK TO "DBL." WELL, PHIL THE GROUNDHOG HAS
 SPOKEN AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT
 HOW WINTER WILL BE SHORTER THIS
 YEAR.
 THIS IS PRESENTED BY CAR
 SHIELD.
 OUR BROTHER FROM ANOTHER
 MOTHER, PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL DID
 NOT SEE HIS SHADOW.
 NO SHADOW.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS
 IN.
 I THINK WE'RE TRUSTING A
 RODENT MORE THAN SCIENTISTS.
 THESE SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN
 HERE LONGER THAN SHINE TISES
 AND THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED
 NATURE INSTINCTS.
 HOW DID THAT WORK OUT FOR
 THE DINOSAURS.
 THEY SAID WE'RE DONE.
 SPRING IS IN THE AIR.
 WE HAVE TIPS TO ENJOY THE
 WARMER WEATHER.
 GET THE INDOOR CHORES DONE SO
 WHEN THE GOOD WEATHER ROLLS IN
 YOU'RE READY TO EXPLORE.
 GET OUTSIDE AND ENJOY THE EARLY
 SUNSHINE.
 NO MATTER WHAT THE SEASON,
 DRIVE WITH PEACE OF MIND AND
 GET A PLAN WITH CARSHIELD.
 CALL 1-800-505-9619 FOR A FREE
 QUOTE.
 I LOVE WATCHING THE TWO OF
 YOU IN A CAR.
 WE LOVE IT.
 PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL DID NOT SEE
 HIS SHADOW WHICH SCIENTIFICALLY
 MEANS MORE SPRING.
 SPRING WILL BE SOONER.
 AL GOES WHERE IN PENNSYLVANIA
 DO YOU THINK HE'S FROM?
 PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL.
 THIS IS COMING UP NEXT.
 WOULD YOU GO TO A SUPER
 MODEL THEME PARK?
 TYRA BANKS IS HOPING YOU WILL.
 THEN WE'RE CATCHING UP WITH TV
 LEGEND DAWN WELLS, AKA FROM
 GILLIGAN'S ISLAND, WHAT SHE
 REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT GINGER AND
 HER MONEY TROUBLES AFTER THE
 SHOW ENDED AND "DBL" IS KEEPING
 YOU YOUNG.
 WE'RE
