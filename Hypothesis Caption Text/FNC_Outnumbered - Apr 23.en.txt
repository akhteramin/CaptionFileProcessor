 THE S&P 500 IS ON PACE FOR A RECORD CLOSE, THE FIRST OF 2019.
 FOR THOSE KEEPING TRACK IT WOULD
 BE THE 81ST RECORD CúOR THE
 STOCK MARKET UNDER
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 Bill: REMARKABLE.
 Katie: THERE IS A BOOMING
 STOCK MARKET OUT THERE.
 THAT'S IT FOR US. WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING.
 "OUTNUMBERED" STARTS NOW
 Katie: FOX NEWS ALERT
 , IN A SURPRISE DEFAMATION SUIT, TO GO CHICAGO BROTHERS CAUGHT UP
 IN AN ALLEGED HOAX CRIME
 ARE ASSUMING THE LAWYERS HAVEESR
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT.
 THE BROTHERS SAY THEIR NAMES
 HAVE BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH THE
 MUD OVER A LIE THAT THEY SAY WAS
 DIRECTED BY SMOLLETT HIMSELF.
 THIS IS "OUTNUMBERED" AND I'M
 MELISSA FRANCIS.
 HERE TODAY, COHOST OF
 "FOX & FRIENDS" FIRST, JILLIAN
 MELE.
 TOWN HALL EDITOR AND FOX NEWS
 CONTRIBUTOR, KATIE HAVE LUNCH.
 SYNDICATED RADIO HOST AND
 FOX NEWS CONTRg■@■@■@
 AND JOINING UN THETODAY FOR THE,
 CHARLIE KIRK.
 THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF TURNING
 POINT USA.
 SO GLAD TO GET YOU OUT HERE!
 Charlie: PLEASED TO BE
 HERE, THANK YOU.
 Melissa: DO YOU FEEL READY?
 Charlie: I HOPE SO!
 [LAUGHTER]
 THE TWO BROTHERS FILING AIT.
 DEFAMATIONINST
 SMOLLETT'S HA)■)
 ATTORNEYS, THE■Q BROTHERS WERE
 INITIALLY ARRESTED AS SUSPECTS
 IN THE ALLEGED ATTACK IN JANUARY
 BUT WERE LATER RELEASED.
 THEY ARE CLAIMING THA
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT PAID THEM "A SUM
 OF MONEY" TO STAGE AN ATTACK TO
 BENEFIT HIMSELF.
 THEY ADD THA THE A DIRECTED
 EVERY ASPECT OF THE INCIDENT.
 SMOLLETT MAINTAINS THE ATTACK
 WAS NOT STAGED.
 HERE'S AN ATTORNEY FOR THE
 BROTHERS READING THEIR STATEMEN
 STATEMENT.
 THESE LIES ARE DESTROYING OUR
 CHARACTER AND OUR REPUTATION IN
 OUR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL
 LIVES.
 THOSE WHO KNOW US PERSONALLY
 KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE HATE FOR
 ANYONE THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE.
 WE WILL NO LONGER SIT BACK AND
 ALLOW THESE LIES TO CONTINUE.
 Melissa: MIKE TOBIN'S LIVE
 IN CHICAGO WITH THE LATEST.
 MIKE?
 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS
 LAWSUIT DOES NOT NAME
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT AS A DEFENDANT,
 RATHER, HE NAMES HIS LEGAL TEAM.
 THEY SAY THAT AFTER ALL THE
 CHARGES WERE DROPPED AGAINST THE
 ACTOR, ATTORNEYS MARK GARY GOSE
 AND TINA STARTED
 DOING THE ROUNDS ON NEWS PROGRAMS AND BLAMED THE ATTACK
 OF THE BROTHERS.
 THEY CLAIMED THAT THE STATEMENTS
 DAMAGED THE REPETITION OF THE
 BROTHERS CAR THEIR BUSINESS, AND
 CONSUMMATE THEM EMOTIONAL
 DISTRESS.
 THEY'RE ASKING FOR DAMAGES AND
 LEGAL COSTS.
 LAWYERS FOR THE BROTHERS SAY
 THEY WANT TO CLEAR THE NAME OF
 TWO GUYS WHO WERE JUST TRYING TO
 MAKE IT AS ACTORS AND DID WHAT
 SUCCESSFUL ACTORS TOLD THEM TO
 DO.
 THEY SAY THEY WANT TO CLEAR
 INTERPRETATION OF THE CITY IN
 THE LAWSUIT DOES SAY THAT
 Sandra: DIRECTED THE OLD
 THING
 THEY WERE ASKED TO DO SOME BIG DRIVER AND THEY TRUSTED.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT
 FRIEND BETRAYED THEIR TRUST.
 THE LAWSUIT SAYS THAT THEY
 CLAIMED ON THE "UNREASONABLE
 DOUBT" PODCAST THAT THE YOUNGER
 BROTHER BRIEFLY ENGAGED IN
 HOMOSEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT.
 THAT STORY FLOATED BY THE
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT LEGAL TEAM FOR
 BY THE BROTHERS WOULD HAVE
 ATTACKED SMOLLETT IF IT WAS NOT
 AT HIS DIRECTION.
 ACCORDING TO A SOURCE FROM THE
 SMOLLETT TEAM, ONE BROTHER WAS
 WORRIED THAT THE OTHER ONE WAS
 GAY AND DIRECTED HIM TO BE THAT
 THE ACTOR TO PROVE HE WASN'T
 GAY.
 THE LAWSUIT SAYS THAT
 HOMOSEXUALITY■÷■÷■÷■>■>■÷z÷ NOTF
 IN NIGERIAN CULTURE.
 Melissa: WOW.
 THANK YOU FOR THAT.
 CHARLIE?
 THAT WAS QUITE A NEW REVELATION
 FOR PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T
 FOLLOWING IT ON THE SITES THAT
 PUT OUT THINGS THAT ARE NOT
 REPORTED ELSEWHERE.
 Charlie: I'M FROM CHICAGO
 AND IT'S A TOTAL DISGRACE.
 I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
 WITH THE STORY ASSUMES THEY
 HEARD THAT NEGATIVE 2 DEGREES
 WEATHER, HE ALLEGED SOMEBODY
 SAID, "THIS IS MAGA COUNTRY."
 I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE IN
 COOK COUNTY USE THAT LANGUAGE
 WHATSOEVER.
 THERE NEEDS TO BE JUSTICE SERVED
 HERE.
 IT'S HORRIBLE THAT THOSE FELONY
 COUNTS WERE DISMISSED.
 THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE,
 BOTH DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN,
 AND CHICAGO.
 IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WAS A
 CELEBRITY DOUBLE STANDARD HERE.
 THAT HE GOT TREATED DIFFERENTLY.
 Melissa: IT'S AN
 INTERESTING APPROACH THROUGH THE
 LAWYERS AND NOT THE ACTOR
 HIMSELF, FOR DEFAMATION.
 PUTTING IT ON THEM, THAT THE
 BROTHERS' CHARACTER HAS BEEN
 DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD.
 OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE HERE IS LYING.
 MAYBE THIS IS A WAY TO GET IT IN
 COURT TO IDENTIFY WHO IS TELLING
 THE TRUTH AND HE WAS LYING.
 Leslie: IT SHOULD HAVE
 BEEN.
 DID AGREE?
 [LAUGHTER]
 OH, MY GOD!
 THIS IS A GOOD START TO A WEEK
 THEN.
 WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE STANDING
 THERE SAYING, "WE ARE BEING
 DEFAMED BECAUSE WE TOOK MONEY
 FROM AN ACTOR TO PRETEND TO BEAT
 HIM UP, TO MAKE HIM LOOK BETTER,
 AND TO MAKE THIS LOOK LIKE AN
 ANTI--GAY AND EVEN ANTIBLACK
 CRIME," I'M SORRY, YOU MESSED UP
 YOUR CHARACTER IF YOU ARE
 ALLEGING THIS IS TRUE.
 I'M GLAD IT WILL GO TO COURT
 BECAUSE THIS IS TERRIBLE.
 THINK ABOUT THE RESOURCES AND,
 IN ADDITION TO THAT, HOW MANY
 VICTIMS OUT THERE OF RACISM AND
 HOW MANY VICTIMS OF HOMOPHOBIA
 IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THERE
 ARE -I LIVED IN CHICAGO FOUR
 YEARS AND THIS IS TERRIBLE,
 ESPECIALLY IN A CITY THAT HAS A
 LOT OF TENSION ALONG THE LINES
 OF RACE.
 Jillian: IF I COULD BE
 BETTER TO AGREE, I GUESS, AT THE
 END OF THE DAY THEY ARE ADULTS.
 THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SAID,
 "YES, WE WILL DO THIS FOR YOU TO
 GET PAID."
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY ARE
 THE ONES YOU SEE ON THE
 SURVEILLANCE VIDEO PURCHASING
 THE THINGS USED IN THIS ALLEGED
 HOAX.
 SO I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING
 THEY ARE VICTIMS IN THIS CASE.
 Katie: THE NEED TO BE HELD
 RESPONSIBLE, MAYBE NOT LEGALLY,
 BUT PARTICIPATING IN CARRYING
 OUT A FAKE HATE CRIME AND THEN
 BLAMING WHITE PEOPLE AND
 TRUMP SUPPORTERS FOR THAT HATE
 CRIME.
 THAT'S THE FIRST THING.
 THAT BEING SAID, THE FACT THAT
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT IS GETTING AWAY
 WITH ALL THIS, HIS ATTORNEY WENT
 ON "THE TODAY SHOW" AND ACCUSE
 THE BROTHERS OF MAYBE WEARING
 WHITE FACE AND THAT SO HE SAID
 THERE WERE WHITE MEN WHO
 ATTACKED HIM WHEN HE WAS TALKING
 TO POLICE.
 THE THINGS THEY'VE SAID IN HIS
 DEFENSE DEFINITELY NOT ONLY
 DEFAMED THE BROTHERS, THEY ARE
 SAYING THEY STILL CARRIED IT
 OUT, EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T LIKE
 HE SAID THEY WERE WHITE.
 BUT THE POLITICAL APPLICATIONS
 HAVE BEEN DROPPED WHEN IT COMES
 TO THE DISCUSSION.
 THEY SMEARED AN ENTIRE GROUP OF
 AMERICANS AND IT COULD HAVE
 CAUSED A LOT MORE DAMAGE IN
 TERMS OF THE CULTURE AND
 DISCOURSE IN THIS COUNTRY AS A
 RESULT OF WHAT THEY DID.
 Melissa: KNEW DETAILS FROM
 INARY CONCALL
 WITH DEMOCRATIC■MITTEE CHAIR,
 SPEAKER PELOSI URGING FELLOW
 DEMOCRATS TO FOCUS ON
 INVESTIGATIONS RATHER THAN
 IMPEACHMENT IN THE WAKE OF THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT ON
 RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN TH■?■■■■
 ELECTION.
 SPEAKER PELOSI REPORTEDLY
 TELLING A
          ■@■@■@■@■@■yUT DEMOCRAR REPUBLICANS, IT'S SAVING
 WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ARTICLES
 OF IMPEACHMENT TO GET THE
 FACTS."
 THEY TELL FOX NEWS THAT
 MAXINE WATERS SPOKE UP SAYING
 SHE STILL SUPPORTS IMPEACHMENT
 BUT WON'T SEEK TO INFLUENCE
 ANYONE ELSE ON EDGE.
 THE DEMOCRATIC 2020 CONTENDERS
 LIKE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS SEE
 NO NEED FOR CAUTION, THOUGH.
 WATCH.
 I BELIEVED CONGRESS SHOULD
 TAKE THE STEPS TOWARD
 IMPEACHMENT.
 BUT I'M ALSO A REALIST.
 REPUBLICANS HOLD A MAJORITY.
 I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO
 SUGGEST THEY WILL BE ON THE
 FACTS INSTEAD OF ON PARTISAN
 ADHERENCE TO BEING PROTECTIVE OF
 THIS PRESIDENT.
 AND THAT IS WHAT CONCERNS ME AND
 WHAT WILL BE THE EVENTUAL
 OUTCOME.
 SO WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT
 WHAT MIGHT BE THE END RESULT,
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE
 PROCESS SHOULD NOT TAKE HOLD.
 Melissa: REPUBLICAN MIKE
 TURNER SITS ON THE HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SAYS
 THERE IS PLENTY OF WORK THAT
 CONGRESS NEEDS TO DO INSTEAD OF
 FOCUSING ON INVESTIGATIONS, AND
 HE FELT SPEAKER PELOSI FORGIVING
 ENERGY TO A MOVEMENT TO
 INVESTIGATE THE PRESIDENT.
 I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
 DISSENSION IN THE PARTY.
 AT THE SAME TIME, SHE IS GIVING
 TREMENDOUS ENCOURAGEMENT TO THIS
 INVESTIGATION AD NAUSEAM.
 THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON ISSUES
 SUCH AS RUSSIA AND CHINA,
 NORTH KOREA AND IRAN.
 BUT SHE HAS ENCOURAGED
 ADAM SCHIFF AND HIS MINIONS TO
 CONTINUE THEIR PURSUIT OF
 DONALD TRUMP AS IF HE'S THE MOST
 SNAGGED A
 THREAT TO OUR SECURITY INSTEAD OF OUR FOES.
 IT'S CIRCUMVENTING ROOM WERE
 GOING TO BE DONE.
 Melissa: REPORTING OF THE
 WHITE HOUSE BELIEVES THERE IS NO
 CHANCE THAT PROCEEDINGS WILL
 BEGIN, AND EVEN IF IT DID, IT
 WOULD BE A GIFT FOR THE
 PRESIDENT.
 ONE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
 TELLING THE PUBLICATION, "THE
 WHITE HOUSE IS SO UNCONCERNED
 THAT IT DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A
 STRATEGY IN PLACE FOR RESPONDIN/
 TO IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS."
 Charlie: DO YOU BELIEVE
 THERE
 IS NO PLAN BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK
 IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? DO YOU THINK IT'S SMART?
 Charlie: I BELIEVE THERE IS
 SOME PLAN.
 IF THE DEMOCRATS REALLY WANT TO
 GO FORWARD WITH THESE ARTICLES
 OF IMPEACHMENT -AND LET'S JUST
 SAY IN A HYPOTHETICAL WORLD THAT
 IT PASSES.
 IT WON'T GO TO THE CENTER.
 EVERYONE KNOWS THERE'S HAVE ONLY
 BEEN TO PRESIDENTS IMPEACHMENT
 ONLY A FEW REMOVED.
 ANOTHER LETTER I WORD --
 INDEPENDENCE.
 UNEMPLOYMENT GOING DOWN, WHICH
 IS GOING UP, PIECE HAPPENING
 ACROSS THE WORLD.
 THEY WANT TO SEE THAT PRESIDENT
 IN PHP ARE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE
 WANT TO SEE UNITY, BIPARTISAN
 REFORM, AND IF THE DEMOCRATS USE
 THEIR ENERGY ON THAT, THEY WILL
 LOSE INDEPENDENTS IN 2020.
 Melissa: THERE IS SOMEONE
 FOCUS ON IMPEACHMENT AND WANTS
 IT, AND THAT IS TOM STEYER, WHO
 TOOK OUT AN AD.
 SAYING, " ALL HERE, TEN
 DETAILED ACTS OF OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE."
 THE ROBERT MUELLER REPORT LAYS
 OUT IMPEACHMENT FOR THE
 PRESIDENT."
 IT GOES ON TO SAY, "CONGRESS, DO
 YOUR JOB.
 I'M TOM STEYER."
 BUT THAT MESSAGE OUT.
 OBVIOUSLY VERY INFLUENTIAL IN
 THE PARTY.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 Leslie: I INTERVIEWED TOM
 STEYER AND ASKED HIM POINT BLAN
 BLANK, BECAUSE TO KAMALA HARRIS'
 POINT, THERE ARE REALITIES.
 IF IT PASSES THE HOUSE, YOU HAVE
 A DIVISION AMONG THE MOST
 CENTRIST
 LIKE --
 HE OF THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE SENATE AND WE HAVE HISTORY O
 LOOK TO.
 WHAT HAPPENS THERE REPUBLICANS
 BUILD PRESIDENT DOMINIC■■■■■
 CLINTON
 WHAT DOMINIC WAS IMPEACHED? NEWT GINGRICH --
 WHAT HE SAID IS, AND SOME PEOPLE IN CONGRESS FEEL THIS WAY, MAYBE
 ON THE FENCE AS TO WHETHER THEY
 WILL BE ON AOC'S SIDE OR
 PELOSI'S SIDE OF HIS ARGUMENT
 WHICH IS THAT PROGRESS HAS A
 RESPONSIBLE LEAD TO THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE, TO CONSTITUTION, TO DO
 THE INVESTIGATION.
 EVEN IF IT WON'T PASS IN THE
 SENATE, BRING THE ARTICLES OF
 IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR
 POSITION.
 NOT JUST THEIR POSITION, THEIR
 CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO
 HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
 SPECIFICALLY THE PRESIDENT.
 AND HE LOOKED TO TWO ISSUES --
 OBSTRUCTION AND WITNESS
 TAMPERING.
 Katie: I THINK IT'S AMAZING
 THAT WE ARE CALLING NANCY PELOSI
 A MODERATE DEMOCRAT NOW.
 SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN EXTREMIST.
 WE JUST HAVE MORE EXTREMISTS IN
 THE PARTY.
 Leslie: SHE IS PRETTY
 MODERATE.
 Katie: WE'VE GONE FROM
 BOB MUELLER AS THE END ALL BE
 ALL, WE TRUST WHAT HE'S GOING TO
 SAY, WE WILL PROTECT HIM,
 BLODGETT
  WE
 WANTED TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION
 TO PROTECT THEM.
 MULTIPLE TIMES THEY WOULDN'T
 VOTE ON IT.
 AND HERE WE ARE, WITHOUT ANY
 KIND OF COLLUSION AND DEMOCRATS
 WANT TO FOCUS ON AND OBSTRUCTION
 KIND OF YOU
  THAT THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS DOESN'T
 PLAY OUT.
 MY QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATS -YOU
 SUBPOENAED DOWN AGAIN YESTERDAY
 TO COME IN FRONT OF THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, OR THE
 HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.
 OUT OF THE 30 HOURS OF WHAT HE
 TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF MUELLER
 ABOUT -WHICH IS IN THE
 REPORT -WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
 FIND BASED ON THE RESOURCES THAT
 YOU HAVE AS INVESTIGATORS THAT
 BOB MUELLER DIDN'T FIND?
 THE ANSWER IS NOTHING.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF
 TALKING ABOUT A PATIENT HAS A
 TALKING POINT FOR POLITICAL
 REASONS, AND ACTUALLY THE
 BENEFIT OF INTRODUCING ARTICLES
 AND VOTING ON IT BECAUSE THEY
 KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO GO
 ANYWHERE.
 SO THEY WILL SAY TO THEIR BASE,
 "WE VOTED ON IMPEACHMENT, WE
 TRIED," AND THE REPUBLICANS
 DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD THE
 ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE.
 WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WE FEEL BY
 THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, AT
 THIS POINT MOST PEOPLE THINK IT
 WAS A WITCH HUNT AND HIS
 CREDIBILITY WENT DOWN BY THE END
 OF THE INVESTIGATION.
 PEOPLE JUST WANT TO MOVE ON.
 IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD BUT I
 THINK THE WHITE HOUSE IS MORE
 PREPARED THAN THEY ARE LETTING
 ON FOR THE INVESTIGATION.
 Jillian: AND TO YOUR POINT
 ABOUT IT BEING A T POINT,
 FOR SOMEONE LIKE
 KAMALA HARRIS -WHO KNOWS THAT
 HER BASE LOVES THE IMPEACHMENT
 TALK -THEY WILL KEEP TALKING
 ABOUT IT.
 FOR THE REST OF THE DEMOCRATS, I
 FEEL LIKE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS
 NO COLLUSION.
 SO WE KNEW PEOPLE WOULD HANG
 ONTO SOMETHING.
 YOU KNEW THEY WOULD STILL
 POUNDING THE PAVEMENT ABOUT
 SOMETHING.
 THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
 Melissa: FOR
 KAMALA HARRIS --
 Jillian: THE DEMOCRATIC
 BASE.
 Melissa: HER AREA OF THE
 COUNTRY, WHAT SHE REPRESENTS
 NOW, LOVES IMPEACHMENT.
 BUT IF SHE'S GOING FOR A BROADER
 VOTE AND SHE'S TRYING TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT, DOES IT STILL MAKES
 SENSE FOR HER, CHARLIE?
 Charlie: IN MANHATTAN AND
 MALIBU, IMPEACHMENT IS VERY
 POPULAR.
 Leslie: THERE'S A FEW OTHER
 CITIES.
 Charlie: IN MANHATTAN,
 KANSAS, IT'S NOT AS POPULAR.
 ALL KIDDING ASIDE, MIDDLE
 AMERICA IS STARTING TO SEE THE
 REVITALIZATION THAT THEY'VE BEEN
 PROMISED FOR DECADES.
 WHICH IS GOING UP, MANY
 FRACTURING COMING BACK, AND
 IMPLEMENT AT RECORD LOW LEVELS.
 JUST TODAY, THEY SAID THERE'S
 THE LOW EVER BLACK AND HISPANIC
 ON EMPLOYMENT.
 THE RADICAL LEFT, THEY ARE
 DEMANDING REVENGE.
 THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN OVER THE
 FACT THAT THEY LOSS IN 2016.
 THIS IS THEIR WAY TO TRY AND GET
 BACK AT IT.
 AT THIS POINT I AGREE --
 CONGRESS DOES HAVE AN OVERSIGHT
 CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY, 100%.
 BUT THEY ALSO DELEGATED THAT TO
 ROBERT MUELLER.
 WE WERE TOLD FOR TWO,
 "GIVE HIM SPACE, GIVE HIM YEARS,
 GIVEN $30 MILLION."
 NOW THE REPORT COMES OUT AND
 THEY HAVE NO COLLUSION.
 Katie: THEY SAID THEY
 WEREN'T INTERESTED IN
 give  $30 million."
 BECAUSE MUELLER WAS PAID THAT'S
 WHAT THEY SAID.
 Charlie: "LET MUELLER DO
 IT."
 I'LL I'M CONFUSED, WILL THEY
 IMPEACH THEM FOR?
 BECAUSE THEY ARE UPSET THAT THEY
 LOST?
 Melissa: TEN ARTICLES OF
 OBSTRUCTION.
 Charlie: IF THEY HAD A CASE
 OF OBSTRUCTION, HE WOULD HAVE
 REFERRED THAT.
 Leslie: THE DIFFERENCE HERE
 IS THAT SEPARATING CRIMINAL,
 WHICH WAS HIS RESPONSE BUILDING,
 POLITICAL, WHICH IS ENOUGH AGO,
 WHICH IS CONGRESSIONAL
 RESPONSIBLY.
 Charlie: HIGH CRIMES AND
 MISDEMEANORS.
 IN THE CONSTITUTION IS AS HIGH
 CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.
 SO WHAT CRIME HAVE BEEN CUSTOM
 WORK Leslie: I KNOW IT SAYS
 IN THE CONSTITUTION.
 THE INTERPRETATION OF THE
 CONSTITUTION -AND EVEN FORMER
 PRESRALD FORD SAID IT --
 "IMPEACHMENT IS WHATEVER THE
 HOUSE MAJORITY DEEMS IT TO BE AT
 THE TIME."
 Charlie: HIGH CRIMES AND
 MISDEMEANORS IS IN THE ACTUAL
 LANGUAGE.
 NIXON WAS EVER IMPEACHED.
 ANDREW JOHNSON WAS FOR A HIGH
 CRIME, CLINTON WAS IMPEACHED.
 Melissa: AT THIS TIME
 YESTERDAY WE SHOWED A GRAPHIC
 REFERENCING A TREAT FROM
 RESIDENT TRIBE REGARDING
 MITT ROMNEY'S NOMINATION.
 THE GRAPH SHOULD HAVE SAID 2012,
 NOT 2016.
 WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE ERROR.
 COMING UP, THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON
 THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ACCUSING
 THE WHITE HOUSE OF STONEWALLING
 AFTER LAWYERS FOR
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SUE TO BLOCK
 SUBPOENAS FOR HIS PERSONAL
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION.
 IS HE RIGHT, OR ARE DEMOCRATS
 INVESTIGATIONS TOO FAR?
 PLUS, 2020 DEMOCRATI
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CONTINUE
 TO PUSH A LIBERAL POLICIES
 INCLUDING PLANS TO CANCEL
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND FINE
 EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON GUN CONTROL
 AND MORE.
 WHETHER VOTERS WILL EMBRACE
 THEIR IDEAS, WE WILL DEBATE IT.
 NEXT.
 ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY
 ADMINISTRATION, I WILL PUT IN
 PLACE A MORATORIUñgñ/w
 NO NEW DRILLING, NO NEW MINING
 ON ANY FEDERAL LAND.

 WE ARE GOING TO ROLLBACK
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR ABOUT 95%
 OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE IT.
 THAT'S PART ONE.
 PART TWO IS TO MAKE SURE WE
 NEVER GET IN THIS MESS AGAIN ON
 THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT, AND THAT
 IS TO MAKE COLLEGE UNIVERSALLY
 AVAILABLE WITH FREE TUITION AND
 FEES.
 Katie: 2020 DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL,
 SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN,
 ROLLING OUT AMBITIOUS LIBERAL
 POLICY PROPOSALS AT A TOWN HALL
 LAST NIGHT.
 WARREN ADDRESSING THE STUDENT
 DEBT CRISIS.
 HER PLAN INCLUDES CANCELING
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT, ELIMINATING
 N AND FEES AT PUBLIC
 COLLEGES, AND GREATER SUPPORT
 FOR MINORITY AND LOW INCOME
 STUDENTS.
 HERE IS HOW SHE WOULD PAY FOR
 IT -MAKING SUPER WEALTHY
 AMERICANS PAY MORE IN TAXES.
 I STARTED IN SEVERAL MONTHS
 AGO TALKING ABOUT A WEALTH TAX.
 AN ULTRA MILLIONAIRE'S TAX.
 NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT THAT GREAT
 FORTUNE, SPEND JUST A MINUTE TO
 REMEMBER HOW YOU GOT IT.
 AND WE SAY, "GOOD FOR YOU, THAT
 YOU HAVE NO GOTTEN THIS GREAT
 FORTUNE.
 BUT TWO SENSE -YOU'VE GOT TO
 PAY SOMETHING BACK SO EVERYONE
 ELSE GET THE CHANCE."
 Katie: CRITICS AIRPLANE TO
 BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND
 WOULD SPUR MORE AGGRESSIVE TAX
 AVOIDANCE.
 MEANTIME, PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND
 FELLOW SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS IN
 ANOTHER TOWN HALL SAYING SHE
 WILL
 USE THE POWER OF THE PEN TO COUNTER GUN CONTROL OF CONGRESS
 IS NOT.
 I WILL GIVE THEM 100 DAYS TO
 GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND HAVE
 THE COURAGE TO PASS REASONABLE
 GUN SAFETY LAWS.
 IF THEY FAIL TO DO IT, THEN I
 WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION.
 WHAT I WILL DO IS PUT IN HER CAR
 MENTOR EVERYONE WHO SELLS MORE
 THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR -THEY
 ARE REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND
 CHECKS WHEN THEY SELL THOSE
 GUNS.
  Katie: MELISSA, I■# TO
 GO TO FIRST ON THE MONEY ASPECT
 OF THE STUDENT LOAN SITUATION.
 IT'S COMPLICATED.
 WAS YOUR RESPONSE TO
 ELIZABETH WARREN'S PROPOSAL?
 Melissa: HOW TO PAY FOR IT
 IS ALWAYS TO TAX THE RICH.
 EVERYONE SAYS THAT EVERY TIME.
 REMEMBER WHEN THEY TRIED THAT IN
 FRANCE AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF
 PEOPLE LEFT?
 DIDN'T WORK.
 THE REAL POINT WAS THEY DIDN'T
 TAKE IN NEARLY THE REVENUE THAT
 THEY HAD CALCULATED.
 BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE TOO
 SMART AND THEY LEFT THE COUNTRY.
 THEY EVENTUALLY HAD TO REPEAL
 IT.
 IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
 I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IF YOU
 CONFISCATED THE WEALTH OF THE
 TOP 1% AND THREW THEM IN JAIL
 AND TOOK AWAY EVERYTHING THEY
 EARNED IN A YEAR, IT WOULD BE A
 FEW TRILLION DOLLARS AND YOU
 COULDN'T PAY FOR ALL OF THESE
 PROGRAMS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.
 MEDICARE FOR ALL, STUDENT LOAN,
 ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH RICH PEOPLE
 TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY WANT TO.
 EVEN IF HE TOOK AWAY THEIR
 EARNINGS AND THROUGH THEM IN
 JAIL.
 Katie: CHARLIE, YOUR FORTE
 IS WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE,
 YOUNG MILLENNIALS WERE IN
 COLLEGE COME OUT OF COLLEGE.
 WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT
 HER PROPOSAL?
 FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK
 IT'S VERY FAIR FOR STUDENTS WHO
 WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE
 AND HAD MANAGEABLE STUDENT LOAN
 DEBT.
 THIS CATERS TO STUDENTS THAT HAD
 TENS OF THOUSANDS AND HUNDREDS
 OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN
 STUDENT LOANS.
 I THINK THEY ARE VICTIMS AND A
 LOT OF SENSE.
 THERE'S ALSO SO MUCH
 MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS,
 THOUGH.
 EVEN CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS
 A COUPLE THINGS GO THOUGHT SHE
 WOULD DO A GOTCHA QUESTION AT
 THE BIG BANKS, ASKING WHAT THEY
 WERE DOING ABOUT STUDENT LOANS.
 LITTLE DOES SHE KNOW, MOST OF
 THEM ARE GIVEN OUT BY THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
 WE'VE NATIONALIZED OUR STUDENT
 LOAN INDUSTRY.
 ALSO, TO SENATOR WARREN, WE NEED
 TO ASK A QUESTION -SHOULD WE
 HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE GOING TO
 FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE THAT WE HAVE
 GOING TO COLLEGE RIGHT NOW?
 THE ANSWER IS NO.
 THE NATIONAL GRADUATION RATE IS

 THAT MEANS 41% OF PEOPLE WHO
 ENTER COLLEGE WILL NOT GRADUATE.
 WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE GOING TO
 FOR YOUR COLLEGE.
 IS IT WORTH GETTING INTO DEBT?
 THESE ARE QUESTIONS WE SHOULD
 ADDRESS BEFORE YOU SAY WE SHOULD
 FORGIVE IT.
 AND ALSO TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM
 PEOPLE HAVE 11 BE QUITE
 SUCCESSFUL TO PAY FOR A
 COMPLETELY BROKEN SYSTEM.
 FINAL POINT, WHY NOT TAX THE
 ENDOWMENTS?
 SHE IS SO SILENT OF THOSE.
 I'LL TELL YOU WHY -SHE GETS
 CONTRIBUTIONS.
 SHE WANTS TO WORK WITH THE
 BIGGEST ENDOWMENTS OF THE WORLD.
 Katie: JILLIAN, YOU WERE
 NODDING HER HEAD.
 Jillian: YOU ARE TALKING
 ABOUT THE KIDS HE WORKED TO PUT
 THEMSELVES THROUGH COLLEGE.
 WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
 WORKED THEIR ENTIRE LIVES AND
 CAME FROM NOTHING TO BE ABLE TO
 MAKE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES AND
 MAKE THEMSELVES PERHAPS
 SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRES?
 WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR
 EVERYTHING FROM OTHER PEOPLE?
 GOING BACK TO THAT WHOLE 2% TAX
 ON FAMILIES WITH $50 MILLION OR
 ABOVE, I GET IT, YOU'VE GOT A
 LOT OF MONEY, BUT AT THE SAME
 TIME IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU GIVE IT
 AWAY.
 Katie: LESLIE, I'M WANTING
 THE DEMOCRAT RESPONSE HERE.
 SHE'S ARGUING WE HAVE TO STOP
 HER FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, WHICH
 I AGREE WITH.
 BUT AS WE SEE THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT HANDING OUT LOANS
 WITHOUT ANY KIND OF RETURN ON
 INVESTMENT OR REAL CALCULATION
 OF WHAT IS GOING TO MEAN IN
 TERMS OF THE CAREER YOU GO INTO,
 WE SEE THIS MASSIVE PROBLEM AND
 CRISIS WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
 AND NOW REGULAR PEOPLE AND
 FELLOW MILLENNIALS -THERE'S
 LOTS OF THE LIMOS WHO HAVE
 MORTGAGES.
 SHOULD WE ALSO BAIL THEM OUT ON
 THAT?
 WHERE DOES IT END?
 Leslie: FIRST OF ALL, WE
 HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVERY
 PERSON WE ARE HEARING FROM --
 ELIZABETH WARREN AS WELL, IS
 CAMPAIGNING TO GET THAT
 NOMINATION FOR DEMOCRAT
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 SHE HAS A SEPARATE HERSELF FROM
 THE REST.
 A LARGE NUMBER OF HER SUPPORTERS
 ARE BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTERS,
 WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN THE POLL
 THAT MILLENNIALS LOVE BERNIE.
 FOR TWO REASONS.
 FREE COLLEGE TUITION HAS
 BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.
 THE LEFT AND RIGHT, PEOPLE SAY
 IT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM THAT NEEDS
 TO BE FIXED.
 ANOTHER THING, WHEN
 BETO O'ROURKE STOOD UP A COUPLE
 WEEKS AGO AND GAVE OUT HIS GREAT
 TALK, THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT
 SAID, "WHAT IS YOUR SPECIFIC
 PLAN FOR THAT?"
 AND HE COULDN'T ANSWER THAT.
 TO HER CREDIT, SHE SAID, "THIS
 IS MY SPECIFIC PLAN."
 IT'S VERY AMBITIOUS, I DON'T
 THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT
 WOULDN'T BEEN ABLE TO BE
 ENFORCED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE
 THAT WEALTHY BECAUSE THEY HAVE
 THE ABILITY TO HIRE PEOPLE TO
 HAVE THE MONEY.
 Melissa: WHY DON'T YOU MAKE
 THE UNIVERSITY'S PAY FOR IT?
 INSTEAD OF THE TAXPAYER BEING
 THE ONE TO FOOT THE BILL FOR ALL
 THIS DEBT, THE UNIVERSITIES OF
 THE ONE THAT ARE GRADUATING
 PEOPLE WITH DEGREES THAT ARE, BY
 DEFINITION -BECAUSE THEY ARE
 NOT BEING PAID BACK -NOT WORTH
 WHAT PEOPLE PAID FOR THEM.
 THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GET A JOB
 AND PAY BACK THE DEBT BECAUSE
 THE DEGREE WASN'T WORTH HOW MUCH
 OF COLLEGE CHARGED FOR IT.
 IN A NORMAL MARKET IT WOULD BE
 THE COLLEGE THAT TOOK THE HIT.
 THAT GOES BACK TO YOUR IDEA OF
 THE ENDOWMENTS.
 MAKE THE COLLEGE STOMACH THE
 LOSS.
 THEY WILL GET THEIR FINANCES IN
 ORDER, THEY WILL GET THEIR
 PRICES IN LINE.
 BUT JUST SLOUGHING EVERYTHING
 OFF ON THE TAXPAYER IS THIS
 UNNAMED PERSON.
 THERE IS NO INCENTIVE THERE, AS
 YOU SAID.
 Melissa: I WANT TO GET A
 RESPONSE TO KAMALA HARRIS ON THE
 GUN-CONTROL ISSUE.
 Charlie: FIRST OF ALL, ANY
 EXECUTIVE ACTION ON GUNS WOULD
 BE QUICKLY APPEALED BY MANY
 SECOND AMENDMENT ADVOCATES.
 IT GOES TO SHOW THERE ARE SO
 MUCH IN FRONT DON'T LIKE
 MISINFORMATION WITH FIREARMS,
 MORE SO EVEN THE STUDENT LOANS.
 MOST OF THE DEATHS ARE HANDGUNS
 IN URBAN AREAS WITH GANG-RELATED
 VIOLENCE.
 I DID NOT HEAR ONES IN HER
 CAMPAIGN SPEECH THE LAST COUPLE
 WEEKS TALKING ABOUT THE SYSTEMIC
 ISSUES, WHITE GANG VIOLENCE IS
 HAPPENING.
 TWO REASONS -PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN
 FATHERLESS HOUSES.
 THEY ARE TAKING LAW-ABIDING
 WEAPONS AWAY FROM AMERICANS
 THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
 TO SOLVE THE ISSUE.

 ON.

 A MAJOR TEST FOR THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THE
 SUPREME COURT TODAY, WHEN THE
 JUDGES HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER
 WHETHER THE INITIATION CAN PUT A
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE 2020
 CENSUS.
 SUPPORTERS SAY IT WILL HELP
 ENFORCE VOTING RIGHTS AND HAS
 BEEN DONE ON THE PAST.
 CRITICS SAY IT'S A VEILED
 ATTEMPT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
 NONCITIZENS, DISCOURAGE THEM
 FROM PARTICIPATING, AND IT WAS D
 RESULT IN UNDERCOUNTING THE
 PUBLISHING.
 THEY SAY THIS QUESTION IS BASED
 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE
 THAT WILL IMPACT THE ENTIRE
 COUNTRY AND HURT THE
 REPRESENTATION OF MINORITIES.
 PREFEDERAL COURTS HAVE BLOCKED
 THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT FROM
 ADDING THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION.
 COURTS HAVE RULED THAT COMMERCE
 SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS VIOLATED
 FEDERAL LAW AND THE WAY HE WENT
 ABOUT TRYING TO INCLUDE THE
 QUESTION ON THE CENSUS.
 MELISSA, I WILL GO WITH YOU --
 WHAT DO YOU SEE HAS PROS AND
 CO
 Melissa: AKE THE
 POLITICS OUT OF IT -WHICH, YOU
 KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS HARD -IN
 THIS CASE I THINK IT REALLY
 COUNTS.
 HOW DO YOU GET THE BEST PICTURE
 OF WHO IS WHERE?
 I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
 TO THAT, BECAUSE YOU WANT THE
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IN
 THEIR
 BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAXPAYF
 FUNDING, WHO NEEDS WHAT, WHAT IR
 @■X■XHE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
 SO I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS REALLY
 RARE.
 AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T WANT
 TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM NOT
 RESPONDING TO THE CENSUS BECAUSE
 THEY ARE AFRAID AND THEY ARE
 HERE ILLEGALLY.
 BECAUSE I WANT AN ACCURATE
 COUNT.
 SO I DON'T KNOW, BETWEEN THOSE
 TWO STATES, WHAT THE BEST WAYS
 TO GET AN ACCURATE COUNT.
 Katie: BUT THERE IS NO
 DISTINCTION IF YOU ARE HERE
 ILLEGALLY OR A CITIZEN ON THE
 CENSUS NOW.
 SO IT'S NOT DETERMINED.
 WE STILL DON'T HAVE AN ACCURATE
 COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL
 IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY.
 THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS OF THE
 CENSUS IS USED TO DELEGATE
 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AND IT'S
 RIDICULOUS THAT WE ARE COUNTING
 NONCITIZENS OR ILLEGAL ALIENS IN

 Jillian: SORRY TO INTERRUPT
 YOU, KATIE.
 WE HAVE A FOX NEWS ALERT.
 Melissa: FOX NEWS ALERT, WE
 CAN ALL CONFIRM THE
 VICE PRESIDENT                FR
 VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS
 GOING TO ANNOUNCE HIS
 RESIDENTIAL RUN ON THURSDAY.
 WE HAD BEEN HEARING IT WOULD
 HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY IN
 CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA.
 IT HAD BEEN SLATED, WE HAD
 THOUGHT, RUMORED FOR OTHER
 TIMES, AS WELL.
 THIS, HE'S GOING EFFICIENTLY
 ANNOUNCE HIS RUN ON THE
 THURSDAY.
 OH, BY A VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENT IS
 WHAT BE HER HEARING.
 HE WILL DO IT BY VIDEO.
 A LOT OF DETAILS CHANGING WE
 COME OUT.
 LET ME BRING ITTO THE COUCHm>
 ■>m>m>
 CHARLIE, WHAT DO
 THE FACT THAT HE IS GOI
 WE ARE HEARING THE LATEST --
 THAT HE'S GOING TO DO A VIDEO
 MESSAGE?
 AND THE DATA HAS CHANGED AGAIN,
 BUT NOW IT SEEMS TO BE FIRM.
 Charlie: AND NOT TOO SURE
 ABOUT THE VIDEO ASPECT.
 IT'S INTERESTING, YOU THINK YOU
 WOULD WANT THE BIGGEST CROWD
 POSSIBLE.
 MAYBE THEY HAVE TROUBLE BUILDING
 THE SAME CAR THAT KAMALA HARRIS
 WOULD BUILD.
 BY THE WAY, SHE HAD AN AMAZING,
 CALIFORNIA.
 MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE
 QUESTION TO BE THAT HE CAN'T
 BUILD A CROWD.
 I WILL SAY THIS -IT WILL GET
 VERY NASTY VERY QUICKLY.
 HE WILL COME IN WITH A LOT OF
 MONEY AND ADDRESSES AND MEDIA
 CONNECTIONS.
 THEY WILL LOOK AT HIM AS THE
 SINGULAR BULL'S-EYE THE SAME WAY
 THE CANDIDATES LOOKED AT
 JEB BUSH IN 2016.
 Melissa: WE ARE ALSO
 CONFIRMING HE WILL MAKE AN
 APPEARANCE ON MONDAY IN PERSON
 AS A CANDIDATE IN PITTSBURGH.
 VIDEO ON THURSDAY TO MAKE THE
 OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT, AND THEN
 THE MONDAY AS A CANDIDATE IN
 PERSON IN PITTSBURGH.
 WHY DO YOU THINK THE C■
  HEARD BEFORE OR DO■
 WERE FLOATED AND THEY WERE NEXT
 AND NOT FIRM?
 Leslie: I THINK THEY HAD
 FIRM PLANTS A DISH TO DO
 CHARLOTTESVILLE AND PITTSBURGH
 AND PHILLY ON WEDNESDAY,
 TOMORROW.
 IT WAS SMART FOR THEM.
 IT WOULD BE VIEWED AS
 DISRESPECTFUL.
 MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY SOURCES
 OVER THERE, THEY BASICALLY ARE
 SAYING, "LOOK, HE WANTS TO SAY
 THAT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
 RETURN OF THE HATE.
 TIRED OF THE DIVISION.
 I WANT TO UNITE AND BRING US
 TOGETHER.
 I WANT TO HELP THE FIX AND
 REPAIR THE WOUNDS."
 NOT A GOOD PLACE TO DO IT.
 PENNSYLVANIA, VERY SMART PLACE
 FOR THEM TO BE.
 NOT ONLY SEE FROM THERE,
 PENNSYLVANIA HAS ONE OF THE
 THREE STATES THAT HELPED PUT
 THEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE ALONG
 WITH WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN AND
 A STATE WHERE JOE BIDEN IS VERY
 POPULAR, A LOT OF BLUE COLORS
 WORKER BLUE-COLLAR
 WORKERS NOT VERY HAPPY. Melissa: DID THIS CHANGE IT
 SEEM?
 [LAUGHTER]
 Katie: THE ROLLOUT HAS BEEN
 CLUMSY.
 IT HURTS JOE BIDEN.
 YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING,
 BERNIE SANDERS HAS GAINED ON THE
 MEND IS THAT IF AND WHEN SOME OF
 THE EARLY STATES.
 IT'S A VERY EARLY, SO THAT CAN
 CHANGE.
 HOWEVER, I FIND IT INTERESTING
 THAT WE KEEP SAYING JOE BIDEN IS
 THE GUY WHO'S GOING TO BRING
 EVERYONE TOGETHER.
 GOING TO UNIFY EVERYBODY.
 JOE BIDEN IS THE GUY WHO IS VERY
 GOOD AT DIVISION THEN VERY GOOD
 AT STOKING THE FLAMES.
 VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES ON THE
 CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
 WAS A 2016 HE SAID REPUBLICANS
 WOULD PUT EVERYONE BACK IN
 CHAINS WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING --
 MITT ROMNEY, 2012?
 WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING TO AN
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUDIENCE.
 HE HAS SAID SOME PRETTY VILE
 THINGS THAT HE TENDS TO GET AWAY
 WITH BECAUSE HE'S NOT
 DONALD TRU
 Jillian: I KIND OF AGREE
 WITH WHAT YOU SAID, LESLIE,
 ABOUT HOW IT MAY NOT HAVE
 BEEN -AND IS NOT GOING TO
 HAPPEN NOW -THE BEST BET TO DO
 IT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE PAID EVER
 BUT HE AGREES, IF YOU WERE GOING
 TO DO IT SOMEWHERE,
 PENNSYLVANIA, SCRANTON,
 PHILADELPHIA EVEN.
 THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A BETTER MOVE
 SO IT FEELS LIKE THEY ARE
 PLAYING THE SAFE CARD AND DOING
 Leslie: CAN IMAGINE THE
 POLLS CUSTOMER TO YOUR POINT
 ABOUT THE POLL, THERE WAS A
 MORNING CONSUL POLE THAT SHOWED
 HIM LEADING
 BY 30%. THAT IS OVER SANDERS BY 6%.
 TEN DAYS AGO JOE BIDEN WAS
 LEADING.
 I DON'T THINK THAT JOE BIDEN
 LOST HALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS IN
 TEN DAYS.
 I'M JUST SAYING, I DON'T BELIEVE
 ALL THESE POLLS.
 Katie: THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
 WRONG BEFORE!
 [LAUGHTER]
 Leslie: SHOCKING!
 Jillian: WE WILL CERTAINLY
 KEEP AN EYE ON
 JOE BIDEN SUCH JUMP INTO THE
 PRESIDENTIAL RING AND SOME NEW
 POLLING -THAT WE LOVE -WITH
 SOME VERY INTERESTING NEWS FOR
 HIM.
 WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAYING
 ABOUT HIM AND BERNIE SANDERS
 WHEN WE
 COME BACK.

            and I do.
  <i> Be  Listen to ■.e■ your docton</i>
     <i> Take it seriously.</i>
 Jillian: A FOX NEWS ALERT, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL
 MAKE HIS CANDIDACY OFFICIAL ON
 THURSDAY, THIS IS NEW
 POLLING SHOWS THAT THE YOUNG
 DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE FEELING
 THE BURN FOR BERNIE SANDERS.
 THAT'S ACCORDING TO A NEW
 NATIONAL POLL LOOKS AT
 LIKELY PRIMARY VOTERS BETWEEN
 THE AGES OF 18 AND 29.
 IT SHOWS THAT
 SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS WITH A
 LEAD OVER FORMER VICE PRESIDENT
 JOE BIDEN WITH FORMER
 CONGRESSMAN BETO O'ROURKE
 TRAILING IN THIRD PLACE.
 THE POLL ALSO FINDS SHARP
 CHANGES IN SUPPORT BASED ON
 CATEGORIES LIKE GENDER.
 YOUNG MEN GIVING SANDERS THE
 EDGE OVER BIDEN, BUT SANDERS'
 LEAD NARROWS CONSIDERABLY AMONG
 YOUNG WOMEN.
 I WILL START WITH YOU.
 WHY DO YOU THINK THE YOUNGER
 GENERATION LOVES BERNIE SANDERS?
 Leslie: HE STARTED A
 REVOLUTION.
 IF YOU REMEMBER, WHEN HE RAN
 AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, HE
 WASN'T JUST A CANDIDATE.
 IT WAS A REVOLUTION.
 YOUNG PEOPLE OF THAT.
 PROTESTS, TO REVOLT ABOUT
 SOMETHING.
 IN ADDITION, HE PROMISES FREE
 STUFF.
 FREE HEALTH CARE, FREE TUITION.
 HAVING TROUBLE PAYING THE
 STUDENT LOANS?
 IF YOU HAVE TO DO A SECOND JOB
 OR GET A MINIMUM WAGE JOB, I'M
 GOING TO FIGHT FOR $15 AN HOUR."
 THEY LIKE THAT.
 IT RESONATES WITH THEM.
 WHAT ALSO RESONATES IS THAT HE
 HAS PORTRAYED HIMSELF AS A
 CHAMPION OF THE OPPRESSED AND
 THEY TRULY FEEL OPPRESSED.
 Jillian: BUT THIS MESSAGE
 HASN'T WORKED IN THE PAST.
 HE TRIED TO COME AND GO TO YOU.
 PART OF WHAT I THINK IS GOING
 ON -A LITTLE BIT, ANYWAY -IS
 GETTING THE MESSAGING OUT.
 YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE
 ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, HE
 DOES SO MUCH ON SOCIAL MEDIA,
 YOU HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LISTEN
 TO OUR MESSAGE.
 YOU FEEL THAT SOMEONE LIKE HER
 IS HELPING HIM IN THIS MOVEMENT?
 Charlie: YOU ARE.
 I AGREE WITH WHAT HE SAID.
 SOME VILLANELLES DO FEEL
 OPPRESSED.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
 YOU LIVE IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY
 IN THE WORLD WITH MORE
 OPPORTUNITY THAN EVER BEFORE.
 LIFE
      EXPECTANCY EXPANDING, WHICH IS GOING UP, YOUTH AND IMPLEMENT
 LOWER THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN.
 MORE JOB OPENINGS THAN PEOPLE TO
 FILL THOSE JOBS.
 WHICH ARE THEY FEEL OPPRESSED
 ABOUT?
 THAT THERE UBER EATS WAS LATER
 THERE WAS A LONG LINE AT
 STARBUCKS?
 [LAUGHTER]
 HE FOCUSES ON TWO THINGS -HE
 PROMISES AN UNATTAINABLE UTOPIA,
 AND NUMBER TO BECOME A PLAYS
 INTO THIS VICTIMHOOD CULTURE
 THAT THE UNIVERSITIES TRAIN
 ENTS TO PROGRAMMATICALLY
 FOCUS ON.
 HEONVINCES THEM THAT EVERYONE
 IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS
 DESERVING OF EVERYTHING FROM
 BEFORE THEM.
 THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST
 YOU, THEREFORE ITS ABILITY AND
 OUR MONEY THAT YOU DESERVE.
 IT'S TENDER STUFF.
 Katie: HE'S ALSO BLIND T
 YOUNG PEOPLE.
 WHEN HE PROMISES FREE
 HERE IS NO SUCH
 THING AS FREE.
 SOMEONE WILL PAY FOR IT.
 IF YOU DO THE MATH ON HIS
 PROPOSALS, WHETHER IT'S FREE
 COLLEGE OR FREE MEDICAL CARE,
 YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TAX
 EVERYBODY.
 WHICH HE ADMITS.
 "ALL OF YOUR TAXES WILL GO UP
 BUT THEN YOU WILL HAVE FREE
 SERVICES," WHICH ALSO WASN'T
 TRUE.
 WE SOME REPORTS OF MEDICARE AND
 SOCIAL SECURITY GOING INSOLVENT.
 THOSE AREN'T WORKING AND HE
 CONTINUES TO LIE TO THEM ABOUT
 IT.
 HE'S A HYPOCRITE.
 LAST NIGHT DURING HIS CNN
 TOWN HALL HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE
 TERM TAX CUTS AND HE RAILED
 AGAINST THEM EVEN THOUGH HE GOT
 A TAX CUT AND ISN'T WILLING TO
 WRITE A CHECK FOR THE DIFFERENCE
 OF THE GOVERNMENT.
 Jillian: MELISSA, I'M
 CURIOUS -PEOPLE ARE RALLYING
 BEHIND HIM AND HIS METHOD RIGHT
 NOW.
 ULTIMATELY DO THINK THEY VOTE
 FOR HIM?
 Melissa: THAT'S A VERY
 INTERESTING QUESTION.
 I LIKE THIS POLL, IT'S FROM THE
 INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AT THE
 KENNEDY SCHOOL AT HARVARD.
 THEY WELCOMED ME AS A SPEAKER
 AND THEY HAD ME THERE WITH
 ANOTHER DEMOCRAT WHO WARNED ME
 BEFORE I WENT OUT AND SAID,
 "THESE KIDS ARE SO LIBERAL, THEY
 SHOCK EVEN DEMOCRATS."
 EVERYONE WHO COMES TALK TO THEM,
 THEIR FRUIT IS LEFT OF ANYTHING
 THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE
 BE READY." THEY HAD VERY INTERESTING
 QUESTIONS BUT IT WOULDN'T
 SURPRISE ME AT ALL THAT THEY
 WOULD LET WHOEVER THE FARTHEST
 LEFT CANDIDATE IS.
 I LOVE THE IOP!
 GO, GUYS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Charlie: THE FINAL POINT I
 WILL MAKE IS THAT IT'S VERY EASY
 TO BE GENEROUS WITH OTHER
 PEOPLE'S MONEY.
 IT'S EASY TO HAVE --
 Leslie: BUT HE HAS SAID
 HE'S A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST.
 Katie: MAYBE HE SHOULD PAY
 WITH HIS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
 MAYBE HE WILL AN OUT HOUSE TO
 MILLENNIUM.
 Charlie: IF THE GOVERNMENT
 IS THE BEST WAY TO RIGHT THE
 WRONGS OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM,
 YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE ANY MONEY TO
 CHARITY.
 TO GOVERNMENT.
 HE SHOULD NOT GIVE CHARITABLE
 CONTRIBUTIONS.
 JUST GIVE IT TO THE IRS.
 Katie: HE SHOULDN'T SELL
 HIS BOOK ON BARNES & NOBLE OR
 AMAZON, EITHER.
 SPEED WENT ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
 WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AFTER THE
 BREAK.
 IN THE MEANTIME, FOX NEWS IS NOW
 SET TO HOST ANOTHER BIG
 TOWN HALL EVENT.
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT CANDIDATE
 MARY PETE BUTTIGIEG WILL SIT
 DOWN WITH OUR OWN CHRIS WALLACE
 IN THE EARLY VOTING STATE OF
 NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 YOU CAN CATCH IT ON SUNDAY,
 MAY 19TH, AT 7:00 P.M. EASTERN.
 RIGHT HERE ON    ON FOX NEWS CH.
 ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO WATCH
 THAT.
 A LEGAL BATTLE IS BREWING
 BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
 HOUSE OVERSIGHT CHAIRMAN
 ELIJAH CUMMINGS OVER THE
 PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL FINANCIAL
 RECORD.
 IS THIS LEGITIMATE OVERSIGHT OR
 HAVE DEMOCRATS GONE TOO FAR?
 THAT'S.
 THEY TRY THESE TYPE OF
 RIDICULOUS TACTICS IN THE PAST
 TO PUSH THINGS LIKE TAX RETURNS.
 IT'S ALREADY BEEN LITIGATED IN
 THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION AND
 IN THE ELECTION THE PRESIDENT
 WON FAIRLY AND SQUARELY.
 HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND NO ONE
 CARES ABOUT RIDICULOUS CHARGES
 ABOUT TAX RETURNS.

 CHAIRMAN ELIJAH CUMMINGS
 RESPONDING TO THE LAWSUIT FILED
 AGAINST HIM BENT TRUMP
 AND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION
 YESTERDAY.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYERS MOVING
 TO BLOCK SUBPOENAS FOR FINANCIAL
 INFORMATION FROM THE PRESIDENT'S
 BUSINESSES.
 CHAIRMAN CUMMINGS RESPONDING,
 "THE PRESIDENT HAS A LONG
 HISTORY OF TRYING TO USE
 BASELESS LAWSUITS TO ATTACK HIS
 ADVERSARIES, BUT THERE IS SIMPLY
 NO VALID LEGAL BASIS TO
 INTERFERE WITH THIS DULY
 AUTHORIZED SUBPOENA FROM
 CONGRESS."
 THE SUIT ASKED THE FEDERAL COURT
 IN WASHINGTON TO KEEP CHAIRMAN
 COMING CUMMINGS FROM OBTAINING
 RECORDS FROM THE ACCOUNTING FIRM
 THE PRESIDENT AND HIS BUSINESSES
 USE.
 JAY SEKULOW, COUNSEL TO THE
 PRESENT, SING THIS IN A
 STATEMENT -"WILL NOT ALLOW
 CONGRESSIONAL PRESIDENTIAL
 HARASSMENT TO GO UNANSWERED
 TO."
 CHARLIE?
 Charlie: WHAT'S HAPPENING
 IS THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO
 ASSEMBLE THE GREATEST
 TAXPAYER-FUNDED OPPOSITION
 RESEARCH FILE ON DONALD TRUMP
 THEY POSSIBLY CAN.
 THAT'S ALL THIS IS.
 THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED BY THE
 MUELLER REPORT'S OF THE STAR TO
 REPOSITION ALL OF THEIR
 STRATEGIES A COUPLE MONTHS AGO
 WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO LEAVE
 MILLER'S TEAM, STARTED TO SIGNAL
 THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THIS
 BOMBSHELL.
 I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THIS -FOR
 THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE HAVE
 HEARD■@■■=>
 NANCY PELOSI ESSAY AMAZING
 THINGS ABOUT BOB MUELLER.
 THAT THIS MUELLER REPORT WITH
 THE END OF THE PRESIDENCY,
 MUELLER IS COMING.
 ANOTHER POINT IS OUT AND THEY
 WANT MORE INFORMATION.
 THIS GOES TO SHOW THEY ARE MUCH
 MORE FOCUSED ON DESTABILIZING
 THE PRESIDENCY OF DONALD TRUMP
 THAN ACTUALLY DOING WHAT'S BEST
 FOR AMERICA.
 Katie: LESLIE,
 PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ELECTED THE
 FIRST TIME WITHOUT RELEASING HIS
 TAX RETURNS.
 DOES IT REALLY MATTER AT THIS
 POINT?
 FIVE THERE ARE COUPLE THINGS.
 TO YOUR POINT, I WOULD DISAGREE.
 SINCE HE'S BEEN CAMPAIGNING THEY
 HAVE GONE AFTER HIS TAX RETURNS
 BEFORE HE EVEN HEARD THE NAME
 BOB MUELLER.
 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DEMOCRATS
 WANT.
 ONE OF THE REASONS THEY WANT IT
 IS IF YOU ARE ASKED FOR
 SOMETHING VIA A SABINA AND HE
 PUSHED BACK, WHAT
 IT'S LIKE, "O.J., WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY IN THE CAR?
 HE MUST BE GUILTY AND HIDING
 SOMETHING."
 I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY FEEL.
 THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE VIEW, IF
 YOU'RE GOING TO DO AN
 INVESTIGATION AND YOU'RE GOING
 TO FOLLOW A MONEY TRAIL, YOU
 NEED TO SEE ALL THE MONEY THAT
 HAS BEEN REPORTED AND HAS BEEN
 RECEIVED.
 INCLUDING BISE BUSINESS.
 Melissa: COME ON, LET'S BE
 HONEST.
 THEY WANT TO LOOK AT IT TO SEE
 WHAT THEY CAN FIND IN THERE TO
 HURT HIM IN THE NEXT ELECTION.
 IT WAS A RISK TO SAY THAT YOU
 WEREN'T GOING TO PUT YOUR TAX
 RETURNS BEFORE YOU WERE ELECTED,
 BECAUSE THEN, YES, VOTERS COULD
 SAY MAYBE HE'S HIDING SOMETHING
 WE SHOULD SEE.
 HE TOOK THAT RISK, HE DIDN'T PUT
 THEM OUT, AND HE WON.
 THAT'S THAT.
 AND OF THE STORY.
 NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO IT NOW.
 THEY DIDN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO IT
 BEFORE.
 YOU COULD HOLD IT AGAINST
 MASSIVE VOTER AND YOU STILL HAVE
 THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT.
 HE'S NOT RELEASING THEM AGAIN,
 SO VOTERS WILL ONCE AGAIN HAVE
 THE OPPORTUNITY, IF THEY CHOOSE,
 TO HOLD IT AGAINST THEM.
 THEY DID LAST TIME, WE WILL SEE.
 MAYBE IT'S DIFFERENT NOW.
 Jillian: JUST BECAUSE
 YOU'RE SAYING NO TO RELEASE
 SOMETHING, DOESN'T NECESSARILY
 MEAN -I GET WHAT YOU'RE
 SAYING, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
 YOU'RE GUILTY OR THAT THERE IS
 SOMETHING TO FIND.
 IT JUST MEANS NO.
 Leslie: EVERY DEMOCRAT AND
 REPUBLICAN WHO HAS RUN -EVEN
 IN LOCAL OFFICES -SHARES THEIR
 TAX RETURNS.
 Melissa: BECAUSE THEY FELT
 COMPELLED TO DO IT.
 THAT'S WHAT MADE IT SUCH A HUGE
 RISK THAT HE DIDN'T DO IT.
 THAT'S WHAT MADE IT■dH A RISK.
 Leslie: BUT WHAT IS THE
 MOTIVATION FOR NOT DOING IT?
 Melissa: BECAUSE HE KNOWS
 IT'S A HUGE DOCUMENT.
 ANYONE WHO DOES REAL ESTATE IN
 NEW YORK, IT'S A HUGE DOCUMENT.
 ■÷■÷w÷w÷w÷■÷w÷■÷w÷w÷w÷ THROUGH D
 FIND SOMETHING.
 Katie: IT WILL BE USED AS A
 POLITICAL WEAPON.
 Melissa: NOT ILLEGAL
 THING.
 Charlie: SOMETHING THAT'S
 NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH -WHAT
 A GIFT TO HIS COMPETITORS, ALL
 TH■■■■NS, WHO WANT TO
 SEE THE IN-DEPTH FINANCIALS OF
 ALL HIS ASSETS.
 HE'S TRYING TO PRESERVE A
 BUSINESS ENTERPRISE THAT HE HAS
 SPENT DECADES AND LOTS OF RISK
 PUTTING TOGETHER.
 IF HE WANTS THE NEXT GENERATIONS
 TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT.
 WHY WOULD HE GIVE HIS FINANCIALS
 TO THE HILTONS, THE MARRIOTTS,
 TO ALL THE OTHER COMPETITORS
 THEY CAN IN-DEPTH LOOK?
 HE SHOULDN'T GIVE THOSE
 FINANCIALS.
 BY THE WAY, I WILL DEFEND THAT
 HE HAS A RIGHT TO PROTECT IT.
 Leslie: HE DIDN'T GET INTO
 DEL MIKE VOTED INTO OFFICE TO
 PROTECT HOTELS AND WALL STREET.
 Charlie: BUT HE HAS A RIGHT
 TO KEEP THEM PRIVATE.
 Melissa: VOTERS KNOW THAT.
 VOTERS ARE SAYING, "YOU DON'T

           Hi Dad. No.       Don't try to get up.
        Hi, I'm Julie, a     Right at Home caregiver.
     And if I'd been caring          for Tom's dad,
       I would have noticed       some dizziness that
  could lead to balance issues.
  That's because I'm trained to report any changes in behavior,
   no matter how small, so Tom    could have peace of mind.
      We'll be right there.
          We have to go.
            Hey, Tom.  You should try Right at Home.
      They're great for us.
 The Right Care. Right at Home.
