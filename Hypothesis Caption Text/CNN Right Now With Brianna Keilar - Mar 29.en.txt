 THERE'S NO MIDDLE GROUND ON THIS ONE.
 ALSO JUST A QUICK REMINDER,
 THE PRESIDENT CAN'T AUTHORIZE
 SPENDING.
 A BUDGET PROPOSAL IS DEAD ON
 ARRIVAL AND ASPIRATIONAL.
 THAT'S WHAT THE APPROPRIATIONS
 COMMITTEE DID, SO HE DIDN'T SAY
 OKAY ON THE SPENDING, HE JUST
 CHANGED HIS MIND ON THE BUDGET
 DETAIL.
 THANKS FOR JOINING US ON
 "INSIDE POLITICS."
 WE'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE SUNDAY
 AT8:00 A.M.
 BRIANNA KEILAR STARTS RIGHT NOW.
 I'M BRIANNA KEILAR LIVE FROM
 CNN'S WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS.

 AND EVEN PROFANE ATTACK ON■  FI7
 NOT JUST THE FOUR-PAGE SUMMARY
 WITH VERY SMALL QUOTES FROM THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 OUR KAITLAN COLLINS IS AT THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM THE
 PRESIDENT, KAITLAN?
 Reporter: IT WAS■F■F■F■F■F■F
 THE 2016 CAMPAIG ENDED, BUT HE
 DIDN'T JUST VINDICATE HIMSELF IN
 THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, HE
 ALSO SAID IT WAS ONE FOR HIS
 SUPPORTERS AS WELL, ANDRAMED
 THE PEOPLE INVESTIGATING THE
 PRESIDENT IN HIS CAMPAIGN■■■■ W
 APART THE COUNTRY.
 THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T SAVE■■■■■■
 TOUGHEST LANGUAGE FOR THEM BUT
 ALSO FOR D■■■WELL.
 THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO DELIGHT
 THIS TAKING A VICTORY LAP AROUND
 THEM.
 AFTER THREE YEARS OF LIES AND
 SMEARS AND SLANDER, THE RUSSIA
 HOAX IS FINALLY DEAD.
 TOTAL EXONERATION, COMPLETE
 VINDICATION.
 THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO NOW DECIDE
 WHETHER THEY WILL CONTINUE
 DEFRAUDING THE PUBLIC WITH
 RIDICULOUS [ BLEEP ].
 ROBERT MUELLER WAS A GOD TO THE
 DEMOCRATS.
 THEY DON'T LIKE HIM SO MUCH
 RIGHT NOW.
 Reporter: NOW, HE DIDN'T JUS
 REFERENCE DEMOCRATS GENERALLY.
 HE WENT AFTER THE CHAIRMAN OF
 THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE, ADAM SCHIFF
 SPECIFICALLY, SEVERAL TIMES
 MOCKING HIM THROUGHOUT THE
 NIGHT.HEARD THIDENT THERE
 SOME■F, AND IT REALLY
 ILLUMINATED THE ANGER HE FELT
 THERE IN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES OR
 SO OF THAT SPEECH.
 BUT THEN THE PRESIDENT WENT ON
 AND STARTED SPEAKING, AND IT
 STARTED TO SOUND LIKE HIS PAST
 RALLIES AND MADE PEOPLE AT THE
 WHITE HOUSE I SPOKE TO WONDER IF
 THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MISS
 HAVING THIS FIGHT OF THE RUSSIA
 INVESTIGATION.
 WE'LL E.
 KAITLAN COLLINS, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR US.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RAILING
 RIGHT NOW ON IMMIGRATION,
 THREATENING TO SHUT DOWN THE
 SOUTHERN BORDER.
 IN A SERIES OF TWEETS, THE
 PRESIDENT SAYS IF MEXICO DOESN'T
 IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL ILLEGAL
 IMMIGRATION COMING INTO THE
 UNITED STATES THROUGH OUR
 SOUTHERN BORDER, I WILL BE
 CLOSING THE BORDER OR LARGE
 SECTIONS OF THE BORDER NEXT
 WEEK.
 OUR ED LAVENDARA IS JOINING ME
 ON THE PHONE.
 ED, THIS IS A PRETTY DIRE THREAT
 FROM THE PRESIDENT.
 TELL ME WHAT CLOSING THE BORDER
 WOULD DO WHERE YOU ARE?
 Reporter: IS HE TALKING ABOUT
 ESSENTIALLY TALKING ABOUT
 CLOSING EVERY BRIDGE, EVERY PORT
 OF ENTRY, NOT ALLOWING ANY
 COMMERCE OR TRUCKS TO COME BACK
 AND FORTH THROUGH THE BORDER,
 NOT TO MENTION THE MILLIONS OF
 PEOPLE WHO CROSS THE BORDER
 EVERY DAY AS PART OF EVERYDAY
 LIFE ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER?
 THE DETAILS OF EXACTLY HOW THIS
 WOULD PLAY OUT WOULD DICTATE A
 LOT OF HOW THIS WOULD LOOK.
 BUT OVERALL, THE IDEA OF CLOSING
 DOWN THE BORDER, I'T
 OV■pJUST HOWHOCKING■■■■TULD BE
 IN THE BORDER RN IN THE
 SOUTHERN UNITED STATES, AND WHAT
 THAT WOULD MEAN ECONOMICALLY,
 NOT JUST FOR THE SOUTHERN BORDER
 REGIONS, BUT FOR THE REST OF THE
 COUNTRY.
 IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE, AGAIN,
 JUST WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THAT
 WOULD HAVE ON THE U.S. ECONOMY
 WHEN YOU THINK OF THE TENS■■S■
 THOUSANDS OF TRUCKS THAT MOVE
 GOODS AND SERVICES BACK AND
 FORTH ACROSS THE BORDER FROM
 BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS ALL THE WAY
 TO SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.
 THAT WOULD BE A SHOCKING AND
 STUNNING DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN
 ALONG THE U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER.
 INDEED.
 ED LAVENDARA, THANK YOU SO MUCH
 FOR THAT, TALKING TO US FROM
 BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS.
 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE
 PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF FOUR OR
 FIVE SENATE REPUBLICANS TO COME
 UP WITH A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO
 OBAMACARE.
 WE HAVE JEREMY DIAMOND JOINING
 US WITH THE DETAILS.
 IS THIS THE CASE, JEREMY?
 IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T APPEAR
 TO BE AT THIS POINT, BRIANNA.
 WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT TALKED
 YESTERDAY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE
 REPUBLICAN SENATORS HE WAS
 PUTTING TOGETHER TO TRY AND
 ADVANCE THIS ISSUE, TRY AND GET
 SOME KIND OF REPLACEMENT FOR
 OBAMACARE IF INDEED THIS RULING
 STRIKING DOWN THE ENTIRETY OF
 THE HEALTH CARE LAW IS INDEED
 UPHELD.
 BUT WE SPOKE WITH SEVERAL
 SOURCES ON CAPITOL HILL AND THE
 WHITE HOUSE, AND IT DOES NOT
 APPEAR SUCH A WORKING GROUP DOES
 EXIST IN SUCH FORM OR FASHION.
 THE NAMES WE CHECKED BEHIND THIS
 SAID THEIR OFFICE DIDN'T MENTION
 THE EXISTENCE OF ANY KIND OF
 WORKING GROUP.
 WHAT THEY SAID WAS THOSE
 SENATORS, BILL CASSIDY, RICK
 SCOTT, FOR EXAMPLE, JOHN VERASO,
 THEY ARE INDEED CONTINUING TO
 HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HEALTH
 CARE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WITH
 THEIR COLLEAGUES.
 ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR TOLD ME
 SPECIFICALLY THAT IT APPEARS
 THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SIMPLY
 TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS HE HAS
 TALKED TO ABOUT HEALTH CARE.
 BUT AS FAR AS THE EXISTENCE OF
 AN ACTUAL WORKING GROUP TO COME
 UP WITH A REPLACEMENT, IT
 DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT IS THE
 CASE.
 AND THAT IS WHERE WE FIND THIS
 ADMINISTRATION, PUSHING THIS
 POSITION TO FULLY INVALIDATE
 OBAMACARE THROUGH THE COURTS
 WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING ANY KIND
 OF A REPLACEMENT READY TO GO.
 BRIANNA?
 JEREMY DIAMOND, THANK YOU FOR
 THAT FACT CHECK THERE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOW
 TAKING CREDIT FOR SAVING THE
 SPECIAL OLYMPICS FROM A CRISIS
 THAT WAS CREATED BY HIS OWN
 ADMINISTRATION.
 EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY DeVOS
 HAS BEEN SQUARING E ING OFF WIT
 CONGRESS ON HER BUDGET W
 CALLS FOR LIMITING FUNDS FOR
 SPECIAL OLYMPICS.
 HERE ARE PEOPLE QUESTIONING THE
 DECISION?
 ARE YOU QUESTIONING THE
 DECISION OF THE EDUCATION
 SECRETARY TO REMOVE SPECIAL
 OLYMPICS FUNDING?
 THAT IS ONE OF THE MORE ODD
 MOMENTS I HAVE SEEN.
 BUT AS THE PRESSURE MOUNTED
 TOWARD DeVOS, THE PRESIDENT
 STEPPED IN.
 I HAVE BEEN TO THE SPECIAL
 OLYMPICS.
 I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE.
 I JUST AUTHORIZED A FUNDING.
 I HEARD ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.
 I HAVE OVERRIDDEN MY PEOPLE.
 WE ARE FUNDING THE SPECIAL
 OLYMPICS.
 A.B.'S DAUGHTER IS HERE.
 THIS HAS BEEN A WATER COOLER
 KIND OF THING IN D.C. HERE ALL
 WEEK.
 WE SHOULD POINT THAT OUT.
 HE ALSO SAYS HE THINKS THE
 SPECIAL OLYMPICS ARE INCREDIBLE.
 HE DOESN'T HAVE SUCH A GOOD
 TRACK RECORD WHEN HE TALKED
 ABOUT ESPECIALLY THE
 PARALYMPICS.
 HE SAID THEY WERE HARD TO WATCH.
 SO HE LIKES TO COME IN AND BEING
 THE SAVIOR WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY
 THROWING BETSY DeVOS UNDER THE
 BUS OR ALLOWING HER TO SOMEHOW
 CHANGE HER MIND ON THIS.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT,
 BRIANNA, HE DIDN'T AUTHORIZE ANY
 FUNDING YESTERDAY FOR SPECIAL
 OLYMPICS.
 THE CONGRESS AUTHORIZE SPS
 SPENDING.
 IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET, THEY
 PROPOSED MAKING SOME CUTS IN
 THIS PROGRAM.
 THEY WOULD HAVE TO WRITE IT INTO
 THE FUNDING BILL, WHICH THEY
 DIDN'T.
 SO THE FACT HE TOLD US THAT HE
 OVERRODE HIS PEOPLE AND
 AUTHORIZED FUNDING IS ALSO
 FACTUALLY INCORRECT.
 REX TILLERSON, HIS FORMER
 SECRETARY OF STATE, HAD TO BE
 CALLED OUT ON TWITTER FOR ALL
 THE WORLD TO SEE ON INNORTH KORN
 POLICY.
 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS HAD TO
 EXPERIENCE THIS.
 MAKING IT CLEAR THAT HE IS THE
 FINAL DECIDER.
 IT'S NOT A TEAM EFFORT OVER
 THERE.
 IT WAS PAINFUL TO SEE BETSY
 DeVOS' REACTION AFTER THE
 PRESIDENT SAID HE OVERRODE THIS
 BECAUSE SHE WAS TRYING TO
 INDICATE SHE HAD BEEN FOR FULL
 FUNDING OF THIS ALL ALONG.
 THIS IS THE COST OF WORKING IN
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, NO
 QUESTION, AND I WAS FASCINATED
 TO SEE THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS
 ADMINISTRATION SECRETARY IS
 PLANNING TO STEP DOWN AND GO
 BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
 PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS A
 SHORT-TERM AND FRUSTRATING
 EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S WHY THERE
 IS SO MUCH TURNOVER IN THIS
 WHITE HOUSE.
 ARE WE GOING BACK TO JEREMY
 DIAMOND AT THE WHITE HOUSE?
 LET'S GO BACK TO JEREMY DIAMOND
 AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
 JEREMY, YOU HAVE SOME NEWS.
 TELL US.
 WE CAN NOW CONFIRM WITH A
 SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH HER PLANS
 THAT OLIVIA McMANN, HEAD OF THE
 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,
 DOES PLAN TO LEAVE HER POSITION.
 SHE DOES PLAN TO RESIGN.
 WE'RE TOLD THAT RESIGNATION,
 THAT ANNOUNCEMENT, COULD COME AS
 EARLY AS TODAY.
 THAT IS JUST COMING THROUGH
 RIGHT NOW, BRIANNA.
 AS YOU KNOW, SHE IS ONE OF THE
 FEW WOMEN IN THE PRESIDENT'S
 CABINET.
 SHE'S ALSO ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST
 MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S
 CABINET.
 SHE WAS A FORMER WWE EXECUTIVE,
 IF YOU'LL REMEMBER.
 WE WERE TOLD SHE WAS GUNNING FOR
 A MORE SENIOR ROLE, AND THAT
 WOULD BE COMMERCE SECRETARY.
 BUT AS OF NOW IT APPEARS SHE'S
 RUNNING THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT
 IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY EXACTLY THAT
 IS OR WHAT IS PUSHING THIS
 DECISION.
 BUT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE LEARNING
 AT THIS HOUR, BRIANNA.
 WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING THIS.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE
 ADMINISTRATION, THAT LINDA
 McMANN IS LEAVING?
 IT'S VERY INTERESTING SHE
 MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN
 BECOMING COMMERCE SECRETARY.
 WILBUR ROSS HAS BEEN FACING
 QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS STOCK TRADES
 AND NUMEROUS THINGS, SO THERE
 WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT
 HE WAS ALSO MAYBE GOING TO BE
 SUMMARILY SHOOED OUT OR ASKED TO
 RESIGN.
 I THINK SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE,
 THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BACKLASH
 SHE HAS FACED IN HER POSITION.
 HE CERTAINLY HASN'T BEEN
 RESPECTFUL TO HER IN PUBLIC AS
 HE HAS JAMES MATTIS AND A LOT OF
 OTHER PEOPLE.
 AS I SAID, THIS IS A VOLATILE
 PLACE TO WORK.
 WE SEE TURNOVER LIKE WE HAVE
 NEVER SEEN IN AN EXECUTIVE
 BRANCH IN THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION BEFORE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP MOCKING
 ASYLUM ERS, CLAIMING MANY OF
 THEM ARE PROTESTING AS THERESA
 MAY'S BREXIT DEAL FAILS AGAIN.
 SOMELY FINDINGS FROM
 INVESTIGATORS IN THE CRASH OF
 THE SECOND JET.
  Choosing my car insurance was    the easiest decision ever.
      I switched to GEICO and          saved hundreds.
           That's a win.
       But it's not the only        reason I switched.
  GEICO's a company I can trust,
    with over 75 years of great       savings and service.

       Now that's a win-win.
        <i> Switch to GEICO.</i>
         <i> It's a win-win.</i>
       <i> You wouldn't accept</i>        <i> an incomplete job</i>
 ■■■■W■■■■ñ■        <i> from any one else.</i>
          <i> Why accept it</i>     <i> from your allergy pills?</i>
         <i> Flonase relieves</i>       <i> your worst symptoms</i>
   <i> including nasal congestion,</i>
     <i> which most pills don't.</i>
    <i> Flonase helps block 6 key</i>     <i> inflammatory substances.</i>
    <i> Most pills only block one.</i>
 <i>Flonase.</i>
       <i> If your moderate to</i>    <i> severe ulcerative colitis</i>
       <i> or Crohn's symptoms</i>
      <i> are holding you back,</i>
   <i> and your current treatment</i>   <i> hasn't worked well enough</i>
  <i> it may be time for a change.</i>
 <i>Ask your doctor about ENTYVIO®,</i>
       <i> the only biologic</i>     <i> developed and approved</i>
    <i> just for UC and Crohn's.</i>
  <i> ENTYVIO® works at the site of</i>  <i> inflammation in the GI tract,</i>
        <i> and is clinically</i>       <i> proven to help many</i>
      <i> patients achieve both</i>  <i> symptom relief and remission.</i>
  <i> Infusion and serious allergic</i>      <i> reactions can happen</i>

          <i> ENTYVIO® may</i>   <i> increase risk of infection,</i>

 SO AS WE REPORTED EARLIER, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THREATENING
 TO SHUT DOWN THE SOUTHERN
 BORDER.
 HERE'S THE TWEET.
 IF MEXICO DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY
 STOP ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
 COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES AT
 OUR SOUTHERN BORDER, I WILL BE
 CLOSING THE BORDER OR LARGE
 SECTIONS OF THE BORDER NEXT
 WEEK.
 THESE ARE COMMENTS THAT COME AS
 THE PRESIDENT MOCKED ASYLUM
 SEEKERS IN MICHIGAN LAST NIGHT.
 YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL MET BY
 THE LAWYERS.
 THEY COME OUT, THEY'RE ALL MET
 BY THE LAWYERS, AND THEY SAY,
 SAY THE FOLLOWING PHRASE, I AM
 VERY AFRAID FOR MY LIFE.
 I AM AFRAID FOR MY LIFE.
 OKAY, AND THEN I LOOK AT THE
 GUY, HE LOOKS LIKE HE JUST GOT
 OUT OF THE RING, HE'S A
 HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE
 WORLD.
 IT'S A BIG FAT CON JOB, FOLKS.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE
 FAMILIES.
 THAT'S REALLY THE TREND THAT
 WE'RE SEEING.
 WE HAVE ROBERT PEREZ, THE DEPUTY
 COMMISSIONER IN CUSTOMS FOR
 BORDER PROTECTION TO TALK ABOUT
 THE STATE OF THINGS ON THE
 BORDER.
 THERE IS THIS THREAT TO SHUT
 DOWN PARTS OF THE BORDER.
 WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR THE
 CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL, BUT
 ALSO THE PRESIDENT IS CLEARLY
 TRYING TO PRESSURE MEXICO.
 WHAT IS THE CBP LOOKING FOR FOR
 SUPPORT FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF
 THE BORDER?
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME,
 BRIANNA.
 A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU.
 LOOK, WE ARE BEYOND THE BREAKING
 POINT.
 WE HAVE REACHED AN UNPRECEDENTED
 LEVEL WITH RESPECT TO THIS
 CRISIS SITUATION, THE AMOUNT OF
 UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS THAT ARE
 ARRIVING ALONG OUR SOUTHERN
 BORDER.
 WE HIT AN HISTORIC HIGH LAST
 MONTH WITH 67,000.
 WE PROJECT WE WILL REACH 100,000
 THIS MONTH.
 AND IT'S NOT JUST THE BORDER
 PATROL FRON THE FRONT LINE, BUT
 THE ENTIRE IMMIGRATION WAS NEVER
 DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THESE
 TYPES OF NUMBERS, AND THE
 DEMOGRAPHICS, WHICH IS REALLY
 IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND, IF I
 COULD SHARE WITH YOU, THE
 MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE
 COMING ARE FAMILY UNITS.
 MORE THAN HALF ARE FAMILY
 UNITS --
 65%, RIGHT?
 65%, EXACTLY, BRIANNA.
 IT HAS CLOGGED THE ENTIRE
 SYSTEM, OVERWHELMED IT.
 WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE OUR FRONT
 LINE MEN AND WOMEN ARE DOING AN
 EXCEPTIONAL JOB OVER AND ABOVE
 THE CALL OF DUTY IN DEALING WITH
 THIS UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS, BUT
 OUR FACILITIES, OUR LEGAL
 FRAMEWORK, OUR RESOURCING, OUR
 INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY,
 CAPACITY WAS NEVER DESIGNED OR
 BUILT FOR THIS.
 SO, YES, LOOK, WE NEED TO WORK
 WITH OUR MEXICAN COUNTERPARTS.
 THIS IS A REGIONAL ISSUE AND WE
 ALL NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
 DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN
 TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IF PARTS
 OF THE BORDER ARE TOTALLY SHUT
 DOWN?
 WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?
 WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS A
 PRETTY SEVERE CONSEQUENCE WITH
 RESPECT TO NOT ONLY THE ECONOMIC
 FLOWS.
 WE WELCOME ITS CUSTOMS AND
 BORDER PROTECTION AT OUR POINTS
 OF ENTRY.
 NEARLY 400 MILLION TRAVELERS A
 YEAR, $2 BILLION WORTH OF TRADE.
 NEARLY 3 MILLION TRUCKS, CARGO
 CONTAINERS EVERY YEAR.
 THERE IS A SEVERE IMPACT, AND
 WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND
 IS THAT THE CRISIS IS SO SEVERE
 RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LITERALLY
 TRYING TO SAVE LIVES.
 WE ARE FOCUSED ON SAVING THE
 LIVES OF CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR
 WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED, WHO
 ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY
 CRIMINAL HUMAN SMUGGLING
 ORGANIZATIONS AND GIVEN PROMISES
 ALONG WITH THESE VERY VULNERABLE
 POPULATIONS AND BEING BROUGHT
 INTO CONDITIONS THAT ARE FRANKLY
 JUST TOTALLY, TOTALLY
 INADEQUATE.
 YOUR COMMISSIONER GAVE A BIG
 SPEECH IN EL PASO THIS WEEK, AND
 HE SAYS ONLY ABOUT 10 OR 15% OF
 THE ASYLUM CLAIMS ARE CREDIBLE.
 THE ASYLUM GRANT RATE IS 25%,
 AND EVEN THAT DOESN'T REFLECT
 THE VIABILITY RATE.
 THERE ARE QUESTIONS OF HOW
 PEOPLE SEEKING ASYLUM, WHAT THEY
 WOULD GET.
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS,
 TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO
 MEET THIS BORDER REQUIREMENT.
 WHAT IS BORDER PROTECTION DOING
 TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE?
 WE ARE JUST IN THE FRONT END
 PART OF THAT PROCESS.
 THESE HUMAN SMUGGLING AND
 CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS, BY
 VIRTUE OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
 THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND
 SATURATING THE ENTIRETY OF THE
 SYSTEM WELL BEYOND BORDER AND
 PROTECTION VIOLATION, BY THE
 TIME THEY GET IN FRONT OF A
 JUDGE AND THEY FIND THEIR CLAIMS
 NOT TO BE CREDIBLE MAKES THOSE
 INDIVIDUAL ASYLUM SEEKERS LOST,
 IF YOU WILL, AND BEHIND SO MANY
 OF THESE OTHER CLAIMS THAT ARE
 BEING MADE.
 SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS
 GETTING TO THOSE LEGITIMATE
 ASYLUM SEEKERS --
 THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ASYLUM
 SEEKERS THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTED
 IN THAT NUMBER.
 I KNOW THE STATS SAY 20.
 THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ASYLUM
 SEEKERS NOT REPRESENTED IN THAT.
 THERE IS A QUESTION RIGHT NOW OF
 THERE MAY BE LEGITIMATE ASYLUM
 SEEKERS, THERE MAY BE NOT ENOUGH
 CAPACITY -- AND WE'RE SEEING
 THAT.
 WE SEE PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE A
 LEGITIMATE CLAIM BUT THEY'RE
 BEING DENIED.
 I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST
 THEY ARE NOT BEING DENIED.
 WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT,
 AGAIN, THE SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY
 SATURATED WITH MANY MORE FOLKS
 WHO, IN THE END OF THEIR ASYLUM
 PROCESS, WOULD BE FOUND NOT TO
 HAVE A VALID CLAIM, AND WE'RE
 DOING OUR BEST TO GET THOSE
 PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE
 AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO
 ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR LEGITIMATE
 CLAIMS.
 BUT NEVERTHELESS, AGAIN --
 SO WHAT DO YOU NEED, THEN?
 LONG TERM, SHORT TERM?
 YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN EL PASO IN AN
 UNDERPASS FENCED IN WITH BARBED
 WIRE.
 AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU'RE
 ABLE, CVP, TO PROVIDE WHAT IS
 UNDER THE LAW TO BE PROVIDED FOR
 THEM.
 WHAT DO YOU NEED IN THE SHORT
 TERM AND ALSO WHAT DO YOU NEED
 IN THE LONG TERM?
 BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM ISN'T GOING
 AWAY AND IT'S BEING FUELED BY
 VIOLENCE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
 SO WHAT WE NEED IS A
 COMPREHENSIVE AND REALLY A
 FULL-BLOWN PACKAGE OF RESOURCING
 BY WAY OF INFRASTRUCTURE,
 PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE,
 TECHNOLOGY, PERSONNEL ALONG THE
 BORDER TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH
 THE CRIMINAL FLOWS, THE DRUG
 FLOWS, THE NATIONAL SECURITY
 CONCERNS, AND ON THE
 HUMANITARIAN SIDE AS WELL, WE
 NEED THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO BE
 FIXED.
 WE NEED CONGRESS TO ACT.
 I MYSELF HAVE TESTIFIED UP ON
 CAPITOL HILL.
 WE'VE BEEN RINGING THIS BELL FOR
 MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS, NOW ABOUT
 CONGRESS' NEED TO FIX THE LEGAL
 FRAMEWORK, TO KEEP FAMILIES
 TOGETHER THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF
 THEIR ASYLUM CLAIMS AND ALSO BE
 ABLE TO RETURN, UNACCOMPANIED
 MINORS.
 THESE ARE THE GROUPS AND
 POPULATIONS, BRIANNA, THAT ARE
 BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND
 THEY'RE BEING BROUGHT UP AND
 SMUGGLED BY THESE CRIMINAL
 ORGANIZATIONS.
 THEY ARE BEING PUT IN A SYSTEM
 THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED.
 SO IT'S A LEGAL ISSUE AND A
 LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT WE NEED
 CONGRESS TO FIX FOR ALL OF US.
 CAN YOU SAY THAT CBD CAN
 PROVIDE WHAT IS NEEDED FOR THOSE
 FOLKS WHO ARE UNDER A BRIDGE IN
 EL PASO?
 BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
 SHELTER, FOOD AND WATER,
 ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE?
 CAN YOU COMMIT THAT YOUR
 ORGANIZATION IS PROVIDING THAT?
 I CAN NOT ONLY COMMIT BUT I
 CAN ALSO ASSURE YOU THAT, AS A
 PARENT MYSELF, AND OUR AGENTS
 AND OFFICERS WHO ARE MANY OF
 THEM PARENTS THEMSELVES, ARE
 DOING EVERYTHING THEY ABSOLUTELY
 CAN TO SAVE CHILDREN'S LIVES AND
 SAVE THE LIVES AND PROTECT THE
 WELL-BEING OF ALL THESE
 INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE
 POPULATIONS WE'RE ENCOUNTERING.
 OVER AND ABOVE THE CALL OF DUTY
 FOR THE LARGEST LAW ENFORCEMENT
 AGENCY IN THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT.
 ALL RIGHT, THERE HAVE BEEN
 SOME CHALLENGES.
 WE HAVE TO WRAP IT UP THERE.
 THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGES
 WITH THAT AND THAT MAY BE AN
 UNDERSTATEMENT.
 ROBERT PEREZ,HANK YOU FOR
  T/s AND TALKING
 WITH US.
 WE HAVE SOM MORE■O CLUES IN
 THE CRASH THAT KILLED EVERYONE
 ON THE PLANE.

           With moderate    to severe Crohn's disease,
       I was there, just not   always where I needed to be.
          Is she alright?
            I hope so.
     So I talked to my doctor           about HUMIRA.
  I learned HUMIRA is for people      who still have symptoms
        of Crohn's disease  after trying other medications.
         And the majority        of people on HUMIRA
  saw significant symptom relief    and many achieved remission
     in as little as 4 we
  <i> HUMIRA c■■■■T/%&</i>  saw significant symptom relief    and<i> &d infections,</i>remission

   <i> and nervous system problems,</i>   <i> serious allergic reactions,</i>
       <i> and new or worsening</i>          <i> heart failure.</i>
        <i> Before treatment,</i>        <i> get tested for TB.</i>
 x your doctor     <i> if you've been to areas</i>
 <i>where certain fungal infections</i>           <i> are common,</i>
      <i> and if you've had TB,</i>           <i> hepatitis B,</i>

        <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i>    <i> if you have an infection.</i>
    Be there for you, and them.
    Ask your gastroenterologist           about HUMIRA.
           With HUMIRA,      remission is possible.

      Wrong. Your insurance      company is gonna raise

         you coulda fixed          it with a pen.

     My digestive system used     to make me feel sluggish
         But now, I take       Metamucil every day.
     It traps and removes the    waste that weighs me down,
        So I feel lighter.
   Try Metamucil, and begin to  feel what lighter feels like.
     You're turning onto the             street
         when you barely       clip a passing car.
          Minor accident       —no big deal, right?
      Wrong. Your insurance      company is gonna raise
    your rate after the other    car got a scratch so small
         you ulda fixed          it with a pen.
    Maybe you should take that    pen and use it to sign up
         with a different        insurance company.

 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN THAT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN
 OBAMACARE.
 THE HEALTH CARE IS GOING VERY
 WELL.
 YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF
 PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, JUST
 REMEMBER THAT.
 ALWAYS PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
 BUT OBAMACARE IS TOO COSTLY FOR
 PEOPLE, THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND
 THE DEDUCTIBLE, WHICH AVERAGES
 MORE THAN $7,000, MEANING UNLESS
 SOMEBODY HAS GOT REALLY BIG
 PROBLEMS, CAN'T EVEN USE IT.
 OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER.
 RIGHT NOW IT'S LOSING IN COURT.
 RIGHT NOW IN THE TEXAS COURT, AS
 YOU KNOW, PROBABLY ENDS UP IN
 THE SUPREME COURT, BUT WE'RE
 DOING SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO
 BE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN
 OBAMACARE FOR THE PEOPLE.
 I'M NOT SAYING GOVERNMENT, I'M
 SAYING FOR THE PEOPLE.
 AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
 PREEXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE'LL
 HAVE A MUCH LOWER DEDUCTIBLE.
 AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT, THE
 REPUBLICANS ARE GOING UP
 BEING THE PARTY OF HEALTH CARE.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 THE PRESIDENT THERE IN
 FLORIDA WITH SOME DUBIOUS FACTS
 ALSO ABOUT OBAMACARE.
 THE PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN
 CLAIMING THAT A HEALTH CARE PLAN
 IS COMING AS HE ASKS THE COURTS
 TO END OBAMACARE.
 KEEP IN MIND A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS
 JUST BLOCKED ANOTHER ATTEMPT BY
 THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERMINE
 OBAMACARE.
 THEY WANT TO OFFER ALTERNATIVES
 TO HEALTH CARE EXCHANGES.
 WE HAVE BETTY LUJAN WITH US.
 YOU JUST PROPOSED A WIDE-RANGING
 LL WITH TWEAKS TO OBAMACARE.
 TELL US YOUR REACTION TO THE
 PRESIDENT SAYING THERE IS NO
 GREAT URGENCY IN CING UP WITH
 A NEW HEALTH CARE PLAN.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, AND
 IN TERMS OF WHERE I'M COMING
 FROM IN MY PART OF SOUTHEASTERN
 PENNSYLVANIA, ABOUT 300,000 OF
 US IN MY COMMUNITY WOULD END UP
 WITHOUT HEALTH CARE IF
 PREEXISTING CONDITIONS WEREN'T
 COVERED.
 AND FROM DAY TO DAY, HOUR TO
 HOUR, IN FACT, WITH OUR
 PRESIDENT, I'M NOT CERTAIN WHERE
 HE LANDS ON PREEXISTING
 CONDITION AND UNDERMINING THE
 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND WHAT
 ENDS UP HAPPENING IS A
 COMMUNITY, MY COMMUNITY, IS
 WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THEY WILL
 HAVE AFFORDABLE QUALITY,
 ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE, AND THE
 INDUSTRY ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH IT
 IS WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THE
 STABILIZATION WILL HAPPEN OR NOT
 HAPPEN.
 I THINK HE'S CREATING AN
 ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY
 WHICH ENDS WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE
 BEING WORRIED.
 YOU JUST HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT
 PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
 THEY'RE SAYING IT'S ALWAYS GOING
 TO BE COVERED.
 WE DO HEAR THIS CONSISTENTLY
 FROM REPUBLICANS AND FROM THE
 WHITE HOUSE, BUT DO YOU BELIEVE
 IT?
 I FRANKLY DON'T, BECAUSE I
 FEEL AS THOUGH PRETTY MUCH EVERY
 OTHER DAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
 BLOWING UP THE AFFORDABLE CARE
 ACT WHICH IS, IN FACT, A VEHICLE
 WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN THE NATION
 THAT IS PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH
 PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, AND SO I
 THINK THAT THIS IS A STEM
 ALBEIT FLAWED THAT DEFINITELY
 NEEDS TWEAKING, AS YOU
 MENTIONED.
 THAT IS THE SYSTEM OF OUR NATION
 RIGHT NOW.
 AND IF WE SHOULD BE WORKING AT
 THIS, WE SHOULD B WORKING TO
 FIX THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
 RATHER THAN BLOWING IT UP AND
 STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN.
 IF THE ADMINISTRATION
 SUCCEEDS IN DOING THAT, IN
 BLOWING THIS UP, SCRAPPING
 OBAMACARE ENTIRELY, WHAT WOULD
 IT TAKE FOR A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE,
 A REPUBLICAN SENATE AND THIS
 PRESIDENT TO FIND A HEALTH CARE
 LAW THAT THEY COULD AGREE ON?
 IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
 SO, YOU KNOW, I COME FROM A
 VERY PURPLE PART OF OUR COUNTRY.
 WE ARE VERY PRAGMATIC PEOPLE.
 I AM COMPLETELY WILLING TO WORK
 WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH
 THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED
 CONGRESS AND THE DEMOCRATICALLY
 CONTROLLED HOUSE.
 BECAUSE IT REALLY IS THAT
 IMPORTANT THAT WE FIX THE
 ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY
 OF QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR OUR
 PEOPLE.
 BUT I'M DUBIOUS, PROBABLY AT
 BEST, IN TERMS OF THE
 OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS
 ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES FOR THAT
 PATHWAY.
 SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
 ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S RALLY LAST
 NIGHT.
 THE PRESIDENT'S SON DONALD JR.

 WAS WARMING UP THE CROWD, AND HE
 DID SO BY BLASTING YOUR FELLOW
 FRESHMAN CONGRESSWOMAN
 ALEXANDRIA OCACIO-CORTEZ.
 THE CROWD RESPONDED BY SAYING
 "AOC SUCKS."
 LET'S WATCH.
 WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER, YOUR
 COLLEAGUE IN THIS INCOMING CLASS
 THAT MAKES HER SUCH A LIGHTNING
 ROD FOR CONSERVATIVES, DO YOU
 THINK?
 I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS
 THERE WERE TWO THINGS THAT WERE
 REALLY SIGNATURE ISSUES IN MY
 CAMPAIGN AND IN MANY CAMPAIGNS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT WERE
 IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE.
 ONE WAS HEALTH CARE.
 THE SECOND THING WAS CIVILITY
 AND DECENCY.
 WE'VE SEEN THESE TWO THINGS COME
 UP IN THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT
 NOW, WHICH IS IT'S ABSOLUTELY
 UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE ARE
 MALIGNING PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE
 WITH OUR BELIEFS.
 I THINK WE SAW IT WITH SENATOR
 McCAIN, THE WAY TO BEHAVE WHEN
 WE'RE IN THINGS LIKE TOWN HALLS,
 IN THINGS LIKE RALLIES AND
 PEOPLE ARE MALIGNING AND
 DISPARAGING PEOPLE NOT LIKE US.
 AND THAT'S NOT OKAY.
 WE EXPECT MORE FROM OUR
 LEADERSHIP OF ALL FORMS IN TERMS
 OF THE WAY THAT WE MODEL BEING A
 DECENT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR
 COMMUNITY.
 SO I'M DISAPPOINTED IN PRESIDENT
 TRUMP AND IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 SON, FRANKLY, IN NOT LEADING BY
 EXAMPLE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.
 WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE, BUT WE
 SHOULDN'T DISRESPECT EACH OTHER.
CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH.

           That's a win.
       But it's not the only        reason I switched.
  GEICO's a company I can trust,
    with over 75 years of great       savings and service.

       Now that's a win-win.
        <i> Switch to GEICO.</i>
         <i> It's a win-win.</i>
        <i> Switch to GEICO.</i>

       The noninvasive test         you use at home.
      It all starts when your         doctor orders me.
         Then it's as easy         as Get, Go, Gone.
       You get me when I'm           delivered...

 THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT PLANNED FOR THIS TO BE A

 MR. SPEAKER, I THINK IT
 SHOULD BE A MATTER OF PROFOUND
 REGRET TO EVERY MEMBER OF THIS
 HOUSE THAT ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE
 BEEN UNABLE TO SUPPORT LEAVING
 THE EUROPEAN UNION IN AN ORDERLY
 FASHION.
 THERE HAS TO BE AN
 ALTERNATIVE PLAN.
 THE PRIME MINISTER MUST GO NOT
 AT ANY DETERMINED DATE IN THE
 FUTURE BUT NOW SO WE CAN DECIDE
 THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY
 THROUGH A GENERAL ELECTION.
 SO ANOTHER PLAN VOTED DOWN.
 A PRIME MINISTER ON THE BRINK OF
 RESIGNING AND ALMOST THREE YEARS
 OF PLANNING TO LEAVE THE
 EUROPEAN UNION ON HOLD.
 RICHARD QUEST OF "QUEST MEANS
 BUSINESS" IS OUTSIDE OF
 PARLIAMENT.
 RICHARD, THERE ARE SO MANY
 QUESTIONS HERE.
 THE BIG ONE IS, WHAT HAPPENS
 NEXT?
 Reporter: IF I KNEW THAT
 NOBODY KNOWS.
 ANYONE WHO DOES SAY THEY KNOW IS
 LYING.
 PARLIAMENT HAS NOW SINGULARLY
 REFUSED TO PASS THE PRIME
 MINISTER'S DEAL THREE TIMES.
 AND SO NOW EUROPE HAS SAID,
 WELL, YOU CAN HAVE HER LONGER IF
 YOU WANT IT, BUT YOU NEED TO
 COME UP WITH WHAT YOU WANT.
 THERE WILL BE MORE VOTES NEXT W.
 PARLIAMENT HAS TAKEN OVER,
 BASICALLY, AND THEY'RE DOING THE
 VOTES THEMSELVES.
 THERE ARE SOME REALLY CRUEL
 ANALOGIES BEING DRAWN, BRIANNA.
 FOR EXAMPLE, THE ■4MONTI■PYTHON
 SKETCHES OF WHICH EVERYONE IS SO
 FAMILIAR.
 THEY'RE DESCRIBING THE PRIME
 MINISTER'S DEAL AS THE DEAD
 PARROT.
 NO, SHE'S JUST RESTING.
 AND THESE PROTESTERS ESSENTIALLY
 SAYING, GET ON WITH IT.
 IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THE
 U.K. WILL LEAVE THE EUROPEAN
 UNION, BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY 100%
 WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF DOUBT A
 TOTAL UTTER MESS.
 WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE PRIME
 MINISTER?
 IS SHE GOING TO STAY OR GO,
 RICHARD?
 IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF WHEN.
 SHE PROMISED TO GO IN A DEAL
 WASN'T PASSED.
 IT WASN'T PASS■/■/■/
 ARE JUST WONDERING WHEN SHE'S
 GOING TO GO.
 IT'S SIMPLY NOT LIKELY THAT
 SHE'LL BE THE PRIME MINISTER AT
 THE END OF THE YEAR.
 THE ONLY THING THAT'S KEEPING
 HER THERE IS SHEER FEAR BY MANY
 MPs OF WHAT WILL COME NEXT AND
 THEN PAY A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
 WHO IS FURTHER RIGHT WING AND
 MORE HARD LINE BREXIT.
 THE PM IS BASICALLY DEAD WOMAN
 WALKING.
 ALL RIGHT, RICHARD QUEST IN
 LONDON, THANK YOU.

  Together we'll make the right             choice.
 PROSECUTORS WHO DROPPED
 FELONY CHARGES AGAINST ACTOR
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT HAVE
 FUNDAMENTALLY MISLED THE PUBLIC
 ON THE LAW AND THE DISMISSAL OF
 THE CHARGES.
 THAT IS THE ACCUSATION FROM AN
 ILLINOIS LAWYERS GROUP ABOUT
 COOK COUNTY STATE'S ATTORNEY KIM
 FOX AND HER OFFICE AND HOW
 THEY'VE HANDLED THIS.
 A GRAND JURY HAD INDICTED
 SMOLLETT ON 16 COUNTS IN A HATE
 CRIME HOAX AND IN A STUNNING
 REVERSAL THE PROSECUTOR DROPPED
 THE CHARGES AGAINST SMOLLETT ON
 TUESDAY SPARKING OUTRAGE FROM
 THE PRESIDENT, ILLINOIS
 LAWMAKERS, CHICAGOANS INCLUDING
 THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO WHO SAID
 THAT HE WANTS SMOLLETT TO PAY
 MORE THAN $130,000 TO COVER THE
 COST OF THE INVESTIGATION.
 LET'S BRING IN ERIC SUSSMAN.
 HE'S A FORMER FIRST ASSISTANT
 STATE ATTORNEY FOR KIM FOX.
 HE'S JOINING US FROM CHICAGO.
 WITH YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING
 WORKED IN THIS OFFICE WITH KIM
 FOX, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
 HAPPENED HERE?
 WELL, I MEAN, THE BEST I CAN
 TELL, BOTH FROM WORKING IN THE
 OFFICE AS WELL AS TALKING TO THE
 LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES, IS THAT
 THE DEFENSE LAWYERS FOR JUSSIE
 SMOLLETT WENT IN AND THEY TOLD
 THE PROSECUTORS THEY HAVE
 SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THEIR
 CASE.
 I DON'T KNOW IF SOME OF IT HAD
 TO DO WITH THE REASONS WHY THE
 STATE'S ATTORNEY RECUSED HERSELF
 AND THE PROSECUTORS ULTIMATELY
 AGREED TO DISMISS THE CHARGES
 AND THEN ONCE THE PUBLIC GOT
 UPSET AND OUTRAGED, THEY TRIED
 TO JUSTIFY IT BY CALLING IT
 EITHER A DEFERRED PROSECUTION OR
 SAYING THIS HAPPENS ALL THE
 TIME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE
 DEMONSTRATIVELY FALSE.
 I THINK THOSE ARE THE DECEPTIONS
 THAT THE ILLINOIS STATE
 PROSECUTORS ASSOCIATION IS
 ZEROED IN ON AND THE FACT THAT,
 REALLY, AT THIS POINT THEIR
 MISLEADING THE PUBLIC IN TERMS
 OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED HERE.
 FOX SAYS AND HER OFFICE SAYS
 THAT SEALING THIS CRIMINAL
 CASE -- EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW
 WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE IT WAS
 SEALED AND THEY'RE SAYING IT WAS
 MANDATORY, THIS LAWYERS GROUP
 SAYS THAT IS NOT TRUE.
 DO YOU THINK IT WAS MANDATORY?
 IT IS NOT MANDATORY.
 THAT IS FALSE.
 AND THE STATE'S ATTORNEYS OFFICE
 THERE WAS A MOTION -- AN ORAL
 MOTION THAT WAS MADE.
 THE STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
 DIDN'T OBJECT.
 THEY SHOULD HAVE OBJECTED.
 THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THERE
 WAS NO CONVICTION TO EXPUNG, SO
 IT IS COMPLETELY SHROUDED IN
 MYSTERY AS TO WHY THE JUDGE
 ULTIMATELY SEALED THESE RECORDS.
 THERE CLEARLY WAS NO MANDATORY
 REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
 SEALED AND QUITE FRANKLY,
 THERE'S NO LEGAL REASON WHY THEY
 SHOULD BE SEALED AT THIS POINT
 IN TIME.
 THERE WAS ALSO AMONG THESE
 CONTRADICTIONS THIS EXAMPLE OF
 WHETHER FOX FORMALLY RECUSED
 HERSELF BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T.
 SHE MADE IT SOUND LIKE SHE WAS
 RECUSING HERSELF BUT HAD SHE
 RECUSED HERSELF HER OFFICE
 LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE HANDLED
 THIS CASE.
 SHOULD SHE HAVE PROPERLY AND
 FULLY RECUSED HERSELF IN THE
 LEGAL SENSE OF THE WORD?
 THERE ARE TWO ISSUES HERE.
 THE FIRST QUESTION IS, DID THE
 STATE'S ATTORNEY HAVE A CONFLICT
 OF INTEREST?
 BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN
 TERMS OF THE DISCUSSIONS WITH
 TINA CHEM AND THE DSSIO
 WITH THE VICTIM'S FAMILYR
 WITNESSES FAMILY THAT'S NOT A
 BASIS TO ASSUME THERE'S ANY TYPE
 OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
 THERE HAS TO BE A CONFLICT THERE
 FOR THE PROSECUTOR TO EVEN THINK
 OF RECUSING HERSELF.
 TO BE CLEAR,STATE'S ATTOR
 INTERVIEW WITNESSES, MEET WITH
 FALY MEMBERS, MEET WITH
 DEFENDANTS ALLHE TIME.
 THERE'S AN ENTIR UNIT OF THE
 STATE'S ATTORNEYS OFFICE AND
 THAT'S ALL THEY DO.
 THERE'S NOTHING BASED ON WHAT
 WE'VE SEEN IN THE RECORD THAT
 WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE STATE'S
 ATTORNEY BELIEVED SHE NEEDED TO
 RECUSE HERSELF ANY WAY, SHAPE OR
 FORM.
 THEN WE GET TO THE SOND
 ISSUE -- SORRY.
 OH, NO.
 I ONLY HAVE A MINUTE WITH YOU, I
 HAVE A QUESTION I REALLY WANT
 ANSWERED.
 IT'S A BROADER QUESTION.
 SO THIS WHOLE THING IS A MESS BY
 MANY ACCOUNTS.
 IT'S BEEN MISHANDLED, MS. FOXX
 HAS OTHER IMPORTANT CASES SHE'S
 HANDLING.
 SHE ENCOURAGED R. KELLY ACCUSERS
 TO COME FORWARD AND THEY IT.
 DOES SHE HAVE GOOD JUDGMENT TO
 HANDLE THESE OTHER THINGS?
 WELL, I MEAN, THE ANSWER IS
 CLEARLY SHE HAS SHOWN POOR
 JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE IN TERMS
 OF THE STATEMENTS SHE'S MAKING
 ABOUT MR. SMOLLETT AFTER THE
 CHARGES HAVE BE DROPPED WHICH
 ARE CLEARLY A VIOLATION OF
 PROSECUTORIAL ETHICS RULES AND
 E SECOND THING IS, I HAVE
 NEVER IN MY LIFE, AND I CAN'T
 THINK OF A PROSECUTOR THAT WOULD
 EVER GET ON AND MAKE A PUBLIC
 STATEMENT SOLICITING INFORMATION
 TO TRY TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE LIKE
 R. KELLY.
 IT'S IMPROPER.
 R. KELLY IS A PRIVA CITIZEN.
 HE'S PRESUMED INNOCENT AND UNTIL
 THEY BRING CHARGES, THERE IS NO
 BASIS FOR THEM TO BE OUT THERE
 IN ESSENCE FISHING FOR
 INFORMATION AND THEN GETTING
