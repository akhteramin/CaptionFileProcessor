And still going for my best, even though I live with a higher risk of stroke due to Afib not caused by a heart valve problem. So if there's a better treatment than warfarin... I want that too. ELIQUIS. ELIQUIS is proven to reduce stroke risk better than warfarin. Plus has significantly less major bleeding than warfarin. ELIQUIS is FDA-approved and has both. What's next? Reeling in a nice one. <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i> <i>as stopping increases your risk</i> <i> of having a stroke.</i> <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i> <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i> <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i> <i> an artificial heart valve</i> <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i> <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i> <i> you may bruise more easily</i> <i> and it may take longer than</i> <i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i> <i> Seek immediate medical care</i> <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i> <i> like unusual bruising.</i> <i> ELIQUIS may increase your</i> <i> bleeding risk</i> <i> if you take certain medicines.</i> <i> Tell your doctor</i> <i> about all planned medical</i> <i> or dental procedures.</i> ELIQUIS, the number one cardiologist-prescribed blood thinner. Ask your doctor if ELIQUIS is what's next for you. Guys do whatever it takes to deal with shave irritation. So, we re-imagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuard. It has a unique guard between the blades. That's designed to reduce irritation during the shave. Because we believe all men deserve a razor just for them. The best a man can get. Gillette.
