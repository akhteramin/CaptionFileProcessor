 YOU WANT TO SIGN THE BIBLE, THAT IS ONE DEBATE.
 I SUGGEST YOU OPEN IT UP AND
 BEGIN READING IT OR NEXT TIME
 YOU'RE ASKED, DON'T PROFESS TO
 BE ONE THAT PRACTICES IT AND AT
 LEAST ONE OR TWO VERSES THAT
 MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU BECAUSE
 MAYBE ALL OF IT AS YOU SAID WAS
 WHAT YOUR FAVORITE IS IS TOO
 MUCH TO CONSUME AND PRACTICE AT
 THE SAME TIME.
 THAT DOES IT FOR ME.
 THANKS FOR WATCHING.
 SEE YOU BACK HERE NEXT SATURDAY
 AT 5:00 P.M. EASTERN.
 UNTIL THEN, KEEP THE
 CONVERSATION GOING.
 LIKE US @FACEBOOK.COM/POLITICS
 NATION.

 UP NEXT, "MEET THE PRESS"
 WITH CHUCK TODD.
 THIS SUNDAY, DIVIDED
 DEMOCRATS.
 BERNIE VERSUS BIDEN.
 PROGRESSIVES VERSUS TRADITIONAL
 DEMOCRATS.
 HIGHLIGHTED BY THIS COMMENT FROM
 FRESHMAN CONGRESSWOMAN ILHAN
 OMAR.
 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE
 POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN THIS
 COUNTRY THAT SAYS IT IS OKAY FOR
 PEOPLE TO PUSH FOR ALLEGIANCE TO
 A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
 SOME FELLOW DEMOCRATS HERE
 BIGOTRY.
 THE USE OF ANTI-SEMITIC
 LANGUAGE AND IMAGES CAN NEVER BE
 TOLERATED.
 OTHERS RUSHED TO HER DEFENSE.
 I HEAR HER TRYING TO LIFT UP
 MY GRANDMOTHER IN THE WEST BANK.
 REAL FISSURES IN THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH
 IMPLICATION FOR 2020.
 MY GUESTS THIS MORNING, SHERROD
 BROWN OF OHIO AND LIZ CHENEY,
 CHAIR OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN
 CONFERENCE.
 PLUS, WAITING FOR BIDEN.
 ER HAVE SHERROD BROWN NOT
 RUNNING.
 BLOOMBERG, NOT RUNNING.
 BOTH LIKELY OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE
 EXPECTING JOE BIDEN TO GET IN.
 I HAVEN'T MADE THE FINAL
 DECISION.
 DON'T BE SURPRISED.
 WHAT IS BIDEN WAITING FOR?
 AND PARDON ME?
 DID MICHAEL COHEN ASK PRESIDENT
 TRUMP FOR A PARDON?
 I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR A
 PARDON.
 NOR WOULD I ACCEPT A PARDON.
 THAT'S A STONE-COLD LIE.
 I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT, THE
 MANAFORT SENTENCING AND THE
 LATEST ON THE RUSSIAN
 INVESTIGATION, WITH THE CHAIR OF
 THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE, ADAM SCHIFF.
 JOINING US IS KASIE HUNT.
 ROBERT COSTA, MODERATOR OF
 "WASHINGTON WEEK."
 MARIA TERESA KUMAR.
 PRESIDENT OF VIDEO -VOTO
 LATINO.
 AND THE FORMER REPUBLICAN
 GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA,
 PRESIDENT MccCRORY.
 WELCOME TO SUNDAY, AND "MEET THE
 PRESS."
 THIS IS "MEET THE PRESS,"
 WITH CHUCK TODD.
 GOOD SUNDAY MORNING.
 NEVER MIND THAT PRESIDENT
 TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN IS
 GOING TO PRISON AND THAT MR.
 TRUMP AND MICHAEL COHEN ARGUED
 THIS WEEK OVER WHICH ONE OF THEM
 IS LYING ABOUT A POSSIBLE
 PARDON.
 OUR COLLEAGUE, DANA MILBANK AT
 "THE WASHINGTON POST" POINTED
 OUT, THAT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 STRUGGLES WITH NORTH KOREA, ON
 THE TRADE DEFICIT, THE BORDER
 WALL, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
 THAT CAN SAVE HIM, THE
 DEMOCRATS.
 AS HE SAID, RIGHT ON CUE, HERE
 THEY COME.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT MUCH OF THE
 LAST MONTH WRESTLING THEMSELVES
 TO THE GROUND.
 THEY WERE EMBARRASSED OVER RALPH
 NORTHAM HAD ONCE DRESSED IN
 BLACKFACE.
 AND STARTLED BY SEXUAL
 HARASSMENT COMMENTS BY NORTHAM'S
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX.
 AND CHRONICALLY UNSURE TO HANDLE
 A COMMENT BY OMAR.
 AND EMERGING GROUP OF DEMOCRATS
 IS CONTINUING INTO CONFLICT WITH
 THE LIBERALS.
 THEY'RE UNITED AND DIVIDED.
 THEY'RE UNITED ABOUT THE URGENCY
 OF DEFEATING PRESIDENT TRUMP
 NEXT YEAR.
 AT THE SAME TIME, THEY ARE
 DIVIDED, WITH EACH SIDE SEEING
 THE OTHER AS THE REASON MR.
 TRUMP MAY WIND UP WINNING AFTER
 ALL.
 YOU APOLOGIZED FOR YOUR LAST
 REMARKS.
 HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT?
 Reporter: CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR
 DREW CRITICISM AFTER TWEETING
 THAT U.S. POLITICIANS SUPPORT
 ISRAEL BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT
 THE BENJAMINS, BABY.
 SHE APOLOGIZED BUT THEN MADE
 THIS COMMENT LAST WEEK.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
 POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN THIS
 COUNTRY THAT SAYS IT IS OKAY FOR
 PEOPLE TO PUSH FOR ALLEGIANCE TO
 A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
 JEWS HAVE DUAL LOYALTY AND
 CANNOT BE PATRIOTIC MEMBERS OF
 THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY LIVE?
 WORDS MATTER.
 Reporter: SOME PROGRESSIVES
 DEFENDED OMAR, POINTING TO SLURS
 AGAINST HER.
 LIKE THIS FLYER IN WEST
 VIRGINIA.
 WE THINK THAT HATE AND RACISM
 IN OUR COUNTRY IS GROWING, IF
 YOU'RE JEWISH, LGBTQ,
 LATINO, IMMIGRANTS, MUSLIM.
 Reporter: HOUSE DEMOCRATS
 UNITED AROUND A BROAD RESOLUTION
 CONDEMNING HATE.
 AFTER AN OFFICIAL DRAFT THAT
 REBUKED ANTI-SEMITISM.
 THE ISSUE IS DIVIDING 2020
 DEMOCRATS.
 I THINK IT WAS RIGHT IN THIS
 CASE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE
 HOUSE OF REPUBLICANS WASN'T ABLE
 TO TOLERATE HATEFUL STATEMENTS.
 Reporter: BUT TOP
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, WHILE
 CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITISM, SAYS
 THAT OMAR WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED.
 THE DEBATE IS EXPOSING
 IDEOLOGICAL, GENERATIONAL AND
 RACIAL DIVIDES IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY.
 AS THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT IS
 SHOWING ITS STRENGTH.
 IT IS TIME TO BREAK UP THE
 TECH GIANTS.
 Reporter: SOME DEMOCRATS ARE
 RELUCTANT TO EMBRACE CAPITALISM.
 YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THE LABELS
 I'M NOT SURE ANY OF THEM FIT.
 Reporter: CHAMPIONING THE
 GREEN NEW DEAL.
 DOES THE GREEN NEW DEAL GO
 TOO FAR?
 NO.
 YOU CANNOT GO TOO FAR ON THE
 ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
 Reporter: AND CALLING FOR
 MEDICARE FOR ALL.
 DO YOU THINK ELIMINATING
 PRIVATE INSURANCE WOULD BE A
 SOCIALIST IDEA?
 NO.
 I STRONGLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO
 HAVE MEDICARE FOR ALL.
 Reporter: CAN A CENTRIST
 CANDIDATE BREAK THROUGH IN A
 PARTY THAT IS SHIFTING TO THE
 LEFT?
 WHY SHOULD WE ELECT A
 CANDIDATE THAT SAYS, IT'S NOT
 POSSIBLE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT
 PROGRESSIVES WANT?
 BECAUSE I'M BEING HONEST.
 Reporter: THIS WEEK, MICHAEL
 BLOOMBERG AND OHIO SENATOR,
 SHERROD BROWN, SAID NO THANKS TO
 A PRESIDENTIAL RUN, WITH FORMER
 VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN POISED
 TO JUMP INTO THE RACE.
 I HAVE NOT MADE THE FINAL
 DECISION.
 BUT DON'T BE SURPRISED.
 Reporter: BEFORE HIS RUN IS
 OFFICIAL, BIDEN IS EXPLAINING A
 DECADES-LONG RECORD, INCLUDING
 HIS ROLE IN PASSING THE NOW
 CONTROVERSIAL 1994 CRIME BILL.
 HIS VOTE FOR THE IRAQ WAR,
 SKEPTICISM OF ANITA HILL AND
 PAST COMMENTS ON BUSSING TO
 DESEGREGATE SCHOOLS.
 I HAVE BEEN IN THIS FIGHT FOR
 A LONG TIME.
 I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT.
 I KNOW WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS GOTTEN
 THINGS RIGHT.
 BUT I'VE ALWAYS TRIED.
 AND JOINING ME NOW FROM
 CLEVELAND, IS DEMOCRATIC
 GOVERNOR SHERROD BROWN, WHO
 ANNOUNCED TO THE SURPRISE OF
 MANY, THAT HE DECIDED NOT TO RUN
 FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020.
 WELCOME BACK TO "MEET THE
 PRESS."
 GOOD TO BE BACK.
 THANKS.
 COLOR US VERY SURPRISED.
 IN FACT, THE LAST TIME I WERE
 ON, MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER NOTED
 HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT HIS
 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE
 PRESENT TENSE.
 IT SEEMED SO IMMINENT TO US.
 YOU DID SURPRISE A LOT OF
 PEOPLE.
 YOU HAD BEGUN TO HIRE SOME
 PEOPLE.
 WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?
 AS YOU KNOW, CHUCK, THIS
 STARTED OFF BECAUSE I DON'T
 THINK DEMOCRATS WERE TALKING TO
 WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS OF ALL
 RACES ENOUGH.
 IF YOU LOVE YOUR COUNTRY, YOU
 WILL FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
 MAKE IT WORK, WE BEGAN OUR
 DIGNITY OF WORK TOUR.
 IN FOUR STATES.
 WE HIRED PEOPLE TO HELP US WITH
 THE TOUR AND TO BE READY.
 OUR GOAL WAS TO INFORM THE
 NARRATIVE IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY, SO THAT DEMOCRATS TALKED
 MORE TO WORKERS AND A NUMBER OF
 CANDIDATES HAVE ALREADY DONE
 THAT.
 HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE
 DIGNITY OF WORK.
 I PREDICT THAT THE DEMOCRATIC
 NOMINEE IS THE ONE THAT TALKS TO
 WORKERS THE BEST.
 AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
 WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRIAL
 MIDWEST.
 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL
 THERAPISTS IN NEVADA AND THE
 CONSTRUCTION WORKER IN NEW
 HAMPSHIRE AND THE HOSPITAL
 WORKER IN BALTIMORE.
 I WOULD PREDICT, IF I COULD DO
 THIS, THAT COME JANUARY 20th,
 2021, THAT IN THE INAUGURAL,
 WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENT-ELECT RAISES HER OR
 HIS RIGHT HAND, THEY WILL LAUNCH
 INTO A SPEECH, THEIR INAUGURAL
 SPEECH WILL TALK ABOUT THE
 DIGNITY OF WORK.
 IT'S NOT JUST A SLOGAN, IT'S WHO
 I AM AND WHAT WE FIGHT FOR.
 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S HOW
 WE GOVERN.
 TO REINFORCE WHAT YOU'RE
 SAYING, WE PUT TOGETHER A
 COLLECTION OF FOLKS THAT STOLE
 YOUR LINE.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 WE HAVE TO REWARD AND
 RECOGNIZE THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
 THERE IS DIGNITY IN ALL WORK
 AND CAREER PROFESSIONALS.
 WE HAVE TO GIVE IT THE
 DIGNITY OF THE WORK BEING
 PERFORMED.
 SENATOR, YOUR MESSAGE, YOU'RE
 DOING SOMETHING THAT MANY
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WISH
 COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM.
 YOUR INITIAL MESSAGE BEGINS TO
 RESONATE TO THE POINT THAT YOU
 HAVE COMPETITORS STEALING YOUR
 LINES.
 SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
 HOW DO YOU NOT RUN?
 IT WAS RESONATING AND YOU STILL
 SAID NO.
 IT WAS RESONATING AND I WOULD
 SAY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BUT I'M
 NOT DONE YET.
 I CAN DO THAT BETTER FROM THE
 SENATE.
 WE SPENT THREE MONTHS TALKING
 ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
 I'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT.
 I WENT TO THE FLOOR AFTER I
 ANNOUNCED I WASN'T GOING TO RUN
 AND TALKED ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS
 AND VOTING RIGHTS AND WORKER
 RIGHTS AND A SUPREME COURT THAT
 PUTS ITS THUMB ON THE SCALES OF
 JUSTICE, IN FAVORING
 CORPORATIONS OVER WORKERS AND
 HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY OVER
 SICK PEOPLE AND WALL STREET OVER
 CONSUMERS.
 I WILL CONTINUE THAT ECONOMIC
 POPULOUS FIGHT, ALWAYS THROUGH
 THE EYES OF WORKERS.
 IT'S WHAT WE ARE AS A PARTY.
 I THINK I CAN DRIVE THAT BETTER
 FROM THE SENATE THAN I CAN AS
 ONE OUT OF 15, 20 PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES.
 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
 TALKED TO JOE BIDEN?
 OCTOBER.
 SO, YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
 RECENTLY?
 THIS WASN'T HIM CALLING AROUND,
 LETTING PEOPLE KNOW HE'S
 RUNNING?
 IT WAS NONE OF THAT.
 I KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN
 REPORTED.
 BUT THE PEOPLE THAT REPORTED
 THAT NEVER CALLED ME, NEVER
 CALLED CONNIE, NEVER CALLED
 SARAH BENZENE, MY CHIEF OF
 STAFF.
 NEVER CALLED MY COMMUNICATIONS
 DIRECTOR.
 I LIKE JOE BIDEN.
 I JUST HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM.
 PEOPLE ASK ME IN ALMOST EVERY
 ONE OF THE STATES, IS JOE BIDEN
 GETTING IN HAVING AN IMPACT ON
 YOUR DECISION?
 AND MY ANSWER WAS ALWAYS ZERO.
 WHEN PEOPLE WERE ASSESSING
 YOUR CANDIDACY, YOU WERE SEEN AS
 ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT COULD
 BRIDGE THIS DIVIDE.
 YOU'RE A GUY THAT FIGURED OUT
 HOW TO WIN IN THE RED STATE.
 BUT ALSO HAD KEPT TO SOME
 PROGRESSIVE PRINCIPLES.
 IN FACT, HERE'S WHAT YOU TOLD
 THE NATION IN AN INTERVIEW.
 YOU SAID, IF I RUN, I WILL BE
 THE ONLY DEMOCRAT ON THE STAGE
 WHO WILL HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE
 IRAQ WAR, WHO WILL HAVE VOTED
 AGAINST THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE
 ACT, WHICH MEANS FOR MARRIAGE
 EQUALITY, AND WHO WILL BE
 PRO-CHOICE 100% OVER THE YEARS.
 WHAT WAS INTERESTING, IT WAS
 YOUR WAY OF SAYING, I'M AN
 EXPERIENCED DEMOCRAT BUT ON THE
 PROGRESSIVE SIDE OF THE LANE IN
 WAYS THAT OTHER DEMOCRATS,
 PERHAPS YOU'RE REFERRING TO JOE
 BIDEN, WERE NOT.
 I WAS REFERRING TO NOBODY IN
 PARTICULAR.
 I WAS JUST SAYING THAT I'VE BEEN
 A STRONG PROGRESSIVE FOR YEARS.
 I WILL CARRY THAT BACK TO THE
 SENATE.
 I WILL BE PART OF THIS
 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, IN TERMS
 OF CALLING OUT THIS PRESIDENT
 FOR HIS PHONY POPULISM.
 POPULISM IS NEVER RACIST OR
 ANTI-SEMITIC.
 POPULISM DOESN'T DIVIDE PEOPLE.
 POPULISM DON'T GIVE TAX CUTS TO
 THE RICHEST PEOPLE OF THE
 COUNTRY AND TRY TO CUT MEDICARE
 AND HEAD START.
 I WILL POINT OUT HOW THIS
 PRESIDENT HAS BETRAYED THE AUTO
 WORKERS AND HOSPITAL WORKERS.
 I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT
 CASE FROM THE FLOOR OF THE
 SENATE, FROM TRAVELS AROUND THE
 COUNTRY, BY NOT YET SUPPORTING
 ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BUT
 MOVING THE DEBATE FORWARD ABOUT
 DIGNITY OF WORK.
 LET ME ASK YOU THIS -IS
 THERE A DANGER OF GOING TOO FAR
 TO THE LEFT THAT IT MIGHT SCARE
 SOME VOTERS, SAY, IN OHIO?
 I HEAR THE STORIES THAT ARE,
 THAT'S THE STORY OF THE DAY,
 ABOUT DEMOCRATS MOVING TO THE
 LEFT.
 I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT STORY
 UP
 IS HOW REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO
 MOVE TO THE RIGHT, HOW PRESIDENT
 TRUMP EXTOLS -BETRAYS WORKERS
 AND UTTERS RACIST, ANTI-SEMITIC
 RHETORIC.
 NOBODY IN THEIR PARTY CALLS THEM
 OUT.
 THEY DON'T HAVE DIVISIONS.
 THEY'VE FOLLOWED HIS RACIST
 ACTIONS AND BETRAYAL OF WORKERS.
 THEY FOLLOW IT LIKE LEMMINGS OFF
 THE CLIFF.
 THAT'S THE STORY, NOT SOME
 DEGREES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
 AND AMONG DEMOCRATS.
 THAT'S THE REAL STORY.
 LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
 WHAT IS FAIR GAME?
 YOU IN THAT INTERVIEW SAID, IN
 1996, WHEN IT WASN'T A POPULAR
 THING TO DO, YOU VOTED AGAINST
 THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT, FOR
 INSTANCE.
 JOE BIDEN HAS COMMENTS ABOUT
 BUSSING AND DESEGREGATION OF
 SCHOOLS THAT ARE POPPING UP,
 QUOTES FROM HIM IN THE '70s.
 YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT
 WAS THE MAINSTREAM DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY POSITION, PERHAPS, IN THE
 '70s.
 SHOULD THOSE COMMENTS MATTER TO
 VOTERS IN IOWA, TO DEMOCRATS IN
 IOWA IN THE 21st CENTURY?
 IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
 SHERROD BROWN THINKS ABOUT THE
 MATTERS TO VOTERS IN IOWA?
 DOES IT MATTER TO YOU?
 RECORDS MATTER TO ME.
 THE CANDIDATE THAT IS TALKING --
 I GO BACK TO, WHAT ARE THEY
 GOING TO DO ABOUT TALKING TO
 WORKERS AND THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
 I WANT TO SEE DIGNITY OF WORK,
 NOT JUST PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN,
 NOT JUST A SLOGAN, NOT JUST WHAT
 THE CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT, I
 WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GOVERN
 BASED ON THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
 REGARDLESS OF THE WORK YOU DO,
 IT'S ABOUT WAGES OR BENEFITS.
 WORKPLACE SAFETY, ABOUT CHILD
 CARE, IN THE NEVADA -IN THE
 CULINARY WORKERS UNION HALL IN
 LAS VEGAS, CONNIE AND I WERE
 THERE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO,
 THEIR SLOGAN IS, ONE JOB SHOULD
 BE ENOUGH.
 I WANT TO HEAR WORKERS START
 TALKING ABOUT THAT, THAT ONE
 LIVING WAGE JOB SHOULD BE
 ENOUGH.
 WITH HEALTH CARE, WITH
 RETIREMENT, WITH CHILD CARE,
 WITH SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE.
 THAT'S EVERYTHING, TO ME IN THIS
 RACE.
 THAT'S A WINNING MESSAGE AND
 IT'S THE WAY WE SHOULD GOVERN,
 STARTING IN 2021.
 I'M GOING TO CLOSE WITH THE
 SAME QUESTION I ASKED YOU AT THE
 BEGINNING.
 I DIDN'T HEAR AN ANSWER WHY YOU
 DIDN'T RUN.
 IS IT SIMPLY, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
 DO IT?
 I THINK WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN
 MOVING FORWARD AS WE HAVE.
 I -I WAS TALKING TO SOME
 PEOPLE ABOUT THIS.
 YOU CAN RUN IN THREE DIFFERENT
 WAYS.
 YOU CAN RUN AS EEIOR, I DIDN'T
 WANT TO DO DO THAT OR BE THE
 ANGRY CANDIDATE, I DIDN'T WANT
 TO DO THAT.
 OR YOU CAN RUN AS AN OPTIMIST,
 JOYFUL CANDIDATE, THE WAY I DO
 MY JOB IN THE SENATE.
 I THINK I CAN DO THAT BETTER IN
 THE SENATE, IN CONTINUING TO
 PERFORM THIS PRESIDENTIAL
 CHOICE.
 YOU'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T RUN
 FOR PRESIDENT JOYFULLY.
 THAT'S WHAT I JUST HEARD.
 SORRY.
 I THINK I CAN DO IT BETTER IN
 THE SENATE.
 FAIR ENOUGH.
 LEAVE IT AT THAT, CHUCK.
 SENATOR SHERROD BROWN.
 IT'S ALWAYS JOYFUL BEING ON
 YOUR SHOW.
 THAT, I APPRECIATE.
 IT'S SUNDAY MORNING, CUP OF
 COFFEE AND YOU SPRUNG FORWARD.
 THAT I APPRECIATE.
 EVEN WHEN THE TIME CHANGES
 AND YOU MAKE ME GET UP AN HOUR
 EARLIER.
 SENATOR --
 AND YOU BROADCAST IT LATER
 AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW EARLY
 WE GOT UP.
 YOU AN YOUR OHIO COLLEAGUE,
 JOHN KASICH, YOU GUYS KNOW HOW
 TO TALK TO YOUR OHIO VOTERS.
 THANK YOU, SIR.
 MUCH APPRECIATED.
 JOINING ME NOW IS THE CHAIR
 OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN
 CONFERENCE, CONGRESSWOMAN LIZ
 CHENEY.
 I WANT TO START WITH WHAT
 HAPPENED IN THE HOUSE THIS WEEK.
 IT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE.
 YOU VOTED AGAINST THIS BROAD
 RESOLUTION.
 AND WHILE YOUR CRITICISM OF THE
 RESOLUTION, I TOTALLY
 UNDERSTAND.
 BUT YOU WERE IN THE MINORITY OF
 YOUR PARTY.
 DID YOUR FELLOW HOUSE
 REPUBLICANS MAKE A MISTAKE BY
 VOTING WITH THE DEMOCRATS ON
 THIS RESOLUTION?
 NO.
 I THINK THERE WERE TWO WAYS WE
 COULD HAVE GONE.
 SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR
 CONFERENCE LOOKED AT IT AND
 SAID, THERE'S NOTHING
 OBJECTIONABLE IN THE RESOLUTION.
 MY STATEMENT MADE CLEAR THAT
 THAT WAS MY VIEW AS WELL.
 I DECIDED TO VOTE AGAINST IT
 BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS AN EFFORT
 PROTECT ILHAN OMAR, TO COVER UP
 HER BIGOTRY AND ANTI-SEMITISM BY
 REFUSING TO NAME HER.
 THE DEMOCRATS HAVE YET TO TAKE
 ANY ACTION TO REMOVE HER FROM
 HER COMMITTEE.
 AND THEY HAVE A REAL PROBLEM.
 THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE
 ABIDING BY ANTI-SEMITISM,
 ENABLING ANTI-SEMITISM IN THEIR
 PARTY IS SOMETHING THEY STRUGGLE
 WITH.
 BUT SOMETIMES IT'S VERY
 DANGEROUS FOR THE COMPANY.
 I'M HOPEFUL THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
 STAND UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING
 ON THIS.
 THERE WAS SOME CRITICISM,
 SOME PEOPLE WERE PEEVED AT
 CHENEY, MEANING YOU.
 THINKING THAT AMONG MOST TOP
 REPUBLICANS ARE THIS.
 WHEN YOU'RE A LEADERSHIP TEAM,
 YOU STICK TOGETHER.
 THE CRITICISM BEING, SINCE
 YOU'RE A MEMBER OF LEADERSHIP,
 YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN WITH ONE
 VOICE.
 I THINK, YOU KNOW HOW THE
 HILL WORKS.
 THOSE ANONYMOUS SOURCES THAT ARE
 OUT THERE SNIPING.
 THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO BE
 FOCUSED ON AND REMEMBER, THE
 DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE
 FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 MONTHS IN THE
 HOUSE.
 IN THAT TIME, THEY'VE BEEN THE
 PARTY OF ANTI-SEMITISM, THE
 PARTY OF INFANTICIDE, THE PARTY
 OF SOCIALISM.
 THEY PASSED LEGISLATION THAT
 VIOLATED THE FIRST AND THE
 SECOND AMENDMENT.
 IT'S REALLY TIME FOR THE
 DEMOCRATS, THE LEADERSHIP IN
 THAT PARTY, TO STOP IT, TO STAND
 UP AND TO ACT WORTHY, FRANKLY,
 OF THE TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 HAVE PLACED IN THEM.
 IT'S CRUCIAL FOR THE NATION.
 I WANT TO UNPACK A COUPLE
 THINGS.
 FIRST, ON THE ISSUE OF -YOU
 THINK CONGRESSMAN OMAR SHOULD
 LOSE HER COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.
 YOU FOUGHT FOR STEVE KING TO BE
 STRIPPED OF HIS COMMITTEE
 ASSIGNMENTS.
 WHY SHOULD CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS
 DO THIS?
 IF THE VOTERS SEND THESE FOLKS
 -THE VOTERS IN WESTERN IOWA
 KNOW STEVE KING.
 FOR BETTER OR WORSE.
 AND THE VOTERS IN MINNESOTA KNEW
 HER COMMENTS WERE VERY MUCH
 WELL-PUBLICIZED.
 IF THEY SEND THEM THERE, SHOULD
 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS REALLY BE
 TELLING -BE STRIPPING, NOT
 ALLOWING THEM ON COMMITTEES?
 THE POINT IS, VOTERS SEND
 THEM THERE.
 NOBODY IS SAYING WE'RE GOING TO
 EXPEL THEM.
 WE RESPECT THE DECISIONS THAT
 THE VOTERS HAVE MADE.
 BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
 THAT SHOULDN'T BE PART OF THE
 PUBLIC DISCOURSE.
 WHITE SUPREMACY IS ONE OF THOSE.
 AND ANTI-SEMITISM, THE HISTORY
 OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T
 STAND UP TO THE EVIL, THE
 HISTORY OF HOW QUICKLY WORDS
 TURN INTO SOMETHING MORE
 HORRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO
 ANTI-SEMITISM.
 AS A NATION, WE MUST, AT ALL
 TIMES, STAND UP TO IT.
 AND THE KIND OF ANTI-SEMITISM
 THAT YOU'RE SEEING FROM ILHAN
 OMAR AND BEING SUPPORTED BY HER
 COLLEAGUES IS A KIND OF
 ANTI-SEMITISM THAT CAN CREEP IN
 AND BEING NORMALIZED IN OUR
 DISCOURSE AND WE HAVE AN
 OBLIGATION NOT TO LET THAT
 HAPPEN.
 THERE IS AN ANTI-SEMITISM
 THAT HAS CREPT IN.
 LOOK AT GEORGE SOROS.
 THE REPUBLICAN ATTACKS OVER
 GEORGE SOROS.
 AND KEVIN McCARTHY HAD TO PULL
 ONE TWEET THAT HE WAS TRYING TO
 BUY THIS OR BUY THAT.
 THAT'S GOTTEN MAINSTREAMED TO
 THE POINT THAT GEORGE SOROS SAID
 THAT SOME GUY WAS TRYING TO PIPE
 BOMB HIM.
 THIS WHAT ABOUTISM, WHERE
 EVERYBODY TRIES TO POINT TO THE
 OTHER SIDE --
 CHUCK, CHUCK --
 AND IT'S GETTING --
 THE WHAT ABOUTISM SHOULD NOT
 GO ON.
 AND EVERYONE, INCLUDING LEADER
 McCARTHY HAS STOOD UP FIRMLY TO
 CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM.
 THE THING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE
 FOCUSED ON IS THE DEMOCRATS IN
 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
 SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS
 THEMSELVES, ARE COMPLETELY
 FRUSTRATED WITH THE FACT THAT
 THE LEADERSHIP IS -THEY ARE
 PROTECTING HER.
 THIS ISN'T JUST BEING SILENT.
 THEY ARE PROTECTING HER, BY
 FAILING TO PUT A RESOLUTION ON
 THE FLOOR THAT NAMES HER AND
 THAT STRIPS HER OF HER COMMITTEE
 ASSIGNMENT.
 INSTEAD, THEY PUT A RESOLUTION
 ON THE FLOOR THAT SHE SAID THIS
 IS A TREMENDOUS VICTORY FOR ME.
 NOW, IF WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE
 IN A POSITION WHERE YOU SAY THE
 KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAS
 SAID, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN,
 IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND
 HAS NO PLACE IN OUR DISCOURSE,
 THEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO WON'T
 CONDEMN IT ARE ENABLING IT.
 THERE WAS CONCERN BY SINGLING
 HER OUT, YOU ONLY MAKE A TARGET
 AND THEY POINTED TO THE WEST
 VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN PARTY FLYER.
 CHUCK, I'M SORRY --
 BUT MY POINT IS WE'RE
 GETTING --
 YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY,
 CHUCK.
 WE'RE GETTING IN A DANGEROUS
 WAY IF WE DO THIS.
 BUT YOU ARE WRONG.
 YOU HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS
 COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD
 WHERE WE'VE SEEN THE GLOBAL RISE
 OF ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS, YOU
 HAVE THE KIND OF ATTACKS WE HAD
 ON THE SYNAGOGUE HERE IN THE
 UNITED STATES RECENTLY.
 THAT'S A MOTIVE --
 THAT WAS MOTIVATED BY FRINGE
 IDEOLOGY.
 ANTI-SEMITIC, NO MATTER WHERE
 IT COMES FROM, IS WRONG.
 WHEN YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE
 YOU ARE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, WE
 HAVE THE HISTORY THAT WE HAVE,
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T
 STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS EVIL,
 AND CALL IT WHAT IT IS.
 WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO
 THAT.
 AND I THINK IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT
 NANCY PELOSI AND LEADER HOYER
 AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WILL NOT
 PUT HER NAME IN THE RESOLUTION
 ON THE FLOOR AND CONDEMN HER
 REMARKS AND REMOVE HER FROM THE
 HOUSE FOREIGN --
 YOU FEEL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
 HAS DONE ENOUGH TO TAMP DOWN THE
 RIGHT-WING FRINGE ANTI-SEMITISM
 THAT'S COMING UP?
 I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S RIGHT OR
 LEFT.
 THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE WE SHOULD
 ALL COME TOGETHER, THE
 PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT,
 THE SENATE, THE HOUSE, NO MATTER
 WHAT YOUR PARTY IS.
 STAND UP AND SAY IN TODAY'S
 WORD, WHEN ANTI-SEMITISM IS ON
 THE RISE, WHEN WE HAVE THE
 HISTORY THAT WE HAVE AND WE KNOW
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE REMAIN
 SILENT, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US
 MUST AT ALL TIMES STAND AGAINST
 IT.
 THERE'S A COUPLE FOREIGN
 POLICY HEADLINES.
 THIS WAS THE PRESIDENT ON FRIDAY
 ABOUT NORTH KOREA.
 I HAVE A FEELING THAT OUR
 RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA,
 KIM JONG-UN AND MYSELF, CHAIRMAN
 KIM, I THINK IT'S A GOOD ONE.
 AND I THINK IT REMAINS GOOD.
 I WOULD BE SURPRISED IN A
 NEGATIVE WAY IF HE DID ANYTHING
 THAT WAS NOT PER OUR
 UNDERSTANDING.
 THIS IS WHAT WE LEARNED THIS
 WEEK.
 HE'S ACCELERATING THE ROCKET
 PROGRAM AGAIN.
 HE'S ENRICHED MORE URANIUM
 BETWEEN THE TWO SUMMITS.
 AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY WERE
 RECONSTITUTING THE PROGRAMS
 WHILE THE SUMMIT -SECOND
 SUMMIT WAS TAKING PLACE.
 THE PRESIDENT THERE.
 YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD
 ON THIS, CAN YOU?
 WE HAVE WATCHED KIM JONG-UN
 AND HIS FATHER AND HIS
 GRANDFATHER OPERATE THE SAME
 WAY, NOW, FOR DECADES.
 AND I WOULD SAY THAT REPUBLICAN
 AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS
 GOT TAKEN BY HIM.
 I HOPE THIS PRESIDENT WON'T.
 I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THEIR
 EFFORTS ARE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR.
 HASN'T HE GOTTEN MORE OUT OF
 THIS PRESIDENT BY GETTING
 RESPECT ON THE WORLD STAGE?
 I THINK THE FACT THAT THE
 PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM THE
 SUMMIT IN VIETNAM IS A POSITIVE
 THING.
 THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
 WE DON'T WANT A BAD DEAL.
 IT MAKES US LESS SAFE.
 BEFORE I LET YOU GO, THE
 PRESIDENT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT A
 BUDGET AND THERE'S SOMETHING IN
 THIS THAT'S GOING TO BE QUITE
 ALARMING TO SOME ALLIES.
 THE PRESIDENT WILL ADVOCATE,
 PERHAPS, WHERE WE HAVE TROOPS
 OVERSEAS, THINK JAPAN, SOUTH
 KOREA, GERMANY, HE'S GOING TO
 ASK FOR COST-PLUS 50.
 ESSENTIALLY TAX COUNTRIES OVER
 AND ABOVE WHERE WE HAVE BASES.
 WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE
 DIPLOMACY FOR THIS COUNTRY?
 I THINK IT WOULD BE
 ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING.
 WE BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST 70
 YEARS, WE ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT
 FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FREEDOM,
 PROSPERITY, AND SAFETY BECAUSE
 OF THE BASES AND OUR COOPERATION
 WITH THE ALLIES.
 THE NOTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO
 CHARGE THEM COST PLUS 50 IS
 WRONG HEADED AND IT WOULD BE
 DAMAGING TO THE NATION.
 YOU THINK YOUR REPUBLICAN
 PARTY WILL SUPPORT THIS?
 I WON'T.
 BUT THE PARTY MIGHT?
 WELL, I THINK IT'S GOING TO
 BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE
 SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE
 DANGER THAT WILL DO TO OUR
 RELATIONSHIPS AND TO OUR
 FUNDAMENTAL SECURITY.
 OUR SECURITY, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
 PROTECT IT BECAUSE OF OUR
 ALLIANCES AND BECAUSE WE HAVE
 BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH
 COUNTRIES.
 WE SHOULD NOT LOOK AT THIS THAT
 WE NEED TO CHARGE THEM RENT FOR
 THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING OUR
 FORCES THERE BECAUSE THAT DOES
 US A HUGE BENEFIT, AS WELL.
 CONGRESSWOMAN LIZ CHENEY,
 THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, DEMOCRATS
 ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME
 GROWING PAINS REPUBLICANS DID
 WHEN THE TEA PARTY EMERGED.
 IT'S HARD TO KEEP COMPETING
 FACTIONS HAPPY.
 AND THE WAITING FOR BIDEN
 CAMPAIGN.
 THE PANEL IS NEXT.
 So, we re-imagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuard.
      It has a unique guard      between the blades.
   That's designed to reduce   irritation during the shave.
  Because we believe all men  deserve a razor just for them.
     The best a man can get.
            Gillette.
  If you want to know why people  sacrifice everything for love,
  you have to start by asking...
    <i> Could listening to Audible</i>     <i> help you find the secret</i>
   <i> to a stronger relationship?</i>
    Sometimes it doesn't take    anything at all for us...
         <i> Just say "Alexa,</i>  <i> give me my free Audible book,"</i>
          <i> and your first</i>          <i> pick is on us.</i>
 WELCOME BACK. PANEL IS HERE.
 PAT McCRORY, THE FOREMAN
 GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA.
 MARIA TERESA KUMAR, PRESIDENT OF
 VOTO LATINO.
 KASIE HUNT.
 CAPITOL HILL NEWS CORRESPONDENT.
 AND ROBERT COSTA, THE MODERATOR
 OF "WASHINGTON WEEK" ON PBS.
 KASIE, LET'S UNPACK THE HILL
 BEFORE WE GET TO THE
 PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
 THE HILL DEBATE IS GOING TO
 ANIMATE THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
 LET ME PLAY NANCY PELOSI ON OMAR
 FROM FRIDAY.
 THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED
 WAS, I DON'T THINK OUR COLLEAGUE
 IS ANTI-SEMITIC.
 I THINK SHE HAS A DIFFERENT
 EXPERIENCE IN THE USE OF WORDS,
 DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF
 THEM ARE FRAUGHT WITH MEANING
 THAT SHE DIDN'T REALIZE.
 BUT NONETHELESS, THAT WE HAD TO
 ADDRESS.
 I WILL SAY THIS, SPEAKER
 PELOSI HAS GIVEN ME MY NEW
 FAVORITE EXCUSE, SHE HAS A
 DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WITH THE
 USE OF WORDS.
 THAT IS EASILY ONE OF MY
 FAVORITE NEW PHRASES.
 THIS IS NOT EASY.
 IT'S NOT EASY, CHUCK.
 ONE THING IF YOU SPEAK WITH
 MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
 WHO ARE FRUSTRATED HOW THEIR
 PARTY HANDLED THIS.
 THERE ARE JEWISH AND NON-JEWISH
 DEMOCRATS THAT ARE FRANKLY UPSET
 THAT THIS RESOLUTION WAS AS
 BROAD AS IT WAS.
 THEY'LL SAY THIS IS THE THIRD
 TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.
 YOU KNOW, SHE'S USED -SHE SAID
 ISRAEL WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WORLD
 IN A TWEET BEFORE SHE WAS IN
 OFFICE.
 SHE HAD THE BENJAMINS TWEET THAT
 YOU SHOWED THE AUDIENCE AT THE
 TOP OF THE SHOW.
 NOW, SHE HAS THIS.
 EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE HAS PLED
 IGNORANCE OF THESE TROPES.
 BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE TROPES FOR
 A REASON.
 SHE'S PICKING UP ON LANGUAGE
 THAT IS ANTI-SEMITIC, QUITE
 FRANKLY.
 I THINK NANCY PELOSI IS DOING
 WHAT SHE HAS VERY CAREFULLY
 DONE, SINCE THIS NEW CAUCUS HAS
 COME TOGETHER, WHICH IS TRY TO
 VERY CAREFULLY THREAD THAT
 NEEDLE AND TRY TO SEW THESE TWO
 VERY DISPIRIT GENERATIONS
 TOGETHER AND IT'S GETTING
 HARDER.
 BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
 SPEAKER PELOSI CAN DO.
 I MET WITH HOUSE DEMOCRATS,
 SEASONED VETERANS OVER THE LAST
 WEEK.
 THEY SAID IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF
 SOCIAL MEDIA, WHERE SOMEONE LIKE
 REPRESENTATIVE OMAR OR
 OCASIO-CORTEZ CAN HAVE
 MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS, THE OLD
 RULES DON'T APPLY.
 AND SO, SPEAKER PELOSI MAY TRY
 TO COBBLE TOGETHER LEGISLATION,
 TO SEND A MESSAGE TO VOTERS.
 BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
 POLITICAL CAPITAL INSIDE THIS
 PARTY, ARE THOSE WITH A SOCIAL
 MEDIA FOLLOWING.
 OKAY.
 IF YOU GET OFF SOCIAL MEDIA, THE
 WORLD LOOKS NORMAL.
 FAIRLY DIFFERENT.
 BUT IF YOU LIVE ON SOCIAL
 MEDIA -I MEAN, I DON'T MEAN TO
 CARRY THIS OVER.
 THE NBA IS HAVING A PROBLEM.
 ITS PLAYERS ARE MAKING ALL THIS
 MONEY AND THEY'RE DEPRESSED
 ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY LIVE
 ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND FEEL EVERY
 NEGATIVE COMMENT AND LIVE ALL OF
 IT.
 THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS
 YOUNGER GENERATION.
 AND PART OF IT, TOO, IS YOU
 DON'T KNOW WHO IS TWEETING YOU.
 ARE THEY BOTS OR REAL PEOPLE?
 WHEN IT COMES TO BASICALLY
 FEELING THIS.
 AND THE CHALLENGE IS, PRESIDENT
 TRUMP HAS REALLY DONE A
 FANTASTIC JOB, COMMUNICATING TO
 A BROADER AUDIENCE BASED ON HIS
 TWEETS.
 AND IT'S TOE-TO-TOE WITH A
 GENERATION THAT EXPECTS THEY'RE
 GOING TO HAVE THEIR BREAKING
 NEWS, NOT ON "THE NEW YORK
 TIMES," BUT THROUGH A TWEET.
 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO HAVE THE
 ACCURATE LITERACY IS THIS
 ACTUALLY LITERATE?
 THAT'S A CHALLENGE.
 AS A FORMER MAYOR AND
 GOVERNOR, I THOUGHT THAT
 RESOLUTIONS WITHOUT ACTIONS WERE
 EMPTY GESTURES.
 AND THIS RESOLUTION WAS AN EMPTY
 GESTURE, WHICH TRIED TO PLEASE
 EVERYONE AND ENDED UP PLEASING
 NO ONE.
 BUT THE PROBLEM FOR THE
 DEMOCRATS, WITH THESE NEW
 MILLENNIALS, I CALL THEM THE AOC
 MILLENNIALS, NOT ONLY DO THEY
 THINK THEY HAVE THE ANSWERS,
 THEY THINK THEY ALREADY HAVE
 WISDOM.
 AND THE NANCY PELOSI'S OF THE
 WORLD HAVE WISDOM.
 AND THEY ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN
 TO THE YOUNGER PEOPLE, WAIT, I'M
 THE OLD PERSON.
 AND YOU CANNOT MAKE THAT
 ARGUMENT.
 ARE YOU SURE?
 BRING IT ON.
 HERE YOU GO.
 BRING IT ON.
 HONESTLY, I THINK THE LEADERS
 CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE
 NEWER -I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT,
 YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE
 KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT
 AND I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,
 THERE ARE GOING TO BE
 CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME OF THE
 ACTIONS THEY TAKE ON SOCIAL
 MEDIA, IN THE UNIVERSE OF TRYING
 TO GET THINGS DONE.
 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK
 THE OLD GUARD DOESN'T REALLY
 UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF WHAT
 THEY BRING.
 BY THE WAY, GUYS, I WANT TO
 INSERT SOMEBODY INTO HERE REALLY
 QUICKLY.
 FIRST OF ALL, "THE TIMES" SET IT
 UP REALLY WELL.
 "THE TIMES" SAID, THIS IS A
 DEBATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 DO AMERICANS PINE FOR A
 PRE-TRUMP EQUILIBRIUM?
 OR DO THE YAWNING DISPARITIES OF
 THESE TIMES CALL OUT FOR A MORE
 TRANSFORMATIONAL ADMINISTRATION?
 THAT.
 ABSOLUTELY THAT.
 NOW, LISTEN TO AOC YESTERDAY.
 LISTEN TO THIS.
 MODERATE IS NOT A STANCE.
 IT'S JUST AN ATTITUDE TOWARD
 LIFE OF, LIKE --
 THE MEH IS LIKE WORSHIPED NOW
 FOR WHAT?
 I REST MY CASE.
 BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS
 THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT
 BROUGHT OUT THE AOC MILLENNIALS
 AGAINST THE TRADITIONAL LIBERAL
 DEMOCRATS.
 THAT WAS AMAZON.
 CUOMO, ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL
 MAYORS OF NEW YORK CITY WE'VE
 EVER HAD, GAVE TAX BREAKS TO A
 MAJOR MULTIBILLION DOLLAR
 COMPANY AND AOC FOUGHT IT.
 SHE SAID, WE CAN SPEND THAT
 $2 BILLION ELSEWHERE.
 THE $2 BILLION DIDN'T EXIST.
 SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE
 NECESSARY OF THE ECONOMY.
 NOW, PHILOSOPHY, THAT'S A GOOD
 ARGUMENT.
 THAT'S ALSO SHOWING THE DIVISION
 IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 I THINK THAT WHAT MILLENNIALS
 ARE FEELING IS THEY ARE FEELING
 FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE.
 THEY KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS OFF.
 THEY KNOW THEIR EXPERIENCE THAT
 THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A
 GUARANTEED BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN
 THEIR PARENTS IS NOT GOING TO
 HAPPEN.
 IT'S BROKEN.

 THE COMPACT IS BROKEN.
 IT USED TO BE IF YOU WORKED
 HARD AND YOU FOLLOWED THE ETHICS
 OF YOUR PARENTS, YOU WOULD END
 UP WORKING FOR A COMPANY THAT
 WOULD TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR A
 LONG TIME.
 THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.
 IT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE.
 IT'S BIGGER THAN AGE.
 THE POINT REPRESENTATIVE CORTEZ
 IS MAKING, IS THAT THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS TO MOVE
 TO THE LEFT.
 YOU LOOK AT THIS 2020
 PRESIDENTIAL RACE, WHERE IS THE
 ENERGY?
 FUND-RAISING, BERNIE SANDERS.
 CROWDS, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
 HE'S IN HIS UPPER 70s.
 YET, HE'S THE RUNNER-UP FROM '16
 AND HE'S SAYING TO PEOPLE LIKE
 THE REPRESENTATIVE OF NEW YORK,
 I'M YOUR TYPE OF CANDIDATE.
 I'M NOT A MEH CANDIDATE, TO USE
 HER TERM.
 IT TAKES TWO 75-PLUS-YEAR-OLD
 GUYS TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN
 THIS GENERATIONAL ARGUMENT HERE.
 ARE THEY PLACE HOLDERS FOR NOW
 UNTIL THE YOUNGER GENERATION
 GETS MORE GRASS ROOTS SUPPORT?
 I THINK THAT EVERYBODY IS
 WAITING IN THE WINGS IN LARGE
 PART BECAUSE THEY ARE WAITING
 FOR BETO TO ANNOUNCE.
 UNLIKE ALL OF THE OTHER
 DEMOCRATS THAT ARE TRYING TO
 MOVE AS FAR TO THE LEFT TO SAY
 YEAH, I'M YOUR PERSON, HE HAS
 NOT NECESSARILY SAID THAT HE IS.
 AND HE'S MORE PALATABLE TO THE
 INDEPENDENTS.
 AND HE'S DONE THAT IN AN
 INTERESTING WAY.
 IF YOU ASK HIM WHERE HIS
 POLICIES ARE, THEY'RE NOT ON THE
 LEFT.
 ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.
 IF THERE'S A CRITICISM ON
 BETO, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE
 STANDS ON A LOT OF THINGS.
 IF YOU READ HIS INTERVIEWS.
 ALL OF THE LEFT-WING STANCES,
 THE GREEN PLAN, WHERE THE
 MILLENNIALS REALIZE THEY HAVE TO
 HAVE ENERGY AND POWER AT AN
 AFFORDABLE PRICE, THEY WILL FIND
 OUT THAT ENERGY IS NOT CHEAP.
 YOU NEED ENERGY TO SURVIVE.
 AND THE REALITY IS GOING TO WAKE
 THEM UP SOME TIME.
 THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT
 NEEDS MORE TIME.
 AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT MORE
 TIME.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, PRESIDENT
 TRUMP SAYS MICHAEL COHEN IS
 LYING ABOUT ASKING FOR A PARDON.
 COHEN SAYS IT'S MR. TRUMP WHO IS
 LYING.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WHAT DOES ADAM SCHIFF THINK
 BECAUSE MICHAEL COHEN HAS LIED
 TO HIM, TOO.
 THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE JOINS ME
 NEXT.
      EE JOINS ME NEXT

 And then I need my phone to work     while I'm on the subway,
           or streaming      the video they sent me
  while I learn the choreography          as best I can.

         so that you have      full range of motion.

             THIS BED.
 WELCOME BACK. THIS WAS A WEEK IN WHICH WE SAW
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER
 CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT
 GET SENTENCED TO PRISON.
 THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT.
 THE MAN WHO MADE SURE DONALD
 TRUMP SECURED THE DOMINATION FOR
 THE PRESIDENCY, WAS SENTENCED TO
 47 MONTHS IN PRISON WITH
 SENTENCING IN ANOTHER CASE
 COMING THIS WEEK.
 WE SAW MR. TRUMP AND COHEN CALL
 EACH OTHER A LIAR, OVER WHETHER
 COHEN SOUGHT A PARDON FROM THE
 PRESIDENT.
 A LOT TO CHEW ON.
 WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO ADAM
 SCHIFF, WHO JOINS ME FROM LOS
 ANGELES.
 AND ON SPRING-FORWARD DAY I'M
 GRATEFUL FOR YOU GETTING UP THAT
 HOUR EARLIER.
 CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, WELCOME BACK
 TO "MEET THE PRESS," SIR.
 THANK YOU.
 LET ME START WITH A BASIC
 QUESTION HERE.
 WHO IS LYING?
 WHEN IT COMES TO MICHAEL COHEN
 ASKED FOR A PARDON.
 AND DID MICHAEL COHEN LIE TO
 CONGRESS AGAIN?
 WELL, THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF
 OUR INVESTIGATION IS, WHY DID
 MICHAEL COHEN LIE BEFORE OUR
 COMMITTEE ABOUT MOSCOW TRUMP
 TOWER?
 WHY WOULD THIS BE IN HIS
 INTEREST?
 WAS THIS SOMETHING THAT HE DID
 ALONE OR WERE THERE OTHERS
 INVOLVED IN IT?
 AND THERE ARE REASONS TO BELIEVE
 THAT THIS WAS NOT A LONE
 DECISION ON MICHAEL COHEN.
 WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS
 CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE.
 AND THE REASON WHY THIS WHOLE
 MOSCOW TRUMP TOWER ISSUE IS SO
 CENTRAL TO OUR INVESTIGATION IS,
 THAT IT EXPLAINS OR POTENTIALLY
 EXPLAINS THE PRESIDENT'S BIZARRE
 AFFINITY FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN.
 AND THAT IS, HE STOOD TO MAKE
 MORE MONEY FROM THIS TRANSACTION
 THAN ANY DEAL IN HIS LIFE.
 AND SOUGHT THE KREMLIN'S HELP TO
 MAKE THIS HAPPEN WHILE
 CONCEALING THIS FROM THE PUBLIC.
 THAT MAY BE AN ANIMATED
 PRINCIPLE FOR THE PRESIDENT.
 HE MAY BELIEVE THAT WHEN HE
 LEAVES OFFICE, HE STILL WANTS TO
 BUILD THIS TOWER.
 AND WHILE THAT MAY NOT BE
 CRIMINAL, IT IS NONETHELESS
 CORRUPT AND DISTORTS OUR
 POLICIES.
 THAT IS CERTAINLY THE CENTRAL
 QUESTION FOR US.
 IN TERMS OF WHO IS TELLING THE
 TRUTH BETWEEN MICHAEL COHEN AND
 THE PRESIDENT, WE KNOW THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAS MADE PROBABLY OVER
 1,000 FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE
 RUSSIA ISSUES.
 AND HERE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
 FIND WHAT CORROBORATION WE CAN
 TO FIND OUT WHERE THE TRUTH
 LIES.
 IS IT SAFE TO SAY YOU CAN'T
 TAKE MICHAEL COHEN ON HIS WORD
 ON ANYTHING?
 I DON'T THINK IN TERMS OF
 MAKING THE CASE TO THE PUBLIC --
 AND HERE, WE'RE NOT MAKING THE
 CASE TO A JURY ABOUT WHAT TOOK
 PLACE ON THAT WEEKEND AND RELY
 SOLELY ON THE TESTIMONY OF
 MICHAEL COHEN.
 WE'RE GOING TO NEED
 CORROBORATION.
 LOOKING AT WHAT MICHAEL COHEN
 SAID IN THE OPEN HEARING AND
 WHAT HIS LAWYER SAID AFTERWARDS,
 IT WAS LIKE WHAT DONALD TRUMP
 DID WHEN HE SAID HE HAD NO
 KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAYMENTS TO
 STORMY DANIELS.
 AND RUDY GIULIANI SAID, OH, YES,
 HE DID.
 WHERE IS THE TRUTH THERE?
 WE ASKED MICHAEL COHEN ABOUT
 THIS EXTENSIVELY.
 THOSE TRANSCRIPTS WILL BE MADE
 PUBLIC.
 THE PUBLIC CAN EVALUATE HIS
 CREDIBILITY THEMSELVES.
 YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE WE
 DON'T KNOW THIS FOR SURE, BUT IT
 LOOKS LIKE ROBERT MUELLER WILL
 COMPLETE HIS INVESTIGATION
 WITHOUT SUBPOENAING THE
 PRESIDENT BEFORE THE GRAND JURY
 OR COMING UP WITH A WAY TO HAVE
 HIM INTERVIEWED BEFORE THE GRAND
 JURY.
 PRESIDENT CLINTON WENT BEFORE
 KEN STARR'S GRAND JURY.
 IF, INDEED, MR. MUELLER DECIDES
 NOT TO ISSUE THAT SUBPOENA OR
 FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE
 PRESIDENT IN FRONT OF THAT GRAND
 JURY, IS THAT GOING TO HAVE BEEN
 A MISTAKE, CONSIDERING WE HAVE
 SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO'S
 TESTIMONY SHOULD YOU BELIEVE?
 MICHAEL COHEN'S OR DONALD
 TRUMP'S?
 YES, I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE.
 I SAID ALL ALONG THAT I DON'T
 THINK BOB MUELLER SHOULD RELY ON
 WRITTEN ANSWERS.
 WHEN YOU GET WRITTEN ANSWERS
 FROM A WITNESS, IT'S REALLY THE
 LAWYERS' ANSWERS AS MUCH AS THE
 CLIENT'S ANSWER.
 YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ASK
 FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS IN
 REALTIME.
 BUT I THINK THE CONSTRAINT THAT
 BOB MUELLER IS OPERATING UNDER,
 HE HAD AN ACTING ATTORNEY
 GENERAL WHO WAS APPOINTED
 BECAUSE HE WOULD BE HOSTILE TO A
 SUBPOENA ON THE PRESIDENT.
 AND NOW, HE HAS A PERMANENT
 ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS CHOSEN
 FOR THE SAME HOSTILITY TO HIS
 INVESTIGATION, WHO WOULD LIKELY
 OPPOSE THAT STEP.
 I ALSO THINK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 FEELS SOME TIME PRESSURE TO
 CONCLUDE HIS WORK AND KNOWING
 THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD DRAG OUT A
 FIGHT OVER THE SUBPOENA.
 THAT MAY BE AN ISSUE, AS WELL.
 I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S A
 MISTAKE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE
 BEST WAY TO GET THE TRUTH WOULD
 BE TO PUT THE PRESIDENT UNDER
 OATH.
 AS HE'S MADE PLAIN IN THE PAST,
 HE FEELS IT'S FINE TO LIE TO THE
 PUBLIC AFTER ALL HE HAS SAID,
 IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TALKING BEFORE
 A MAGISTRATE.
 MAYBE HE SHOULD TALK BEFORE
 A IMAGE STRAIGHT.
 I WANT TO MOVE TO SOMETHING
 THAT WAS A BIT CONFUSING.
 ERIK PRINCE, THE BROTHER OF THE
 SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, BUT ALSO
 HAS BEEN BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE,
 HAVING TO DO WITH SOME ODD
 MEETINGS HE SET UP IN THE
 SEYCHELLES.
 HE WAS ON AL-JAZEERA AND HE WAS
 ASKED ABOUT SOME TESTIMONY TO
 YOUR COMMITTEE AND ABOUT WHETHER
 HE LIED OR NOT.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 WE'RE THERE TO TALK ABOUT
 IRAN POLICY.
 THERE TO TALK ABOUT IRAN
 POLICY?
 ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE
 TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE UNDER
 OATH?
 I DID.
 THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE
 TRUMP TOWER MEETING IN 2016.
 WHY NOT?
 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY GOT THE
 TRANSCRIPT WRONG.
 SO, THIS WAS ABOUT ANOTHER
 MEETING THAT ERIK PRINCE HAD, I
 BELIEVE WITH SOME OTHER
 REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER
 COUNTRIES, IN TRUMP TOWER, THE
 SECOND SO-CALLED TRUMP TOWER
 MEETING OF LESS SIGNIFICANCE,
 NOT WITH RUSSIANS BUT WITH OTHER
 FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
 BASED ON WHAT YOU HEARD THERE,
 IS MR. PRINCE TELLING THE TRUTH?
 IS YOUR TRANSCRIPT WRONG?
 HE'S NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ON
 THAT INTERVIEW.
 THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH
 OUR TRANSCRIPT.
 THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE
 REPORTER WHO TRANSCRIBED HIS
 TESTIMONY.
 HE DID NOT DISCLOSE THAT MEETING
 TO OUR COMMITTEE.
 AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE
 PUBLISHED TRANSCRIPT OF HIS
 INTERVIEW, HE WAS ASKED WHAT
 KIND OF ROLE HE PLAYED, IF ANY,
 IN THE CAMPAIGN, AND HE SAID HE
 HAD NO ROLE, APART FROM ON HIS
 OWN SUBMITTING WRITTEN PAPERS,
 HANGING A YARD SIGN OR MAKING A
 CONTRIBUTION.
 AND HE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT ANY
 SUBSTANTIVE POLICY CONVERSATIONS
 THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD.
 SO, HIS INTERVIEW WAS CERTAINLY
 LOOKS INCONSISTENT WITH HIS
 TESTIMONY.
 BOB MUELLER HAS THAT TESTIMONY
 ALREADY.
 AND BOB MUELLER WILL HAVE TO
 MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER
 THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF
 DELIBERATE FALSEHOOD.
 WE HAD QUESTIONS AT THE TIME OF
 HIS TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS CANDOR
 AND HOW FORTHCOMING HE WAS AND
 THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN
 HEIGHTENED NOW.
 WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN ABOUT
 WHAT HE WAS DOING?
 THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS
 ANOTHER CONCEALED MEETING.
 ANOTHER DISCUSSION THAT TOOK
 PLACE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
 MEETING THAT HE HAD IN THE
 SEYCHELLES.
 THERE HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT
 QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE UAE
 WAS PLAYING A BACK CHANNEL ROLE
 TO THE RUSSIANS DURING THE
 CAMPAIGN.
 AND THOSE WERE A LOT OF THE
 QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE ASKING
 HIM ABOUT.
 CLEARLY, THIS MEETING AT TRUMP
 TOWER WITH THESE PLAYERS, WAS OF
 DIRECT INTEREST TO OUR
 COMMITTEE.
 SO, WHY CONCEAL IT?
 WHY WITHHOLD THAT INFORMATION IF
 THERE WAS NOTHING IMPROPER, NO
 IMPROPER PURPOSE IN IT?
 THERE ARE A LOT OF DEEPLY
 CONCERNING AND UNANSWERED
 QUESTIONS SURROUNDING ERIK
 PRINCE AND HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH
 THE CAMPAIGN.
 ALL RIGHT.
 ADAM SCHIFF, I WILL LEAVE IT
 THERE.
 THE DEMOCRATIC LEAD ON THE HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, THE
 CHAIRMAN.
 THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON,
 GETTING UP EARLY AND SHARING
 YOUR VIEWS WITH US THIS MORNING.
 THANK YOU.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, THE STATE
 THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ON THEIR
 MINDS FOR 2020.
 COULD IT BE THE GAME CHANGER
 THAT GETS THEM OVER 270?
         <i> We humans are</i>       <i> strange creatures.</i>

     <i> Built for the strangest</i>        <i> of all creatures.</i>
 WELCOME BACK. "DATA DOWNLOAD" TIME.
 HEADING INTO THE 2020 ELECTION,
 DEMOCRATS ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE
 OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ELECTORAL
 PICKUP.
 IT'S NOT TEXAS.
 IT'S NOT ARIZONA.
 BUT GEORGIA.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 A STATE THAT HASN'T VOTED FOR A
 DEMOCRAT FOR PRESIDENT SINCE
 BILL CLINTON IN 1992.
 LET'S LOOK TO COBB COUNTY, WHAT
 A SUBURB OF ATLANTA.
 NEWT GINGRICH REPRESENTED AND
 THE RAPIDLY CHANGING POLITICS IN
 THE LAST FEW YEARS.
 IN 2012, COBB COUNTY VOTED FOR
 REPUBLICAN MITT ROMNEY FOR
 PRESIDENT FOR A WHOPPING 12
 POINTS.
 FOUR YEARS LATER IT SWUNG TO
 HILLARY CLINTON AND SHE WON THE
 COUNTY BY TWO POINTS.
 BEFORE YOU SAY, THAT'S JUST A
 DONALD TRUMP ANOMALY, REALIZE
 THAT THIS PAST NOVEMBER, STACEY
 ABRAMS, THE DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR WON COBB
 COUNTY BY NEARLY TEN POINTS.
 SO A 22 POINT SWING IN JUST SIX
 YEARS.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WE WENT DOWN TO COBB COUNTY TO
 FIGURE IT OUT.
 IT'S CHANGING IN COBB COUNTY.
 IT WAS ONCE MORE REPUBLICANS.
 NOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF MOVE-INS
 AND IT'S GETTING A MIXTURE NOW.
 GEORGIA IS BECOMING A MIXTURE.
 YOU KNOW?
 I SORT OF LIKE THE REPUBLICAN
 PART OF IT.
 IT'S TRUE.
 COBB COUNTY HAS SEEN A TON OF
 PEOPLE MOVE IN THE LAST FEW
 YEARS.
 BETWEEN 2010 AND 2017, COBB
 COUNTY'S POPULATION GREW 9.8%,
 OUTPACING GROWTH IN GEORGIA AS A
 WHOLE.
 IN THAT SAME TIME, COBB COUNTY
 HAS GROWN MORE DIVERSE.
 WITH INCREASES TO THE
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC
 POPULATIONS.
 MORE RESIDENTS HAVE COLLEGE
 DEGREES AND MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD
 INCOME HAS GONE FROM $66,000 TO
 $72,000 PER YEAR.
 THE MORE TELLING DATA MAY BE
 WHERE THE TRANSPLANTS TO COBB
 COUNTY ARE COMING FROM.
 OF THE TOP 20 COUNTIES THAT
 PEOPLE MOVE TO COBB FROM, SINCE
 2012, 13 ARE FROM OUTSIDE THE
 STATE OF GEORGIA.
 AND 15 OF THOSE COUNTIES VOTED
 FOR HILLARY CLINTON, INCLUDING
 QUEENS, NEW YORK, L.A. COUNTY
 AND MIAMI-DADE.
 THIS IS JUST COBB COUNTY, OF
 COURSE.
 BUT YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THE
 CHANGES IN THE OTHER SUBURBAN
 COUNTIES, WHERE THE VOTE HAS
 ALSO SWUNG TOWARDS THE DEMOCRATS
 IN AND AROUND ATLANTA.
 SO, IS GEORGIA READY TO BE A
 SWING STATE AGAIN?
 THE YOUNGER CROWD IS
 DEFINITELY GOING TO GO TOWARDS
 THIS.
 I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT A
 PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE CAN WIN
 STATEWIDE.
 I THINK GEORGIA HAS BEEN A
 SWING STATE BEFORE.
 I THINK IT'S MOVING TOWARDS THAT
 WAY AGAIN.
 I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT BEING A
 RED STATE.
 I REALLY CAN'T.
 WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.
 COMING UP, PAUL MANAFORT, A
 CONTROVERSIAL SENTENCE AND THAT
 CLAIM THAT HE'S LIVED AN
 OTHERWISE BLAMELESS LIFE.

 PROTECT, CONNECT BACK,  NOW WITH END GAME.
 DES MOINES REGISTER WITH THE
 DEMOCRATIC DIVIDE.
 WE SHOULD HURRY UP AND GET A
 POLL IN HERE.
 LET ME PUT UP THE DES MOINES
 REGISTER POLL.
                MEANINGFUL AND M AT THE SAME TIME.
 WE SEE WHO THE TOP TWO
 CANDIDATES ARE, BIDEN AND
 SANDERS.
 WARREN AT 9, AND HARRIS AT 7,
 RIGHT BELOW HARRIS IS BETO AT 5.
 BOOKER AND KLOBUCHAR, OVER 1%.
 WHAT IS TELLING THERE, YOU CAN
 TELL THAT BUZZ IS EVERYTHING.
 BERNIE'S NUMBERS WENT UP SIX
 POINTS FROM THE LAST TIME.
 AND WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
 BETWEEN THIS TIME AND THE LAST
 TIME?
 BERNIE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN
 ANNOUNCEMENT TOUR.
 AND SANDERS IS RUNNING AS A
 MOVEMENT POLITICIAN.
 HE'S GOTTEN RID OF HIS
 CONSULTANTS.
 HE'S BUILT A MOVEMENT FROM HIS
 2016 CAMPAIGN.
 AND SENATOR WARREN HAS A
 MESSAGE.
 BREAK UP THE BIG COMPANIES, GO
 AFTER TECH.
 IT'S A CROWDED SPACE ON THAT
 LEFT SIDE OF THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY.
 YOU KNOW, CHUCK, ONE OF THE
 MOST INTERESTING THINGS IN THAT
 POLL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS
 FOR BIDEN, THE BIGGEST CHUNK OF
 THEM, IF YOU ASK WHO THE SECOND
 CHOICE IS, THE ANSWER IS BERNIE
 SANDERS, WHICH IS PRETTY
 REMARKABLE.
 I DO THINK --
 I THOUGHT SO, TOO.
 THEY'RE THE MAINSTREAM OF THE
 PARTY, THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER.
 POTENTIALLY, YES.
 AND BERNIE SANDERS' FUND-RAISING
 MEANS THAT HE IS GOING TO BE A
 FACTOR.
 HE HAS A CORE OF SUPPORTERS.
 I'M NOT SURE IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO
 WIN HIM BIG STATES.
 BUT IF HE POLLS 20%, 25%
 CONSISTENTLY, HE WILL HAVE THE
 MONEY TO GO THE DISTANCE.
 MARK MY WORDS, YOU WILL SEE HIM
 AT THE CONVENTION.
 BERNIE SANDERS IS ONE OF THE
 FEW PEOPLE, HE NEVER STOPS
 CAMPAIGNING.
 HE DOES FACEBOOK LIVES WHERE HE
 HAS 30,000 PEOPLE WATCHING AND
 FOLLOWING HIM.
 HE REALLY APPEALS TO YOUNG
 VOTERS.
 FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME YOUNG
 VOTERS ARE GOING TO OUTWEIGH,
 POTENTIALLY, THE MILLENNIALS --
 EXCUSE ME, THE BABY BOOMERS.
 THEY WILL HAVE MORE ELIGIBLE
 VOTERS.
 THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO
 APOLOGIZE AND DO A RESOLUTION,
 BASED ON WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE
 MILLENNIALS.
 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS, THE
 MORE THE CANDIDATES GET OUT,
 WE'LL SEE TRUMP NUMBERS GO UP
 BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A
 COMPARISON.
 IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING.
 AND THE MORE CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF
 TALKS ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS, AND
 CONTINUING THESE INVESTIGATIONS,
 AFTER THE MUELLER REPORT, I
 THINK TRUMP NUMBERS WILL GO UP.
 I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING
 TO PUT TRUMP IN OFFICE.
 SPEAKING OF THE PRESIDENT, I
 WANT TO PLAY WHAT HE SAID ABOUT
 PAUL MANAFORT BECAUSE THERE'S A
 PART OF THE EMPATHY I REALLY
 DON'T GET WHEN IT COMES TO
 BECOME THE SITTING PRESIDENT OF
 THE UNITED STATES.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 I FEEL VERY BADLY FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY, VERY
 TOUGH TIME FOR HIM.
 BUT IF YOU NOTICE, BOTH HIS
 LAWYER, A HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN,
 AND A HIGHLY RESPECTED JUDGE,
 THE JUDGE, SAID THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
 WELL, THE JUDGE DID NOT SAY
 THAT, THOUGH THE JUDGE DID SAY
 THIS ABOUT MANAFORT, I THINK
 THIS SENTENCING RANGE IS
 EXCESSIVE.
 HE'S BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO
 OTHERS.
 WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY
 THE PRESIDENT IS PRAISING AND
 FEELING SORRY FOR A MAN WHO
 DEFRAUDED AMERICAN TAXPAYERS FOR
 AT LEAST $6 MILLION.
 YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WONDERS
 THAT?
 MANY TRUMP ADVISERS.
 THEY WISH THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE
 QUIET ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT.
 THEY WISH JUDGE ELLIS OF
 ALEXANDRIA WOULD BE THEIR
 SPOKESMAN.
 COULD HAVE BEEN.
 HE IS MAKING THE BEST CASE
 FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION.
 THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF OUT AS
 THE COMMUNICATIONS HEAD.
 THE PRESIDENT GOING ON AND ON,
 TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLE PARDONS.
 THEY WISH ALL OF THAT WOULD JUST
 BE NOISE.
 IT'S TELL LIS CASE, DIMINISHING
 THE MUELLER PROBE.
 THAT'S WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE
 WANTS.
 THERE'S A VIDEO RIGHT NOW, OF
 A WHALE ALMOST SWALLOWING A
 PERSON SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN.
 AND HE SPITS HIM OUT.
 TRUMP NEEDS TO SPIT MANAFORT
 OUT.
 AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE NEEDS TO
 GET RID OF COHEN.
 STAY AWAY FROM BOTH OF THEM.
 THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR EITHER
 PARTY.
 I THINK WE NEED TO CLARIFY
 THAT WHAT HE WAS GETTING
 SENTENCED FOR WAS RUSSIAN
 COLLUSION.
 IT WAS RIPPING OFF THE
 AMERICAN GOVERNMENT OF 30 YEARS
 OF LOBBYING.
 ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT
 PEOPLE ARE HAVING IS HOW UNJUST
 THE SENTENCE WAS FOR THIS CRIME.
 IF WE LOOK AT THIS JUDGE, THIS
 JUDGE THREW THE BOOK AT
 REPRESENTATIVE JEFFERSON FROM
 LOUISIANA.
 AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN DEMOCRAT
 FROM NEW ORLEANS.
 HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE
 EMBEZZLED $400,000.
 THE FREEZER CASUAL.
 THE FREEZER CASH.
 IT WAS SO MUCH LOWER THAN
 WHAT PAUL MANAFORT IS DEALING
 WITH.
 IS THERE A JUSTICE WHEN IT
 COMES TO WHITE COLLAR CRIME.
 HE WAS TEETERING ON TREASON WHEN
 IT COMES TO THIS.
 WAS THAT FAIR?
 THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO UNPACK
 THE SENTENCE THAT HE WAS GIVEN.
 THERE'S MORE SENTENCING
 COMING FOR MR. MANAFORT.
 THE SPINAL TAP DRUMMER
 COMMISSION AT THE WHITE HOUSE --
 I MEAN THE COMMUNICATIONS
 DIRECTOR POSITION AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE --
 THERE'S SOME INSIGHT.
 I LOVE IT.
 HE BROUGHT UP BILL SHINE.
 YOU WANT TO BE THE
 COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR?
 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, KASIE?
 TO BOB'S EARLIER POINT, WE'RE
 GOING TO SEE MORE OF THE SAME.
 YOU KNOW, I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T
 WANT TO BE THE PERSON THAT NEEDS
 TO TELL THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES HOW TO COMMUNICATE
 WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 GOOD LUCK.
 HE'S BEEN DOING IT HIS ENTIRE
 LIFE.
 HOW MUCH DID "THE NEW YORKER"
 PIECE HAVE TO DO WITH SHINE'S
 RELEASE?
 THE PRESIDENT WAS FRUSTRATED
 WITH BILL SHINE, NOT BRINGING
 THE FOX NEWS EXPERTISE.
 MOST REVEALING OF THE MOST
 RECENT WEEKS, PRESIDENT TRUMP AT
 CPAC, TWO HOURS.
 VOLUME AT 11 FOR PRESIDENT
 TRUMP DURING THE SPEECH.
 THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR TODAY.
 THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
 THANK YOU FOR SPRINGING FORWARD
 WITH US.
 WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK BECAUSE
 IF IT'S SUNDAY, NO MATTER THE
 HOUR, IT'S "MEET THE PRESS."
      I've always been amazed          by what's next.
   And still going for my best,
      even though I live with      a higher risk of stroke
     due to Afib not caused by      a heart valve problem.
 So if there's a better treatment         than warfarin...
         I want that too.
             ELIQUIS.
         ELIQUIS is proven
       to reduce stroke risk       better than warfarin.
    Plus has significantly less
   major bleeding than warfarin.
      ELIQUIS is FDA-approved           and has both.
           What's next?
      Reeling in a nice one.
    <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i>
 <i>as stopping increases your risk</i>       <i> of having a stroke.</i>
  <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i>  <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i>
  <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i>    <i> an artificial heart valve</i>
      <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>
      <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>    <i> you may bruise more easily</i>
   <i> and it may take longer than</i> <i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i>
   <i> Seek immediate medical care</i>   <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i>
      <i> like unusual bruising.</i>
    <i> ELIQUIS may increase your</i>          <i> bleeding risk</i>
  <i> if you take certain medicines.</i>
         <i> Tell your doctor</i>    <i> about all planned medical</i>
      <i> or dental procedures.</i>
      ELIQUIS, the number one
      cardiologist-prescribed          blood thinner.
    Ask your doctor if ELIQUIS
      is what's next for you.
   Guys do whatever it takes to   deal with shave irritation.
 So, we re-imagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuard.
      It has a unique guard      between the blades.
   That's designed to reduce   irritation during the shave.
  Because we believe all men  deserve a razor just for them.
     The best a man can get.
            Gillette.
           I don't keep         track of regrets.
          And I don't add           up the years.
     But what I do count on...
             is BOOST®
      <i> Delicious BOOST® High</i>    <i> Protein Nutritional Drink</i>
     <i> has 20 grams of protein,</i>
     <i> along with 26 essential</i>      <i> vitamins and minerals.</i>
       <i> BOOST® High Protein.</i>
         <i> Be Up for Life.</i>
