    My son Forest, he was born
  while my husband was deployed.
         I video chatted        the entire birth.
    I had great connectivity.
        His entire platoon    was standing next to him.
 They kept telling me, "You gotta      push! You gotta push!"
   They all got to meet Forest,          all together.
