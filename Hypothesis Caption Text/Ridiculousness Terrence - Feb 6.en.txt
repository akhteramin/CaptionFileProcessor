You're going to fall right into place.

Yeah, just connect, and get right back to the real world and your [bleep]-ass apartment.

Yep.

And [bleep] like-
You know what I'm saying? I believe in love on TV.
I've seen it happen.
I believe it can happen.

He's the worst, man.

Man.

He doesn't give a [bleep].
All-that's why he won, right? 
Yeah, I won.

Because he was like, it didn't matter what it was.

I was just out of college, flew to New York.
There was a line of 1,000 people.
I was like, number 700.
I was nervous, I was tired.
They gave you this paper, and you had to read off of it.
And I was just really bad.
I was inexperienced.
So my boy, he hyped me up.
For real, he was like, yo, let's just go to the next audition.
So when we drove from New York to Atlanta, I knew what to expect.
