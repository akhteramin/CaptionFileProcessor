putting you on the spot. Either you want to be-
- 
- It means tend my garden. 
- Okay. 
- You know. 
- Yeah. I don't have many experiences, so I don't know if I could tend the garden. 
- Me neither. Um, yeah, so you can be my gardener. 
- Oh, okay. 
- You can plant some seeds. 
- All right. 
- Um... it's a sexual innuendo. 
- Yeah. Shaun, did you undress me? Except your underpants. How long have you been here? All night. You should be at work. I'm taking the day off. No, you should be at work. You're sick all the time, not just after hours. Shaun, you shouldn't give up your life. You have my number. You check in with me. I have 15 paid vacation days and 10 sick days per year, but I can only take sick days when I'm sick, not when you are, so this is a vacation. [ Sighs ] The plan is to align your eyes using what's called distraction osteogenesis. We cut the bone and implant posts on either side of your eye orbits. Then we slowly expand that distance, allowing for new bone to grow in the gaps. Molly: Will it hurt? Mm, for mere mortals it would, but with your pain tolerance, it'll tickle. You up for this? So I'll have perfectly aligned eyes but still look like a wad of chewing gum. Molly... You lost an awful lot of bone and soft tissue in the accident, and in terms of facial reconstruction, we've actually come a long way in the past two years. Claire: And after 12 surgeries, you get your own personalized coffee mug. Oh, I forgot about that. Okay, when can we get prepped? Is now too soon? [ Chuckles ] Car accident. Karin Tindle, 14. She was sleeping in the back. Trucker in the oncoming lane fell asleep. She wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Head trauma, not responsive, GCS of 5 with decorticate posturing. Morgan: Sounds like a bleed in the brain. And she has a 25-point difference in blood pressures between her arms. -Possible aortic dissection. -Head and heart. Lim: Page Dr. Melendez. Have him meet us in the O.R. Have you contacted Karin's father? He passed away three years ago. Let's go. Why isn't she waking up? We're gonna take good care of her. --<font color=#ffff00> Captions by VITAC</font> -
- Park: CT confirmed an aortic dissection. She needs a thoracotomy. Aorta hasn't ruptured yet... And she has a pseudoaneurysm. We need to get after her head trauma first. I don't see any major brain bleeds and we can monitor pressures. In this case, the heart trumps the head. Okay. I have two major symptoms -
- nausea and boredom. I didn't know boredom was a symptom of chemotherapy. It's a symptom of sitting on my ass all day. I used to run a 700-bed hospital with a staff of thousands. Now all I have to think about is how I keep my food down and how many bowel movements I've had all week. Four. And I don't have to think about that. You know what I need? My meds. Will you do me a favor and run and pick these up? When I come back, we can do Mad Libs. Melendez: Unclamp. Graft is holding. Lim: That's one fire out. Drill. Morgan: Pupils are blown. Park: ICPs are spiking way up, brain perfusion CPP is down. She needs a hemicraniectomy. Let's sit her up. It's marijuana. Yes, it is. It's marijuana. Medicinal marijuana. Hold on. One...for the boredom. One for the nausea. Can I try one? I met someone who said cannabidiol improved his ASD symptoms. <i> A</i> person? You met a person once? Shaun, have you heard of the scientific method? I'd like to perform a practical, albeit anecdotal, experiment. Since you're on vacation... and we can keep an eye out on each other... One. One. Uh, whoa. One. Take one. Lim: Cruciate wide incision of the dura. -Brain edema. -She's bradycardic. Push another 50 grams of Mannitol and ventilate down her CO2. Morgan: No corneal reflex. No overbreathing vent. No brain stem reflexes. She's brain-dead. [ Sighs ] [ Monitor beeping, ventilator hissing ] Before we start

We have a 16-year-old girl who had a tragic accident a couple of years ago that destroyed her face. And we were hoping that you might -

There are still 28 stores in the greater San Jose area that we can try and I've devised a route starting in the south working counterclockwise around the city to best avoid traffic. We'll buy you a box, I promise. Okay, guys, I, uh, like a big fare as much as the next driver but racking up hundreds of dollars on a munchie quest is starting to feel exploitative.

Robin Demayne. Senior year in high school. Her favorite snack. [ Sighs ] Okay. Are we going to get Mallomars? Nope. You have been harboring feelings for this girl for over 40 years. <i> That</i> is a worthy quest. Now, how do you spell Demayne? D-E? You're the same sex, race, approximate age, share compatible blood types and antigens, and a whole bunch of other things that make you the perfect match.

You realize how stupid this is, right? This is a quest. A quest is never stupid. A quest is, by definition, almost always stupid. Why would I want to see Robin Demayne after all these years? To tell her you love her? I just want a cookie! I wasn't in love with her. I was a teenager. I was infatuated. And whenever you thought about her, it made you happy. And you thought about her all the time. And every time you saw her, you felt a rush, light-headed... Is that how you know you're in love? That's how it starts. And when you're not with that person, you miss them so much you're willing to drive to 32 stores to find a sensory reminder that might bring back those memories.

Yeah, it is. It's also very scary and natural to be having second thoughts. It's just... I-I don't know how to accept a gift like this... Someone else's face, someone else's identity...

I can just suck up my endometriosis pain... Or I can... I can keep apologizing... Or I can... I can hope my pain gets better on its own... Or I can talk to my gynecologist today! You didn't choose to have endometriosis... but you can choose to ask if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA is specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. In clinical trials, ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 common types of endometriosis pain, painful periods, pelvic pain in between periods, and pain with sex. Don't use ORILISSA if you are or may be pregnant, have osteoporosis, severe liver disease, or are taking drugs like cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. It may cause abnormal liver tests. ORILISSA may change your periods, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. It does not prevent pregnancy. Use birth control that does not contain hormones. ORILISSA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. It may also cause bone loss. Ask your gynecologist if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA. Made for endo pain. Julie means more to me than anything.

I need more interrupted sutures. Let's keep our focus, people. Nurse Petringa: Dr. Browne, Molly's parents would like to see you on your next break. Take it now. You, too. Uh... Dr. Park? I had a huge crush on Robin Demayne. A thoroughly unrequited crush... that slowly turned into a grudge. Last day of school, kids were passing around their yearbooks, and I signed in hers something that was borne out of anger and resentment and pettiness. It was designed to be somewhat humorous, but... was really just mostly hurtful. Later that day, at the award ceremony, I was skimming through my yearbook and saw what she wrote me... I have only two regrets -
- my haircut in junior year and that you never asked me out. And just then, I looked out in the crowd and saw her. Her eyes were red, obviously crying, obviously very hurt. And at that exact moment, I was awarded my trophy. I looked for her after but never saw her again. Is that all the scary, messy, embarrassing stuff that guys never, ever tell anyone? Pretty much. [ Car door opens ] Dean and Lori? This is Shannon. Lori: Thank you for meeting with us. And for... everything. Dean: If you don't mind, we have so many questions for you, about your daughter. We'd like to know what she was like, what she liked to do. Molly wants to know, too. Uh... Her name was Karin. And I killed her. I'm supposed to tell you to get back in. Don't let him get to you. It's not him, it's you. Your advice that I shouldn't be second-guessing myself is making me think you must be second-guessing yourself. About what? You're the one who insisted we deal with the heart before the brain. And you didn't fight me. Why not? Because you were right. I was right. But you have never thought anyone other than yourself was right in an O.R. since you first stepped foot in one. You backed off 'cause we're sleeping together. The car accident was my fault. It was my idea to leave so early. It was my idea to let her sleep in the back. It was up to me to make sure she was wearing her seatbelt. Claire: None of which would've mattered if the truck driver hadn't fallen asleep. It's natural to feel guilt, but you have to understand this wasn't your fault. It doesn't work that way, Dr. Browne. It was my handgun that hurt Molly. And you can say that it was a freak accident or that Molly knew she wasn't supposed to touch it or some other B.S., but... it was my fault. I had one job... ...and that was to protect my family. I didn't do my job. And you could try to make sense of it, try to find something, some pleasure somewhere, some meaning. But there just isn't. And then your daughter... ...does this for us... [ Sighs ] Hi, Robin. Aaron? Not much here, except the usual. What if we spice things up a bit? Alexa...

Yeah, well, it was a long time ago. Anyway, I just -

Like you're looking at a stranger. But it won't always. Because nobody laughs or holds their head or looks someone in the eye exactly the way you do. [ Quietly ] Okay. [ Door opens ] I apologize for telling you how to react to losing a patient. Thank you. When I accused you of second-guessing yourself, that's because I'm doing it, too. Our relationship has me questioning everything I do and everything you do. You're making this way more complicated than it has to be. It is complicated. The fact that we're seeing each other changes the context of all of our interactions. I guess that's why there are rules against it. I think I can keep being a jerk to you at work if that's what you want. You think we should end it? No. See you tomorrow. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Bag zips ] Claire: So, once you're feeling a little less woozy, we'll set you up with a whole bunch of therapists -
- speech, occupational, physical. Lori: Shannon. Please come in. Shannon: I'm Karin's mom. Hi. I brought something for you. [ Sighs ] She was beautiful. Thank you. And thank you for timing that elevator ride so perfectly. [ Exhales ] Can I ask you for a favor? I'd like to say goodbye. [ Door opens ] Glassman: Eh, we'll clean up tomorrow. Shaun: And buy a new vase. Yeah, buying a new vase is easy. Vacuuming up my grandmother's ashes, not so easy. Are you glad you apologized? Yeah. Do you still feel guilty? Yeah. Guilt must be a bad thing if it makes people feel badly about something they can never fix. Or maybe it's a deterrent so we do the right thing the next time. You loved Robin but could never be with her. Do you wish you'd never met her? Not for one second. I'm not okay that Lea is into Jake. Good night, Smurf. Night, Glassy.
