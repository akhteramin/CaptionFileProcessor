Ok, let's huff and puff. Like you do sometimes, Grandpa? Well, when you have COPD, it can be hard to breathe. So my doctor said... SYMBICORT can help you breathe better
- starting within 5 minutes. It doesn't replace a rescue inhaler for sudden symptoms. SYMBICORT helps provide significant improvement of your lung function. SYMBICORT is for COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It should not be taken more than twice a day. It may increase your risk of lung infections, osteoporosis, and some eye problems. Tell your doctor if you have a heart condition or high blood pressure before taking it. SYMBICORT could mean a day with better breathing. Watch out, piggies! Ask your doctor if SYMBICORT is right for you. If you can't afford your medication, AstraZeneca may be able to help. If you can't afford your medication, Ready for a lash lift?

[Music] OzempicÂ®! [Music] People with type 2 diabetes are excited about the potential of once-weekly OzempicÂ®. In a study with OzempicÂ®, a majority of adults lowered their blood sugar and reached an A1C of less than seven and maintained it. Oh! Under seven? And you may lose weight. In the same one-year study, adults lost on average up to 12 pounds. Oh! Up to 12 pounds? A two-year study showed that OzempicÂ® does not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events like heart attack, stroke, or death. Oh! No increased risk? [Music] Oh, oh, oh, OzempicÂ®! [Music] OzempicÂ® should not be the first medicine for treating diabetes, or for people with type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. Do not share needles or pens. Don't reuse needles. Do not take OzempicÂ® if you have a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome type 2, or if you are allergic to OzempicÂ®. Stop taking OzempicÂ® and get medical help right away if you get a lump or swelling in your neck, severe stomach pain, itching, rash, or trouble breathing. Serious side effects may happen, including pancreatitis. Tell your doctor if you have diabetic retinopathy or vision changes. Taking OzempicÂ® with a sulfonylurea or insulin may increase the risk for low blood sugar. Common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and constipation. Some side effects can lead to dehydration, which may worsen kidney problems. I discovered the potential with OzempicÂ®. [Music] Oh! Oh! Oh! OzempicÂ®! [Music] Ask your healthcare provider if OzempicÂ® is right for you.
