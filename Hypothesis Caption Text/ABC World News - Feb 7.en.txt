 THE PASSENGER JET DID NOT TAKE

 DETAINED THE AMERICAN AIRLINES
 FLIGHT CREW MEMBER IN MANCHESTER
 BEFORE THE A-330 TOOK OFF FOR

 AN AVIATION SOURCE TELLING ABC

 PILOTS, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR IF IT
 WAS THE CAPTAIN OR ONE OF THE
 FIRST OFFICERS WHO TONIGHT IS
 BEING INVESTIGATED FOR
 "SUSPICION OF PERFORMING AN
 AVIATION FUNCTION WHEN OVER THE
 PRESCRIBED LIMIT OF ALCOHOL."
 AMERICAN CANCELED THAT FLIGHT,
 REBOOKING PASSENGERS AND SAYING
 IN A STATEMENT, "SAFETY IS OUR
 HIGHEST PRIORITY AND WE
 APOLOGIZE TO OUR CUSTOMERS."
 THE LIMIT FOR ALCOHOL IN PILOTS
 IS HALF THAT FOR DRIVERS, .04.
 THIS PILOT ARRESTED TWO YEARS
 AGO IN DETROIT.
 AND SOME LIKE THIS FORMER
 JETBLUE PILOT FACED FEDERAL
 CHARGES.
 DID YOU PUT 270 PASSENGERS AT
 RISK?
 NO COMMENT.
 THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE
 YOU'VE REPORTED ON BEFORE.
 DAVID KERLEY WITH US TONIGHT.
 WE'RE AWARE OF THIS LATEST
 ARREST, AND HAS AMERICAN
 AIRLINES TAKEN ANY ACTION, OTHER
 THAN CANCELING THE FLIGHT,

 MANAGING EDITOR OF THE 1968
 YEARBOOK OF THE VIRGINIA

 BLACKFACE AND CONTAINED RACIAL
 SLURS.
 SENATOR, DO YOU REGRET WHAT'S IN

 IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN ALL
 LEARN FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE
 IN VIRGINIA THE LAST FEW DAYS?
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
 ANYTHING THAT WE ALL CAN LEARN,
 BUT I WILL SAY THAT PROBABLY IN
 THE NEWS MEDIA, YOU'RE SMARTER
 WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE REARVIEW
 MIRROR.

 Reporter: THIS TERRIFYING
 SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWING
 ELIZABETH BARRAZA'S
 EXECUTION-STYLE MURDER HAS

 SETTING UP A GARAGE SALE IN HER
 OWN DRIVEWAY.
 THAT SUSPECT, SHOOTING BARRAZA
 FOUR TIMES AT POINT BLANK RANGE
 EARLY IN THE MORNING ON
 JON 25th, THEN RUNNING AWAY ON
 FOOT BEFORE DRIVING OFF IN THIS
 DARK-COLORED TRUCK.
 POLICE SAY IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER
 BARRAZA WAS TARGETED.
 SHE HAD ONLY PUT OUT SIGNS FOR
 THAT GARAGE SALE THAT MORNING.
 AND INVESTIGATORS DON'T EVEN
 KNOW IF THE SHOOTER IS A MAN OR
 A WOMAN.
 DEFINITELY IT IS POSSIBLE
 THEY WERE TRYING TO DISGUISE
 THEIR APPEARANCE.
 Reporter: HER FAMILY MAKING A
 PLEA FOR THE PUBLIC TO HELP FIND
 THE KILLER.
 WE HAD TO TRADE OUR FIFTH
 ANNIVERSARY FOR HER FUNERAL.
 Reporter: AND DAVID, THIS
 GARAGE SALE IN THE DRIVEWAY HERE

 HUSBAND.
 AUTHORITIES SAY THEY HAVE
 GENERATED NEW LEADS OVERNIGHT,

 PRESIDENT TRUMP TONIGHT IS
 LASHING OUT, AS DEMOCRATS WHO

 PRESIDENCY INTO HIGH GEAR.
 I THINK OVERWHELMINGLY THE
 PUBLIC WANTS TO SEE THE
 PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS.
 Reporter: UNLIKE PREVIOUS
 PRESIDENTS, TRUMP HAS REFUSED TO
 RELEASE HIS RETURNS.
 I'M NOT RELEASING THE TAX
 RETURNS, BECAUSES YOU KNOW,
 THEY'RE UNDER AUDIT.
 Reporter: BUT NOW, DEMOCRATS
 HAVE THE POWER TO GO AFTER THEM.
 WE WILL ASK THE QUESTION,
 DOES THE PUBLIC HAVE A NEED TO
 KNOW THAT A PERSON SEEKING TO
 HOLD THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN OUR
 COUNTRY OBEYS THE TAX LAW?
 Reporter: WITH DEMOCRATS
 DIGGING IN, THE PRESIDENT IS
 LASHING OUT, TWEETING,
 "UNLIMITED PRESIDENTIAL
 HARASSMENT.
 THE DEMS AND THEIR COMMITTEES
 ARE GOING NUTS."
 IS THERE ANY CONCERN THAT YOU'RE
 IN DANGER OF APPEARING LIKE
 YOU'RE OVERREACHING?
 WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT SAYS
 ABOUT US, HE'S PROJECTING HIS
 OWN UNRULINESS.
 HE'S A PROJECTOR, AND THAT'S
 WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
 Reporter: THE HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IS
 LAUNCHING A SWEEPING
 INVESTIGATION INTO THE
 PRESIDENT, HIS FAMILY, HIS

 PLAYING POINTLESS POLITICAL
 GAMES.

                               d:
    When it comes to managing    your type 2 diabetes,
       what matters to you?
            Let's see.    Most of you say lower A1C.
      But only a few of you
  are thinking about your heart.
     Fact is, even though     it helps to manage A1C,
      type 2 diabetes still      increases your risk
        of a fatal heart        attack or stroke.
      JARDIANCE is the first      type 2 diabetes pill
        with a lifesaving      cardiovascular benefit
   for adults who have type 2   diabetes and heart disease,
    JARDIANCE significantly    reduces the risk of dying
   from a cardiovascular event
         and lowers A1C,     with diet and exercise.
    Let's give it another try.
      <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i>      <i> serious side effects</i>
     <i> including dehydration.</i>
      <i> This may cause you</i>      <i> to feel dizzy, faint,</i>
         <i> or lightheaded,</i>     <i> or weak upon standing.</i>
          <i> Ketoacidosis</i>    <i> is a serious side effect</i>
       <i> that may be fatal.</i>
    <i> Symptoms include nausea,</i>    <i> vomiting, stomach pain,</i>
           <i> tiredness,</i>     <i> and trouble breathing.</i>
   <i> A rare but life-threatening</i>       <i> bacterial infection</i>
   <i> in the skin of the genital</i>   <i> area could also occur.</i>
      <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> and call your doctor right away</i>
      <i> if you have symptoms</i>  <i> of this bacterial infection,</i>
          <i> ketoacidosis</i>    <i> or an allergic reaction.</i>
     <i> Symptoms of an allergic</i>     <i> reaction include rash,</i>
    <i> swelling, and difficulty</i>    <i> breathing or swallowing.</i>
     <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i>     <i> if you are on dialysis</i>
 <i> or have severe kidney problems.</i>
     <i> Other side effects are</i>     <i> sudden kidney problems,</i>
   <i> genital yeast infections,</i>   <i> increased bad cholesterol,</i>
  <i> and urinary tract infections,</i>      <i> which may be serious.</i>
    <i> Taking JARDIANCE with</i>    <i> a sulfonylurea or insulin</i>
   <i> may cause low blood sugar.</i>
   <i> Tell your doctor about</i>   <i> all the medicines you take</i>
       <i> and if you have any</i>       <i> medical conditions.</i>
  Isn't it time to rethink your  type 2 diabetes medication?
 Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE
       and get to the heart       of what matters.
 Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE
    98% of us don't get enough    omega-3s.
  Which is why MegaRed Advanced  4in1
  packs more omega-3 power into  one small softgel.
   It supports your heart...   Brain... Eyes... And joints.

 WE'RE GOING TO TURN NOW TO THAT APPARENT ROAD RAGE SHOOTING
 IN MINNEAPOLIS.
 A DRIVER SHOOTING A SCHOOL BUS
 DRIVER AND HITTING THE BUS
 DRIVER TWICE.
 HERE'S ABC'S CLAYTON SANDELL
 WITH THE NEW SURVEILLANCE.
 Reporter: WHAT POLICE SAY
 STARTED AS A FENDER BENDER
 BETWEEN A CAR AND A SCHOOL BUS,
 TONIGHT, A CASE OF ATTEMPTED
 MURDER.
 CAPTURED TUESDAY ON THIS
 MINNEAPOLIS TRAFFIC CAMERA,
 POLICE SAY THIS IS 31-YEAR-OLD
 KENNETH LILLY, STOPPED IN
 TRAFFIC, WALKING TOWARDS THE BUS
 AFTER IT APPARENTLY BUMPED HIS
 CAR.
 IT LOOKS LIKE THE GUY IS IN
 SOME SORT OF SECURITY UNIFORM OR
 SOMETHING.
 LOOKS LIKE HE IS -- DOES HAVE A
 WEAPON ON HIM.
 Reporter: WHEN THE BUS DRIVER
 REFUSES TO LET LILLY ONBOARD
 BECAUSE THERE'S AN 8-YEAR-OLD
 GIRL IN THE BACK, POLICE SAY
 LILLY PULLS A .9 MILLIMETER
 HANDGUN, AND YOU CAN SEE THE
 FLASHES, OPENS FIRE, STRIKING
 THE BUS DRIVER IN THE ARM AND
 GRAZING HIS HEAD.
 PULLED OVER ON THE LEFT
 SHOULDER, I'VE GOT HIM ON
 CAMERA.
 Reporter: POLICE SAY LILLY
 THEN CALLS 911.
 OFFICERS ARRIVING MOMENTS LATER
 AND TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY.
 INVESTIGATORS SAY LILLY TOLD
 THEM HE FEARED FOR HIS LIFE.
 BUT PROSECUTORS SAY THE VIDEO
 SHOWS HE WAS IN NO DANGER.
 WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A
 SELF DEFENSE CLAIM BASED UPON
 THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE RECEIVED SO
 FAR.
 Reporter: LILLY IS CHARGED
 WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER AND
 ASSAULT.
 THE BUS DRIVER, EXPECTED TO BE
 OKAY AND HIS 8-YEAR-OLD

 WHEN WE COME BACK, A WOMAN
 DISCOVERED IN A SUITCASE IN NEW

 A STORY WE'VE COVERED FOR YEARS.
 A MOTHER, A WIFE, HER FIRST
 HUSBAND, DEKD.
 HER SECOND HUSBAND, DEAD.
 THEN, HER DAUGHTER POISONS.
 NOW, NEW DETAILS, AND THE DAVID
 MUIR PRISON INTERVIEW THAT MADE

 STACY CASTER IS CONVICTED OF
 MURDERING HER HUSBAND, CONVICTED
 OF ATTEMPTED MURDER OF HER OWN
 DAUGHTER.
 AND SHE'S WALKING TOWARDS US AND
 WE WONDER, WHAT IS SHE GOING TO
 SAY THIS TIME?
 THE "20/20" EVENT, FRIDAY ON
 ABC.
        family and FARXIGA,
  the pill that starts with "f."
        FARXIGA, along with        diet and exercise,
     helps lower A1C in adults       with type 2 diabetes.
       It's one pill a day.
      And although it's not a         weight-loss drug,
   it may help you lose weight.
          Do not take if       allergic to FARXIGA.
    If you experience symptoms  of a serious allergic reaction
      such as rash, swelling,
       difficulty breathing          or swallowing,
       stop taking and seek     medical help right away.
    Do not take FARXIGA if you   have severe kidney problems,
        are on dialysis or       have bladder cancer.
      Tell your doctor right      away if you have blood
    or red color in your urine
    or pain while you urinate.
  FARXIGA can cause serious side  effects including dehydration,
     genital yeast infections        in women and men,
          serious urinary         tract infections,
         low blood sugar,       and kidney problems.
      Stop taking FARXIGA and    call your doctor right away
         if you have signs          of ketoacidosis
       which is serious and        may lead to death.
  Ask your doctor about the pill       that starts with "f"
       and visit FARXIGA.com           for savings.
        If you can't afford         your medication,
        AstraZeneca may be          able to help.
        If you can't afford         your medication,
           Hey, Darryl!                     Hey, Thomas.
 If you were choosing a network, would you want the one
 the experts at RootMetrics say
 is number one in the nation?
 Sure, they probably know what they're talking about.
             Or the one             that J.D. Power says
                  is highest in                  network quality
            by people            who use it every day?
 This is a tough one.                Well, not really,
        because Verizon won both.
                So you don't even                have to choose.
   Why didn't you just   lead with that?
 It's like a fun thing.
        Chosen by experts.          Chosen by you.
     Get 50 million songs now
    with Apple Music included,              on us.

              Woman:    This is your wake-up call.
   If you have moderate to   severe rheumatoid arthritis,
       month after month,       the clock is ticking
  on irreversible joint damage.
    Ongoing pain and stiffness
   are signs of joint erosion.
 HUMIRA can help stop the clock.
     Prescribed for 15 years,
    HUMIRA targets and blocks    a source of inflammation
         that contributes         to joint pain
     and irreversible damage.
   VO:<i> HUMIRA can lower your</i>  <i> ability to fight infections.</i>
      <i> Serious and sometimes</i>      <i> fatal infections</i>
     <i> including tuberculosis,</i>
     <i> and cancers, including</i>     <i> lymphoma, have happened,</i>
    <i> as have blood, liver, and</i>    <i> nervous system problems,</i>
   <i> serious allergic reactions,</i>
      <i> and new or worsening</i>         <i> heart failure.</i>
        <i> Tell your doctor</i>     <i> if you've been to areas</i>

       <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i>    <i> if you have an infection.</i>
              Woman:       Help stop the clock
     on further irreversible          joint damage.
   Talk to your rheumatologist.
      Right here. Right now.

 TO THE INDEX, AND TO THE MURDER MYSTERY IN CONNECTICUT.
 POLICE NOW IDENTIFYING THE
 VICTIM.
 VALERIE RACE WAS FOUND STUFFED
 IN A SUITCASE ON THE SIDE OF THE
 ROAD.
 SHE WAS REPORTED MISSING FROM
 NEW YORK A WEEK AGO WHEN SHE
 FAILED TO SHOW UP AT WORK.
 HER MOTHER SAYS HER DAUGHTER
 FEARED FOR HER OWN SAFETY BEFORE
 SHE VANISHED, AND POLICE ARE
 STILL SEARCHING FOR THE KILLER
 TONIGHT.
 AND THE IMAGE OVERSEAS THIS
 EVENING, THE AMAZING RESCUE IN
 TURKEY.
 A 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL PULLED ALIVE
 FROM THE RUBBLE.
 18 HOURS AFTER AN EIGHT-STORY
 BUILDING COLLAPSED IN ISTANBUL.
 AT LEAST TEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED.
 RESCUERS BELIEVE THERE MAY BE
 MORE SURVIVORS STILL.
 THE CAUSE IS STILL UNDER
 INVESTIGATION.
 WHEN WE COME BACK TONIGHT,
 CELEBRATING A BASEBALL LEGEND.
 A TRAIL BLAZER.
 AND WHAT WE UNEARTHED TODAY, IN
 A MOMENT.
    If you have postmenopausal    osteoporosis
   and a high risk for fracture
  now might not be the best time  to ask yourself
       are my bones strong?
  Life is full of make-or-break  moments.
   That's why it's so important
   to help reduce your risk of   fracture with Prolia®.
  Only Prolia® is proven to help  strengthen
 and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months.
 Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant,
   are allergic to it, or take   XGEVA®.
   Serious allergic reactions,
 like low blood pressure; trouble breathing;
 throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling;
   rash; itching; or hives have   happened.
  Tell your doctor about dental  problems
 as severe jaw bone problems may happen
  or new or unusual pain in your  hip groin, or thigh,
 as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred.
   Speak to your doctor before   stopping Prolia®
     as spine and other bone     fractures have occurred.
  Prolia® can cause serious side  effects,
 like low blood calcium, serious infections,
 which could need hospitalization, skin problems,
    and severe bone, joint, or    muscle pain.
          Are you ready?
 Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones.
     Gentle means everything,
    so we improved everything.
   We used 50% fewer ingredients
      Added one handed pumps
           And beat the       top safety standards
        The new JOHNSON'S®

      Building a better bank
        starts with looking         at something old,
       and saying, "really?"
    So Capital One is building     something completely new.

       Inviting places with     people here to help you,
           not sell you.
          And savings and      checking accounts with
       no fees or minimums.
          Because that's         how it should be.
       You can open one from      right here or anywhere
           in 5 minutes.
            Seriously,
           5 minutes...
    This is Banking Reimagined.
      What's in your wallet?
      Ok look, if you're not           the lead dog,
    the scenery never changes.
    That's why this is the view
     for every other full-size              pickup.
          And this year,    it's déjà vu all over again
   'Cuz only the Ford F-150 with        its high strength,
          military-grade        aluminum alloy body
  gives you best-in-class torque,
     best-in-class payload...
      and you got it, baby...
       best-in-class towing.
      Still leading the pack.
       This is the big dog!
      This is the Ford F-150.
          It doesn't just        raise the bar, pal.
          It is the bar.
     <i> Colon cancer screening</i>           <i> for people</i>
  <i> 50 and older at average risk.</i>
           I think it's time           for a new screen.
          For a different         kind of screen...
         for colon cancer.
         Thought about it?
          His wife asked      about screening options
          and her doctor           ordered me.
          I'm Cologuard,
          the noninvasive       test you use at home.
         No special drink.
           Just a trip         to the bathroom!
           <i> Cologuard.</i>
      Colon cancer screening      that's as easy as get,
             go, gone.
         Cologuard is not        right for everyone,
       so ask your doctor if        it's right for you.
 FINALLY TONIGHT, AMERICA STRONG.
 CELEBRATING LEGENDARY HALL OF
 FAMER FRANK ROBINSON, MAJOR
 LEAGUE BASEBALL'S FIRST
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MANAGER, AND
 ONE OF THE GAME'S GREATEST
 STARS.
 LINE DRIVE TO LEFT FIELD.
 WAY BACK -- IT IS GONE!
 PROBABLY ONE OF THE TOP FIVE
 TOUGHEST PLAYERS THAT I'VE EVER
 BEEN AROUND.
 THIS GUY WAS NOT ONLY A GREAT
 PLAYER, HE WAS A HARD PLAYER,
 BOY.
 HE WAS AS TOUGH AS NAILS.
 Reporter: FRANK ROBINSON WAS
 ONE OF BASEBALL'S MOST
 CELEBRATED AND MOST
 INTIMIDATING HITTERS.
 STARTING WITH THE REDS IN 1956,
 HE WAS ROOKIE OF THE YEAR.
 HE WAS THE BEST THAT I HAVE
 EVER SEEN AT KNOWING WHAT THE
 PITCHER WAS THROWING.
 FRANK COULD TAKE HIS HAT OFF,
 PUT IT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AND
 LOOK THROUGH ONE OF THOSE LITTLE
 HOLES IN HIS HAT AND I ASKED HIM
 ONE TIME, WHAT YOU ARE DOING?
 AND HE SAID, I'M WATCHING THE
 PITCHER.
 Reporter: THEN ROBINSON'S
 FIRST YEAR WITH THE ORIOLES,
 1966, WOULD HELP CEMENT HIS
 PLACE AS ONE OF THE GREATEST
 BASEBALL PLAYERS OF ALL TIME.
 HE WON BASEBALL'S TRIPLE CROWN,
 LEADING THE LEAGUE WITH
 49 HOMERS.
 EARNING THE AMERICAN LEAGUE MVP
 AWARD AND LEADING THE ORIOLES TO
 THEIR FIRST WORLD SERIES TITLE.
 ROBINSON, THE RIGHT-HAND
 BATTER.
 LONG DRIVE TO LEFT FIELD.
 WAY BACK, WAY BACK.
 KISS IT GOODBYE.
 HOMERUN.
 Reporter: HE WOULD LATER MAKE
 HISTORY AS A MANAGER.
 NO AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAD EVER
 MANAGED IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES.
 LEADING THE CLEVELAND INDIANS
 STARTING IN 1975.
 EVERYWHERE I WENT IT WAS,
 HOW'S IT FEEL TO BE THE FIRST
 BLACK MANAGER?
 I JUST WANTED TO BE LOOKED UP ON
 AND THOUGHT OF AS A MAJOR LEAGUE
 MANAGER.
 PEOPLE MADE SACRIFICES FOR ME,
 COMING ALONG, SO, I WANTED TO
 GIVE SOMETHING BACK AND THE DAY
 THAT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NOTHING
 TO GIVE, OR NOTHING TO OFFER
 BASEBALL, THAT'S WHEN I WILL
 THEN FADE OFF INTO THE SUNSET.
 A TRUE LEGEND.
 ROBINSON WAS 83.
 OUR THANKS TO ESPN AS WE LOOK
 BACK TODAY.
 I'M DAVID MUIR.
