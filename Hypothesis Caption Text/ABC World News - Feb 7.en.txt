Fact is, even though it helps to manage A1C, type 2 diabetes still increases your risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke. JARDIANCE is the first type 2 diabetes pill with a lifesaving cardiovascular benefit for adults who have type 2 diabetes and heart disease, JARDIANCE significantly reduces the risk of dying from a cardiovascular event and lowers A1C, with diet and exercise. Let's give it another try. <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i> <i> serious side effects</i> <i> including dehydration.</i> <i> This may cause you</i> <i> to feel dizzy, faint,</i> <i> or lightheaded,</i> <i> or weak upon standing.</i> <i> Ketoacidosis</i> <i> is a serious side effect</i> <i> that may be fatal.</i> <i> Symptoms include nausea,</i> <i> vomiting, stomach pain,</i> <i> tiredness,</i> <i> and trouble breathing.</i> <i> A rare but life-threatening</i> <i> bacterial infection</i> <i> in the skin of the genital</i> <i> area could also occur.</i> <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> and call your doctor right away</i> <i> if you have symptoms</i> <i> of this bacterial infection,</i> <i> ketoacidosis</i> <i> or an allergic reaction.</i> <i> Symptoms of an allergic</i> <i> reaction include rash,</i> <i> swelling, and difficulty</i> <i> breathing or swallowing.</i> <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i> <i> if you are on dialysis</i> <i> or have severe kidney problems.</i> <i> Other side effects are</i> <i> sudden kidney problems,</i> <i> genital yeast infections,</i> <i> increased bad cholesterol,</i> <i> and urinary tract infections,</i> <i> which may be serious.</i> <i> Taking JARDIANCE with</i> <i> a sulfonylurea or insulin</i> <i> may cause low blood sugar.</i> <i> Tell your doctor about</i> <i> all the medicines you take</i> <i> and if you have any</i> <i> medical conditions.</i> Isn't it time to rethink your type 2 diabetes medication? Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE and get to the heart of what matters. Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE 98% of us don't get enough omega-3s. Which is why MegaRed Advanced 4in1 packs more omega-3 power into one small softgel. It supports your heart... Brain... Eyes... And joints. MegaRed.

That's why it's so important to help reduce your risk of fracture with Prolia®. Only Prolia® is proven to help strengthen and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months. Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant, are allergic to it, or take XGEVA®. Serious allergic reactions, like low blood pressure; trouble breathing; throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling; rash; itching; or hives have happened. Tell your doctor about dental problems as severe jaw bone problems may happen or new or unusual pain in your hip groin, or thigh, as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred. Speak to your doctor before stopping Prolia® as spine and other bone fractures have occurred. Prolia® can cause serious side effects, like low blood calcium, serious infections, which could need hospitalization, skin problems, and severe bone, joint, or muscle pain. Are you ready? Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones. Gentle means everything, so we improved everything.
