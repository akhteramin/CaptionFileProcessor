 ARE YOU READY? WE ARE HOURS AWAY FROM SNOW AND
 ICE.
 OUR MID UROLOGIST ARE WATCHING
 YOU WALKING YOU THROUGH, HOUR
 BY HOUR.
 AND HIS BACK, BERNIE
 SANDERS IS OFFICIALLY RUNNING
 FOR PRESIDENT, AGAIN.
 PLUS, SPEAKING OUT, ONE OF
 THE WOMEN ACCUSING JUSTIN FOR
 EFFECTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT
 SAID SHE'S WILLING TO TESTIFY.
 AND WE'VE LEARNED OF SECRET
 GUIDELINES #
 SLOP OF SNOW AND ICE WILL
 LEAVE MUCH OF THE METRO
 TEMPORARILY PARALYZED.
 LET'S GET TO WHAT YOU NEED TO
 KNOW ABOUT THE APPROACHING AND
 IMPENDING STORM.
 WE COULD SEE UP TO SIX INCHES
 IN THE METRO.
 POWER OUTAGES ARE POSSIBLE AS
 WELL.
 THE IMPACT WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL
 TO THE ROADS AS WELL AS ON AIR.
 OUR TEAM IS ON TOP OF THIS
 STORM, MICHAEL HAS A LOOK AT
 SNOW PREPARATIONS NDC AND ALSO
 TELL US HOW OFFICIALS IN
 MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA ARE
 GETTING READY FOR THE STORM AS
 WELL.
 WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR AND IN
 YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, LET'S GET
 THIS UPDATED FORECAST RIGHT NOW.
 MELISSA, WE'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS
 UPDATES ALREADY IN THE
 NEWSROOM?
 I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
 WITH BOTH METEOROLOGISTS, WE
 THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT
 MORE SLEEP THAT'S HAPPENING
 TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
 WE HAVE UPDATED THE SNOW TOTALS.
 HERE'S THE LATEST AS OF RIGHT
 NOW, WE WILL START OFF WITH THE
 HIGHEST TOTAL, THESE WILL
 INCLUDE LOUDOUN COUNTY, UPPER
 MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND POINTS
 NORTH AND WEST OF THAT AND SET
 OF 6-8 INCHES, WE ARE GOING 4-6
 INCHES BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S
 MORE SLEEP THAT'S GOING TO BE
 HAPPENING TOMORROW AFTERNOON
 WHICH WOULD MEAN A LITTLE LESS
 SNOW.
 LET'S GO INTO THE D.C. AREA,
 THE BELTWAY, PRINCE GEORGES
 COUNTY, THE NORTHERN HALF OF
 THIS, TO-FOUR INCHES OF SNOW
 AND SLEET COMBINED, THEN WE
 HAVE FAR SOUTHERN MARYLAND,
 THAT IS AN ADJUSTMENT FROM WHAT
 WE SHOWED YOU YESTERDAY EVENING
 ON THE NEWS AT 5 PM.
 AND, WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING
 OVER MORE INFORMATION THIS
 AFTERNOON.
 WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SET OF MODELS
 COMING IN, THERE WILL LIKELY BE
 ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT
 BUT THE IMPACTS ARE LOCKED IN
 AT THIS POINT.
 WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE
 SNOW TOMORROW MORNING, IT'S
 GOING TO TRANSITION OVER TO
 SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN, AND
 THAT IS GOING TO CAUSE MORE
 IMPACTS FOR TRAVEL, AND THE
 FREEZING RAIN WILL BE MORE
 SIGNIFICANT ALONG I 81, WHERE
 DO YOU THINK WE CAN SEE POWER
 OUTAGES.
 FOR THE METRO, THE PRIMARY
 IMPACT IS GOING TO BE TRAVEL,
 WHEN IT BECOMES DIFFICULT,
 IT'LL BECOME DANGEROUS AS THE
 MORNING UNFOLDS. HERE'S THE
 TIMING ON FUTURECAST, WE WILL
 START OFF ON MIDNIGHT TONIGHT,
 ENJOY THAT LITTLE BIT OF
 SUNSHINE OUT THERE, CLOUDS ARE
 BUILDING BY MIDNIGHT, WE ARE
 STILL DRY BUT THE SNOW IS
 ARRIVING TOMORROW MORNING,
 ARRIVING IN BC SOMETIME BETWEEN
 FIVE-6 AM, WE WILL SEE THAT
 SNOW LINE SHIFTING NORTHEAST,
 AND AFTER 7 AM, THE SNOW RATE
 WILL START TO PICK UP, EVEN IF
 YOU ARE TRYING TO DRIVE INTO
 WORK TOMORROW MORNING AND IT'S
 FAIRLY SNOWING, IT GETS WORSE
 AS IT GOES THROUGHOUT THE
 MORNING.
 LET'S GO TO NOON, SOUTHWEST
 SIDE OF THE METRO, IT WILL
 TRANSITION FROM SNOW INTO SLEET
 AND FREEZING RAIN, WE'VE GOT
 THE TRANSITION NDC HAPPENING AT
 2 PM, NOW WE'VE GOT THIS HUGE
 AREA IN PINK OF SNOW, SLEET AND
 PHRASING RAIN FREEZING RAIN,
 GUYS, WE'VE GOT FREEZING RAIN
 AND SLEET. FOR D.C., HERE'S
 YOUR TIMING, 6 AM, SNOW, ONCE
 WE GET TO NOON WE'VE GOT THIS
 MAKES STARTING TO HAPPEN, AND
 IT'S NOT UNTIL THE VERY END OF
 THE DAY, 5 PM ONWARD, DO YOU
 SEE TRANSITIONS INTO RAIN, I'LL
 TALK MORE ABOUT IMPACT, ZONE BY
 ZONE, COMING UP IN JUST A FEW
 MINUTES.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 ANY TIME THERE'S A THREAT OF
 SEVERE WINTER WEATHER IN THE
 DISTRICT, THE DEPARTMENT OF
 WORKS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF
 TRANSPORTATION JOIN FORCES TO
 CREATE WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE SNOW
 TEAM.
 MICHAEL HAS MORE.
 D.C. SNOW TEAM USES THE
 NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TO
 MONITOR WEATHER REPORTS.
 ONCE A WEATHER THREAT IS
 FORECASTED THE SNOW TEAM
 DECIDES ON AN ACTION PLAN BUT
 IT'S NEVER ONE SIZE FITS ALL.
 WE HAVE TO TAKE THE VERACITY
 OF THE REPORTING THAT'S COMING
 IN, HOW CONFIDENT THE WEATHER
 FOLKS ARE ON THEIR FORECAST,
 THEN WE HAVE TO ADD IN THE
 FACTOR IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
 WE ARE AHEAD OF THINGS.
 THE NUMBER OF WORKERS,
 EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES DEPENDS
 ON THE PREDICTION OF THE STORM.
 WE GET UP THERE, WHEN WE HAVE
 BIG STORMS, OR IF WE GET INTO A
 BIG ICE SITUATION.
 IT'S A LARGE OPERATION.
 WHEN THE THREAT IS MOST
 SEVERE, THE SNOW TEAM WILL
 DEPLOY MORE THAN 800 PEOPLE AND
 MORE THAN 500 PLOWS, ALL
 WORKING 12 HOUR SHIFTS UNTIL
 THE STORM IS OVER.THE ADDED
 ICE WE ARE EXPECTED TOMORROW
 WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS AS WELL, A
 COATING OF ICE CAN INCREASE THE
 WEIGHT OF TREE BRANCHES AND
 POWERLINES, PREPARED TO KEEP
 THE CHILDREN AWAY FROM TREES
 FROM THE STORM.
 FAMILIES MAY ALSO WANT TO
 PREPARE FOR THE POSSIBLE LOSS
 OF POWER.
 PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE
 DIRECTIONS FROM THE
 MANUFACTURER.
 OUR WEATHER TEAM IS UPDATING
 THE FORECAST EVERY HOUR AND ARE
 REPORTERS ARE GATHERING MORE
 INFORMATION ABOUT DELAYS AND
 CLOSURES.
 STAY CONNECTED WITH US.
 THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
 ARRESTED AND CHARGED IN THE
 MURDER OF A 27-YEAR-OLD GIRL
 AND FATHER.
 CHRISTOPHER TURNER WENT MISSING
 ON JANUARY 20, HIS CAR WAS
 DISCOVERED DAYS LATER IN
 HAGERSTOWN.
 HIS BODY WAS FOUND LAST MONTH
 IN WEST VIRGINIA.
 TODAY WE LEARNED THREE PEOPLE
 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, FOR HIS
 MURDER, THEY ARE FACING MURDER,
 ASSAULT AND ROBBERY CHARGES.
 HE HAD TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AND A
 THIRD ON THE WAY.
 MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA HAVE
 JOINED IN THE FIGHT TO STOP A
 SOUTHERN BORDER WALL FROM BEING
 BUILT.
 LAST NIGHT, BOTH STATES JOINS
 THE 16 STATE LAWSUIT AGAINST
 THE TRAP ADMINISTRATION FUNDING
 FOR THE BORDER WALL.
 BOTH STATES, MARYLAND AND
 VIRGINIA, STAND TO LOSE
 SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING
 FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION
 PROJECTS, IF THE NATIONAL
 EMERGENCY DECLARATION HOLD UP
 IN COURT.
 THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY
 DECLARATION GIVES THE PRESIDENT
 POWERS TO MOVE FUNDS AROUND
 WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL.
 IN THIS CASE, THAT'S TO PAY FOR
 THE BORDER WALL PROJECT.
 $6 BILLION WILL COME FROM THE
 MILITARY BUDGET, SO IN
 VIRGINIA, THAT'S RIGHT $131
 MILLION IN MILITARY
 CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.
 MONEY MEANT FOR SIX BASES IN
 VIRGINIA INCLUDING THE
 PENTAGON.
 THE STATE OF MARYLAND CAN LOSE
 AS MUCH AS $513 MILLION IN
 PROJECTS.
 FUNDING FOR PROJECTS SUPPORTS
 MEET AND JOINT BASE ANSWERS,
 THAT'S WHAT MONDAY NIGHT, BOTH
 STATES SIGNED ON TO BE PART OF
 THE 16 STATE LAWSUIT AGAINST
 PRESIDENT TRUMP NATIONAL
 EMERGENCY.
 BOTH MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA
 AS ATTORNEY GENERALS SAID THE
 SITUATION AT THE BORDER DOES NOT
 CONSTITUTE A NATIONAL
 EMERGENCY.
 THAT'S GOING TO BE AT THE HEART
 OF THE LAWSUIT, WHETHER OR NOT
 WHAT THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES IS
 HAPPENING AT THE BORDER IS A
 NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND WHETHER
 OR NOT THERE IS INFORMATION TO
 SUPPORT THE REASONING.
 ONE MAN IS DEAD, THREE
 OTHERS HURT AFTER A THREE CAR
 ACCIDENT IN PRINCE GEORGE
 COUNTY, IT HAPPENED AROUND 10
 PM LAST NIGHT ON INDIAN HEAD
 HIGHWAY. POLICE SAY IT INVOLVES
 TWO SUVS AND A THIRD CAR.
 POLICE ARE STILL INVESTIGATING
 EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED THE
 ACCIDENT.
 ONE WOMAN ACCUSING JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SAID
 SHE WANTS TO TESTIFY IN PUBLIC.
 MEREDITH WATSON BLASTED THE
 GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO FOR THEIR
 FAILURE TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS
 IN AN OP-ED PUBLISHED IN THE
 WASHINGTON POST.
 SHE CLAIMS FAIRFAX ASSAULTED
 HER WHEN THE TWO WERE COLLEGE
 STUDENTS.
 BERNIE STANDARDS SANDERS
 OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED HIS
 CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENCY.
 I AM GOING TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 THAT'S CORRECT.
 WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
 THIS TIME?
 WE ARE GOING TO WIN.
 WE ARE GOING TO ALSO LAUNCH
 WHAT I THINK IS UNPRECEDENTED
 IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY,
 THAT IS A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT,
 JOHN, TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR
 TRANSFORMING THE ECONOMIC AND
 POLITICAL LIFE OF THE COUNTRY.
 THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT.
 THE 77-YEAR-OLD DEMOCRATIC
 SOCIALIST CHALLENGED HILLARY
 CLINTON IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 RESIDENTIAL PRIMARY IN 2016,
 SANDERS HAS RESHIPPED HIM
 ACCREDIT POLITICS AND EARN A
 LOYAL FOLLOWING WITH HIS WITH
 HIS PASSIONATE DEFIANCE.
 LARRY HOGAN SAT DOWN WITH
 BRUCE TO TALK ABOUT A POSSIBLE
 RUN IN 2020, HOGAN HAS HIGH
 APPROVAL RATINGS AS REPUBLICAN
 GOVERNOR IN A VERY BLUE STATE
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE IS A
 LOT OF SUPPORT RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT.CAN I CALL YOU A
 MODERATE REPUBLICAN?
 YOU COULDN'T SURVIVE THE
 PRIMARY.
 SO YEAH, LOOK, I'M NOT
 THINKING ABOUT THAT.
 OUR SYSTEM IS SUCH THAT THE
 MOST LIBERAL DEMOCRATS USUALLY
 WINS THE DEMOCRATIC MANY, THE
 MOST CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN
 WINS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
 A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT 55% OF
 MARYLAND RESIDENTS DON'T WANT
 THE GOVERNOR TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 85% OF THOSE INTERVIEWED SAID
 THE GOVERNOR IS LIKABLE, 80%
 APPLY WHAT HE'S DOING WITH THE
 STATE GOVERNMENT.
 SOME REPUBLICANS FEEL HE WOULD
 MAKE A GOOD CHALLENGER TO
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 STILL TO COME, A NEW REPORT
 REVEALS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS
 SECRET GUIDELINES FOR WHAT TO
 DO WHEN PRIE

 A SHOCKING REPORT FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS THE CATHOLIC
 CHURCH HAS BEEN AWARE OF PRIESTS
 FATHERING CHILDREN FOR DECADES.
 IT ALSO REVERED REVEALED THEIR
 SECRET RULES ON HOW TO HANDLE
 THE SITUATION.
 THE VATICAN REVEALED IT HAS
 SECRET GUIDELINES FOR PRIESTS
 WHO FATHER CHILDREN DESPITE
 THEIR VOWS OF CELIBACY.
 THIS IS ALL ACCORDING TO A
 REPORT BY THE NEW YORK TIMES.
 IT COMES AT A TIME WHERE THE
 CATHOLIC CHURCH IS DEALING WITH
 A SLEW OF SCANDALS INVOLVING
 SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN.
 THE REPORT TELLS A STORY OF ONE
 MAN, WHOSE FATHER WAS A
 CATHOLIC PRIEST.
 WHEN ASKED BY THE NEWSPAPER IF
 THESE SECRET RULES EXIST, THE
 VATICAN CONFIRMED IT.
 UNDER THOSE RULES, A PRIEST WHO
 FATHERS A CHILD IS REQUESTED TO
 LEAVE THE CHURCH AND DEVOTE
 HIMSELF TO THAT CHILD HOWEVER,
 A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE CHURCH
 SAYS IT'S REALLY MORE A
 FORMALITY THAN AN ORDER.
 NOW PRIEST, THEY ARE REQUIRED
 TO MAINTAIN A LIFE OF CELIBACY,
 WE SEE WITH THE GROWING NUMBER
 OF SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDALS, THAT
 THESE VALVES ARE OFTEN BROKEN.
 IT WAS JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO
 THAT POPE FRANCIS KNOWLEDGE FOR
 THE FIRST TIME, THAT THERE'S
 ALSO BEEN SEXUAL ABUSE OF NUNS
 BY PRIESTS AND BISHOPS INSIDE
 THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
 THIS COMES AS CATHOLIC BISHOPS
 FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WILL
 MEET THIS WEEK FOR A SUMMIT ON
 THE ISSUE OF CLERICAL SEXUAL
 ABUSE.
 DURING THAT RETREAT, CHILDREN
 OF PRIESTS WILL ALSO BE THERE,
 MEET WITH MEMBERS OF THE
 CATHOLIC CHURCH.
 THE VATICAN SAYS THE
 GUIDELINES WERE DESIGNED TO
 PROTECT THE CHILD, RECENTLY THE
 CATHOLIC CHURCH IMPOSED A TIES
 PUNISHMENT BY DEFROCKING FOR
 THE FORMER CARDINAL PETER
 McCARRICK, HE'S THE MOST SENIOR
 FIGURE TO BE DEFROCKED IN
 MODERN TIMES.
 A WELL-KNOWN DESIGNER, CARL
 LAGERFELD PASSED AWAY TODAY, HE
 WAS KNOWN FOR HIS ICONIC DESIGN
 AS WELL AS HIS WHITE PONYTAIL
 AND DARK GLASSES.
 WORKING FOR DESIGNERS LIKE
 SANDY AND CHANELLE, HIS AGE HAS
 BEEN A MYSTERY FOR DECADES,
 THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE HAD
 TWO BIRTH CERTIFICATES, ONE
 DATED 1933, AND ANOTHER, 1938,
 HE WAS AROUND 85 YEARS OLD.
 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES IS BEING
 INVESTIGATED BY THE FAA OVER
 BAGGAGE WEIGHT DISCREPANCIES.
 AIR SAFETY REGULATORS ARE
 INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE
 CARRIER HAD WIDESPREAD
 MISCALCULATIONS OF COMBINED
 WEIGHT FOR CHECKED BAGS, LOADED
 ONTO PLANES, SPARKING SAFETY
 CONCERNS.
 THE COMPANY SAID IT WILL BEGIN
 A NEW BAGGAGE COUNTING
 PROCEDURE BY THE END OF THE
 YEAR.
 THE NEWS COMES AFTER A
 WEEKEND WHERE SOUTHWEST SAW
 MORE CANCELLATIONS AND DELAYS
 THAN ANY OTHER USAir LINE,
 ABOUT 100 FLIGHTS WERE CANCELED
 OVER PRESIDENTS' DAY WEEKEND.
 MORE THAN 40 PLANES HAD TO BE
 TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE, THAT'S
 MORE THAN DOUBLE THEIR USUAL
 AVERAGE.
 IT WAS ALL OVER MAINTENANCE
 ISSUES AND AN INTERNAL MAN ML,
 MANAGERS CALLED IT IN
 OPERATIONAL STATE OF EMERGENCY.
 WE CAN TALK ABOUT
 EMERGENCIES AS WE GET READY TO
 FACE THIS STORM.
 YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CHANGING
 FORECAST, AND I DON'T THINK WE
 CAN BRUSH AWAY THE FACT THAT
 ICE AND SLEET IS STILL
 DANGEROUS?
 NO, IN FACT IT'S MORE
 DANGEROUS THAN DRIVING ON THE
 SNOW.
 IN SNOW, YOU CAN GET A LITTLE
 BIT OF TRACTION, WITH ICE, YOU
 CAN'T.
 WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE FACETS OF
 THIS STORM IT'S GOING TO BE A
 SLOPPY MESS.
 NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SLEET
 AND SNOW FALL POTENTIAL,
 THROUGH ABOUT 4 PM TOMORROW,
 OUR BULL'S-EYES ? THE NORTHWEST
 OF BC, 4-6 INCHES, LOCALLY IT
 COULD BE HIGHER IN SOME OF THE
 HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
 2-4 INCHES FOR D.C. I THINK
 YOUR CHANGEOVER IS GOING TO
 HAPPEN EARLIER, SO YOU DON'T
 END UP WITH AS MUCH.
 LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING,
 WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING ALL
 SNOW?
 IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH WHAT THE
 TEMPERATURES IN THE ATMOSPHERE
 LOOK AT.
 I'VE PULLED UP HERE, A DIAGRAM,
 IF IT'S ALL COLD FROM THE
 CLOUDS TO WHERE IT SNOWS ON THE
 GROUND, IT IS SNOW, BUT
 SOMETIMES THESE SITUATIONS LIKE
 WHAT WE ARE GETTING, WE HAVE A
 LITTLE NOSE OF WARM AIR MIXING
 AND, THAT WE GET FREEZING RAIN
 AND SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN IS
 THE MOST DIFFICULT FOR DRIVING,
 THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.
 IT'S FALLING AS LIQUID, AND
 THEN IT FREEZES ON CONTACT,
 THAT'S WHERE IT MAKES BRIDGES
 AND OVERPASSES VERY DIFFICULT
 FOR TRAVELING ON, AND THAT'S
 WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT FOR
 TOMORROW, AND SOME OF OUR 81
 COMMUNITIES.
 THIS IS ICE POTENTIAL, THIS IS
 SHOWING WE COULD BE DEALING
 WITH A QUARTER INCH OF ICE.
 WE COULD BE LOOKING AT POWER
 OUTAGES OUT IN THAT DIRECTION,
 I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH
 FOR POWER OUTAGES INSIDE THE
 METRO AREA BUT A GLAZING OF
 ICE, IT'LL MAKE ENOUGH TO CAUSE
 REALLY DIFFICULT TRAVEL AND
 SLICK CONDITIONS.
 SO, THE IMPACT TOMORROW,
 MORNING COMMUTE, AFTERNOON
 COMMUTE, YEAH, YOUR IMPACT IS
 THAT TRAVEL BECOMES DIFFICULT.
 WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH COLD
 OUT TOMORROW.
 IT STARTS TOMORROW BEFORE 5 AM
 TOUR SOUTHWESTERN COUNTIES,
 D.C. METRO, IN BLUE, 5-7 HIM IS
 WHEN THE SNOW IS WRITING, AFTER
 6 AM FOR BALTIMORE AND THE
 EAST.
 HERE COMES THE BEGINNING EDGE
 OF THE SNOW ARRIVING AT THAT
 MORNING COMMUTE. YOU ARE
 HEADING INTO WORK, IT STARTS TO
 SNOW, QUICKLY THE ROADS ARE
 BECOMING SLICK AND SNOW-COVERED
 IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TREATED,
 AND 10 AM, THE SNOW IS PICKING
 UP IN INTENSITY.
 SO TOMORROW MORNING, THAT SNOW
 IS NOT JUST LIGHT, IT IS
 BECOMING LOCALLY MODERATE TO
 HEAVY AT TIMES.
 12 PM, THERE IS STILL SNOW IN
 D.C. BUT WE ARE MIXING WITH
 SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN, AND
 D.C. TRANSITIONS TO THAT WINTRY
 MIX AS WE GET CLOSER TO 2 PM TO
 4 PM.
 FINALLY, BY THE EVENING
 COMMUTE, D.C. IS ABOVE
 FREEZING, WE WILL BE DEALING
 WITH RAIN, BUT IT'S GOING TO
 TAKE UNTIL 7 PM, IF NOT LATER,
 FOR SOME OF THOSE NORTHERN
 COUNTIES TO FINALLY TRANSITION
 OUT OF THE FREEZING RAIN, TO
 RAIN, JUST RECAPPING, SNOW FOR
 THE MORNING COMMUTE, ROADS ARE
 SLICK, LUNCH TIME, SNOW TO THE
 NORTH, MIXED TO THE SOUTH,
 ROADS ARE STILL SLICK AND ROADS
 ARE SLICK NORTH OF TOWN WITH A
 MIXED CONTINUING, THEN SOUTH OF
 TOWN, WE ARE TRANSITIONING TO
 RAIN. SEVEN DAY FORECAST, WE
 GET PAST TOMORROW AND YEAH, WE
 DO TURN WILDER FOR MILDER FOR
 YOUR THURSDAY MORNING.
 LARRY?

     Patients that I see that     complain about dry mouth,
     they feel like they have     to drink a lot of water.
    Medications seem to be the  number one cause for dry mouth.
        Dry mouth can cause        increased cavities,
   bad breath, oral irritation.
   I like to recommend Biotene.
     Biotene has a full array   of products that replenishes
    the moisture in your mouth.
     Biotene definitely works.
         It makes patients         so much happier.
      I'm a concrete mason.
  I had severe fatigue, went to            a doctor.
      Became diagnosed with       Hodgkin's lymphoma.
     I had to put my trust in            somebody.
   We recommended chemotherapy, and then a stem cell transplant.
  When his disease progressed,
   I thought that he would be a          good candidate
        for immunotherapy
   to unleash his immune system       against the cancer.
    I'm back to working hard.

 DARREN HAYNES HAS LOOK AT THE
 POSSIBILITY THAT HARPER COULD
