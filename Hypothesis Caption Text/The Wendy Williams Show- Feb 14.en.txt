 ALSO, "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK."
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU.
 MY COSTAR FROM
 "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK,"
 TAYLOR SCHILLING, IS HERE TODAY.
 SHE WILL BE MY GUEST, WHICH IS
 AWESOME.
 I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY A
 SPECIAL THANK YOU TO WENDY FOR
 HAVING ME.
 [APPLAUSE]
 AND TRUSTING ME.
 I HOPE YOU DON'T REGRET THIS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I CANNOT MAKE ANY PROMISES.
 [LAUGHS]
 OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED!
 IT'S TIME FOR --
 Audience: "HOT TOPICS"!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 Jason: WOW.
 [LAUGHS]
 YOU GUYS KNOW IT'S 10:00 A.M.,
 RIGHT?
 [LAUGHS]
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 BEFORE WE START WITH
 "HOT TOPICS," CAN I GET THIS YOU
 CAN PLEASE?
 [HARP MUSIC]
 I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT -I
 DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING
 YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF, BUT I
 WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT
 THESE ARE THE SAME SHOES I HAVE
 WORN EVERY TIME THAT I'VE BEEN
 ON THIS SHOW.
 AND I NOTICED THAT LAST TIME --
 SO I DID THE SHOE CAM, WITH
 WENDY THE FIRST TIME I WAS HERE.
 AND I CAME BACK WITH MY WIFE,
 JENNY, DURING THE INTERVIEW I
 SAID, "OH, MY GOSH, I HAVE WHEN
 THE SHOES ON THIS SHOW BEFORE."
 I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE MY LUCKY
 WENDY SHOES.
 AND OF COURSE THE PURPLE WENDY
 SOCKS.
 THE BIG NEWS OVERNIGHT IS THE
 FIGHT BETWEEN OFFSET AND CHRIS
 BROWN OVER 21 SAVAGE POSSIBLY
 GETTING DEPORTED.
 THERE'S LOTS OF MEMES GOING
 AROUND, MOCKING 21.
 WHICH OFFENDED HIS FANS,
 INCLUDING HIS FRIEND OFFSET.
 CHRIS BROWN POSTED WANT OF THE
 MEMES AND OFFSET RESPONDED,
 SAYING, "MEMES AIN'T FUNNY.
 LAME."
 THERE YOU GO.
 [LAUGHTER]
 JUST GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES.
 I WILL SETTLE IN.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 I'LL GET THERE.
 WELL, CHRIS BROWN CLAPPED BACK.
 HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.
 I NEED A CARD FOR THIS.
 HE SAID, "EFF YOU, LITTLE BOY.
 BETTER WORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU GOT
 GOING AND FOCUS ON YOU.
 IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR -FACE
 [BLEEP] OUT MY COMMENTS.
 CALL ME PERSONALLY.
 YOU WANT SOME CLOUT WITH ALL
 YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS PULL UP.
 NO CAMERA, NO FLEXING, AND ALL
 THAT!
 IF YOU ARE REAL MEN, FIGHT ME.
 AND ANOTHER THING, SUCK MY
 BLANK."
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 WOW.
 WOW!
 WOW.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK BLANK IS?
 [LAUGHTER]
 OFFSET CLAPPED BACK WITH "COKE
 HEAD DON'T WANT SMOKE."
 I'M SORRY -WHAT DOES THAT --
 I'VE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.
 NORMAN, DO YOU KNOW?
 Norman: OFFSET IS ACCUSING
 CHRIS OF ABUSING COCAINE.
 HE IS BASICALLY SAYING CHRIS
 SHOULDN'T WANT ANY BEEF OR
 PROBLEMS.
 ACCORDING TO URBAN DICTIONARY.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Jason: WELL, CHRIS
 CHALLENGED OFFSET TO A FIGHT.
 YEAH.
 WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD WIN THAT
 FIGHT?
 [AUDIENCE SHOUTING]
 Jason: HOLD ON, CLAP YOUR
 HANDS IF YOU THINK CHRIS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 CLAP YOUR HANDS IF YOU THINK
 OFFSET.
 [LESS APPLAUSE]
 OKAY, I GOT IT.
 CHRIS.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 WELL, I WILL SAY THIS.
 THEY WOULD BOTH KICK MY -I
 WOULD NOT GO NEAR METHANOL.
 SPEAKING OF OFFSET, HIS WIFE --
 CARDI B -SHE WENT ON SOCIAL
 MEDIA TO TELL FANS HOW MUCH
 MONEY IT TAKES TO BE CARDI B.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 BEING AN ARTIST, LOOKING GOOD
 FOR YOU, DOING ALL THIS LEAP TO
 PLEASE YOU, THAT COSTS MONEY.
 ME, FOR EXAMPLE, MY BILLS IS
 LIKE $300,000, $250,000, EVERY
 SINGLE MONTH.
 I TRY TO DO IT CHEAPER, AND IT'S
 NOT.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Jason: OKAY, I LOVE
 CARDI B.
 I LOVE HOW HONEST SHE IS.
 SHE IS SO REAL.
 I DO.
 I LOVE HER.
 BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET MUCH
 SYMPATHY FROM ME WHEN OR LIKE,
 "LOOK, I HAVE TRIED TO GET IT
 LOWER THAN $300,000 A MONTH, BUT
 I JUST CAN'T, OKAY?
 FORGIVE ME."
 NOT QUITE RELATABLE.
 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO SHELL
 OUT EACH MONTH.
 MONTHLY.
 MY WIFE AND I DO NOT SPEND
 NEARLY THAT MUCH.
 JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE
 INSIGHT, HERE IS OUR MONTHLY
 EXPENSES.
 A FEW, IF I MAY. BUDGET.
 RENT AND UTILITIES, $10,000.
 FACIALS AND MASSAGES, $2100.
 WARDROBE, INCLUDING WHAT ISSUES,

 I DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD GIVE IT
 REFERENCE!
 HAIR EXTENSIONS, $1500.
 BIKINI WAX, $350.
 MEDICARE AND PEDICURE, $600.
 AND $3500 AND BOTOX TREATMENTS.
 NOW, MY WIFE'S MONTHLY
 EXPENSES...
 [LAUGHTER]
 BY THE WAY, I LOVE A GOOD MANY
 PATTY
 FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT ON THAT CAKE, GET INVOLVED.
 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO TREAT
 YOURSELF.
 IT REALLY IS.
 IT'S RELAXING, PERSONAL HYGIENE
 IS KEY.
 TRUST ME, EVERYONE WINS IN THIS
 EQUATION.
 CAN WE TALK ABOUT
 "THE BACHELOR?"
 I USUALLY WATCH "THE BACHELOR."
 IN YEARS PAST I HAVE EVEN LIKE
 TO EAT IT.
 MY WIFE AND I, JENNY, WE GET
 VERY INVOLVED EMOTIONALLY.
 I HAVEN'T REALLY WATCHED THIS
 SEASON.
 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK MY KIDS
 FOR THAT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 APPARENTLY THIS YEAR IS PRETTY
 JUICY.
 THE BACHELOR IS A 26-YEAR-OLD
 VIRGIN.
 ONE OF THE WOMEN ON THE SHOW IS
 A VERY PRETTY 21-YEAR-OLD NAMED
 HEATHER WHO HAD NEVER BEEN
 KISSED.
 Audience: WHAT?
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Jason: DO WE BELIEVE THIS?
 Audience: NO!
 Jason: THANK YOU!
 I WAS LIKE, "REALLY, YOU GUYS?"
 AND MAKES FOR INCREDIBLE
 TELEVISION, OBVIOUSLY.
 I'M SURE THERE IS A WORLD WHERE
 SHE HASN'T.
 BUT FIRST OF ALL, SHE IS
 GORGEOUS.
 ANYONE SHE WANTED, SHE COULD
 HAVE HAD HER PICK.
 I DON'T KNOW THAT I ENTIRELY BUY
 IT, BUT LET'S GO WITH IT FOR A
 MOMENT.
 ASSUMING THAT'S THE CASE, MONDAY
 NIGHT WAS THE BIG MOMENT.
 HE TOOK HER OUT ON A DATE AND
 HERE IS HAPPENED.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 IT'S AMAZING.
 [LAUGHS]
 I HAVE KISSED A BOY!
 [LAUGHS]
 IT WAS SO GOOD!
 IT LITERALLY JUST FELT SO
 NATURAL!
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Jason: [LAUGHS]
 GUYS, GUYS!
 THERE WAS LITERAL FIREWORKS!
 FOR HER FIRST KISS!
 THIS POOR GIRL, EVERY KISS IS
 GOING TO PALE IN COMPARISON FROM
 THIS DAY FORWARD.
 SHE COME ON MONDAY NIGHT --
 BECAUSE, YOU KNOW IT'S ALREADY
 TAPED -SHE WATCHED THE SHOW
 LIVE WITH HER FAMILY.
 LOOK, WHEN YOUR PARENTS AND ALL
 OF AMERICA WATCH AS YOUR FIRST
 KISS -LOOK, SHE IS THERE WITH
 HER PARENTS!
 WATCHING HER FIRST KISS WITH HER
 PARENTS!
 THAT'S NOT THE REACTION I'M
 GOING FOR.
 I'M GOING FOR, "WHAT?
 THAT IS THE WEIRDEST THING!"
 MY PARENTS, MY MOM SAT NEXT TO
 ME AT THE "AMERICAN PIE"
 PREMIERE, FOR EXAMPLE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 RIGHT?
 WHERE THAT HAPPENED.
 BELIEVE ME, THAT WAS PLENTY
 AWKWARD.
 BUT THERE IS NO WAY I WANT MY
 PARENTS TO SEE MY FIRST KISS.
 ALTHOUGH, ACTUALLY, MY FIRST
 KISS -IF I MAY -MY FIRST
 KISS WAS WORK-RELATED.
 TECHNICALLY IT WAS FILMED, SO I
 WAS ON THE SHOW "AS THE WORLD
 TURNS."
 [APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU.
 WERE THEY PART OF YOUR STORIES?
 I HAD TO AUDITION FOUR DIFFERENT
 GIRLS FOR THE ROLE OF MY
 GIRLFRIEND IN THE SHOW.
 I ALREADY HAVE THE PART, SO I
 WAS AUDITIONING OVER GIRLS.
 I HAD TO KISS FOUR DIFFERENT
 GIRLS AND ONE DAY!
 IT WAS MY FIRST TIME!
 BASICALLY, MY FIRST, SECOND,
 THIRD, AND FORCED KISS ALL
 HAPPENED WITHIN MOMENTS OF EACH
 OTHER.
 I ACTUALLY RAN INTO ONE OF THE
 GIRLS JUST RECENTLY ON THE
 SUBWAY, AND WE SIGNED HEATHER,
 AND SHE TOLD ME, "YOU KNOW
 WHAT'S FUNNY, YOU WERE MY FIRST
 KISS.
 PEAK AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S WORLD.
 I'VE JUST PLENTY OF REST
 BEFORE."
 SO THIS PROBABLY FOOTAGE OF THAT
 SUMMER.
 DEVON FRANKLIN SAYS MARRIED
 COUPLES SHOULDN'T WATCH PORN.
 HE SAID IT CREATES AN UNREAL
 EXPECTATION OF WHAT INTIMACY
 LOOKS LIKE.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I WILL TELL YOU THIS.
 AFTER 11 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
 THANK GOD FOR PORN!
 [APPLAUSE]
 I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT.
 I THINK IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN
 INCORPORATE INTO THE BEDROOM,
 AND THAT IT CAN BE FUN AND
 GREAT.
 HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT THIS?
 ARE YOU GUYS INTO PORN AT ALL?
 [APPLAUSE]
 I'M SEEING SOME NOS.
 I'D SAY IT'S A PRETTY EVEN
 SPLIT.
 SUZANNE, BRANDON -   --
 Suzanne: HI, JASON!
 YOU DOING A GREAT JOB, BY THE
 WAY!
 Jason: WHERE DO YOU LAND?
 Suzanne: LAST NIGHT WE
 ACTUALLY WATCHED SOME PORN.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
 WE WATCHED "TEMPTATION ISLAND"
 LAST NIGHT TOGETHER.
 AND THEN BRANDON HAS SOME PORN
 THAT HE LIKES.
 TO ME, THE LOVE BOAT ON ME TV
 ON SUNDAY FOR TWO HOURS IS ALL I
 NEED.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 Jason: WOW.
 YOU GUYS ARE REAL KINKY.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 I DID ASK, AND I REGRET IT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 MADONNA WAS A HUGE DIVA IN A
 SPIN CLASS RECENTLY.
 SHE REPORTEDLY WANTED A SPECIFIC
 BIKE.
 SO THE STUDIO ASKED THE WRITER,
 WHO WAS ALREADY ON THE BITE, IF
 SHE WOULD MOVE FOR A "BIG
 CELEBRITY."
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 WOULD YOU MOVE OUT OF YOUR SEAT?
 YOU SAY NO, AND THEN MADONNA
 WALKS IN?
 AND YOU ARE LIKE -RIGHT?
 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I'D
 BE LIKE, "I'M SORRY, NO, YOU
 CANNOT DO THIS.
 IT'S NOT COOL."
 BY THE WAY, SHE CAN AFFORD A
 PRIVATE LESSON.
 RIGHT?
 [APPLAUSE]
 I WOULD PROBABLY END UP MOVING
 FOR HER, AND I WOULD WANT TO SIT
 BEHIND HER.
 BECAUSE I WOULD WANT TO KNOW IF
 HER NEW -IS REAL OR IF SHE GOT
 IMPLANTS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU GUYS.
 WHAT HAPPENED?

 YOU GUYS THINK THAT'S REAL?
 Audience: NO!
 Jason: NO WAY, RIGHT?
 NOW WOULD YOU MOVE AND LET HER
 SIT IN YOUR SEAT?
 YOU ARE LIKE, "NO, I STILL
 WOULDN'T!"
 OKAY.
 A MAN IN ENGLAND STARTED HIS OWN
 HOUSEKEEPING BUSINESS IN THE
 NUDE.
 UH-HUH.
 HE STARTED CLEANING HOMES NAKED
 ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO, I GUESS.
 AND HIS BUSINESS IS ALREADY
 TAKING OFF.
 HE SAYS HE DOESN'T FEEL --
 [LAUGHS]
 HE SAYS HE DOESN'T FEEL AWKWARD
 BECAUSE HE CHATS WITH HIS
 CUSTOMERS, WHO ARE MAINLY
 MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN AND MEN, WHILE
 HE IS CLEANING.
 OKAY, I'M SORRY.
 RULE NUMBER ONE.
 YOU'RE GOING TO CLEAN MY HOUSE
 AND THEY COULD?
 YOU ARE NOT SITTING ON MY COUCH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT'S NUMBER ONE.
 THAT'S THE FIRST RULE.
 I MEAN...
 [LAUGHS]
 I LOVE THAT HE JUST STARTED THIS
 TWO WEEKS AGO AND HE ALREADY HAS
 WHAT APPEARS TO BE A PROMOTIONAL
 INTERVIEW.
 HE SAT DOWN FOR IT -YEAH, I
 MEAN, KUDOS.
 I'VE GOT TO RESPECT HIS COURAGE,
 I SUPPOSE.
 HE SAID HE STARTED THE BUSINESS
 BECAUSE HE SAW A GAP IN THE
 MARKET.
 [LAUGHTER]
 LUCKY US.
 NOW WE ALL GET TO SEE THE GAP IN
 HIS MARKET!
 [LAUGHTER]
 HEY-O!
 THERE IS MORE GREAT SHOW.
 UP NEXT, FIND OUT WHAT IS
 TRENDING THIS WEEK!
 GRAB A SNACK AND COME ON BACK.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

     I call him "RoboChild."
   Hey buddy! What do you wanna       be when you grow up?
      I would like to be a        TurboTax Live CPA.
        Don't you want to       be something else?
       Yeah RoboChild, you        could be anything!
    I want to help people get   their best possible refund.
        Let's just break         it down, okay?
        All TurboTax Live              CPAs
        are human beings      with real emotions...
     you're never going to be    emotionally complex enough
          for that job.
  I am sad. HAHAHAHA. HAHAHAHA.
    Still perfecting emotion.
      <i> TurboTax Live now with</i>         <i> CPA's on Demand.</i>
        It's time for some          Straight Talk.
           Hallelujah,      it's tax refund time.
 So what are you going to do with  all that glorious extra money?
          No, not that!
      Here's a better plan.
  Try Straight Talk Wireless and
  get 25 gigs of high-speed data
   for just $45 bucks a month.
  That's right, all on America's      best 4G LTE networks.
 Plus, save up to 200 dollars on       a Samsung Galaxy S9
    with in-store activation.
     Straight Talk Wireless.
         Only at Walmart.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 Jason: PLEASE WELCOME OUR
 FIRST GUESTS, STOPPING BY TO
 FILL US IN ON WHAT IS TRENDING
 THIS WEEK!
 HERE FROM "POP GOES THE WEEK,"
 PLEASE WELCOME BRIAN BALTHAZAR!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 NICE TO SEE YOU!
 Brian: GOOD TO SEE YOU!
 WILL HAVE A TYPE.
 SIMPLE
 SOME PEOPLE LIKE BLONDES, BRUNETTES.
 I LIKE BIG AND I CANNOT LIE.
 B14
 Jason: MADONNA, WHAT DO YOU THINK CUSTOMER GRILL, NOT REAL?
 Brian: IT'S NOT REAL.
 I CAN'T IMAGINE.
 JUST A LITTLE PADDING.
 KIND OF SAD, ACTUALLY.
 THERE IS A NEW DATING SHOW THAT
 TAKES IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
 IT'S ON MTV, IT'S CALLED "GAME
 OF CLONES."
 IT TAKES EMPTY STARS LIKE PAULY
 D, FOLKS LIKE THAT, AND THEY ARE
 GOING ON THE ACTS OF PEOPLE THAT
 ALL LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.
 [LAUGHS]
 MTV JUST RELEASED A VIDEO.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
 WE FOUND SEVEN IDENTICAL
 SINGLES.
 I'M IN A JAM!
 WE ARE ASKING THESE MTV
 STARS --
 I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE FACE
 RIGHT NOW!
 IS OVERLOOKED LIKE YOUR TYPE,
 COULD YOU FIND YOUR ONE AND
 "CLONELY"?
 YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A DATING SHOW
 LIKE THIS.
 WHAT TWILIGHT ZONE AND MIGHT
 AND RIGHT NOW?
 "GAME OF CLONES."
 Brian: INTERESTING, RIGHT?
 Jason: IT IS KIND OF
 INTERESTING.
 IS THE PRODUCER ON THIS QUESTION
 WHAT SHE'S THINKING YOU HAD.
 20 YEARS FROM NOW, SHE'S GOT A
 BUILT IN SHOW.
 Brian: IN THIS CASE ITS
 HAIR EXTENSIONS AND
 BREAST IMPLANTS.
 Jason: I FEEL LIKE THEY
 WERE TO RECORD FROM TITLE.
 "GAME OF CLONES, THAT'S A SHOW!
 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SHOW'S
 BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT!"
 Brian: BE ALTHOUGH THE
 CAMERAS ARE EVERYWHERE WE ARE.
 EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE GUY IN
 NEW JERSEY WAS CONTRACTED TO DO
 SOME WORK.
 HE THOUGHT, "OH, YEAH, I'M GOING
 TO GO --"
 BUT HE'S TERRIBLE ABOUT IT.
 HE GETS A GLASS OF WATER WITH
 SOME ICE IN IT.
 HE DOES KNOW CAMERAS ARE THERE.
 OOPS, I'M JUST GOING TO SPILL
 THE WATER!
 OH, NO!
 ENEMY DOES THE BIG FALL.
 WHOA!
 I CAN'T GET UP!
 SO HE BASICALLY LAID THERE UNTIL
 SOMEBODY CAME.
 GOD KNOWS HOW LONG THAT TOOK.
 HE PROBABLY GOT UP AND GOT A
 DRINK.
 Jason: OH, MY GOSH!
 THAT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF MY FIRST
 AUDITIONS.
 Brian: IS CALLED THE
 PRATFALL!
 HE FILED THIS INSURANCE CLAIM,
 HE WAS ARRESTED, AND HE'S IN
 COURT TODAY.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK
 OUT SO WELL FOR HIM!
 WE WILL SEE A GHOST.
 Jason: OH, MAN.
 Brian: THE LESSON IS,
 CAMERAS ARE EVERYWHERE.
 YOU NEVER KNOW.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Jason: THAT'S FRAUD.
 IT'S ILLEGAL.
 IS IT WEIRD THAT I HAVE A LITTLE
 SYMPATHY FOR THE GUY?
 Brian: NO.
 IF YOU REALLY GIVE IT HIS ALL, A
 GOOD FALL, YOU BE LIKE, "OKAY,
 YOU TRIED!"
 Jason: BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT
 IT IS SO SAD.
 BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE ASIDE
 CUSTOMER WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW
 YOU.
 IF YOU MILK A COW, A SCHOOL'S
 COME OUT.
 IT'S FREEZING RIGHT NOW.
 FASHION IS ALWAYS INSPIRED BY
 THE WEATHER.
 AND THERE ARE THESE HUGE PUFFY
 COATS.
 TO GO TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEM.
 THERE ARE $3,000, AND THEY ARE
 SOLD OUT.
 I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE A LITTLE
 RIDICULOUS.
 THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WOULD BE ON
 WHEELS.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GO THROUGH
 A SUBWAY TURNSTILE IN THAT.
 IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH COVERAGE
 FOR YOU, THERE'S ONE ON THE
 RUNWAY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU
 CRAZY.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 Jason: NO!
 [LAUGHTER]
 COME ON!
 THAT'S NOT A COACH!
 Brian: THEY NEVER ACTUALLY
 GOT THE MODEL OUT OF IT.
 I WOULD SLEEP IN THAT!
 Jason: JUST STAY IN BED,
 YOU GUYS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 Brian: KIND OF A FASHION
 TANGENT, THERE IS A WOMAN IN THE
 U.K. NAMED HOLLY.
 SHE IS QUITE GORGEOUS, ACTUALLY.
 HER BOYFRIEND WAS CELEBRATING
 HIS BIRTHDAY.
 THERE SHE IS, VA VA VOOM.
 HE LOOKS REALLY DEJECTED BECAUSE
 SHE GOT HIM A T-SHIRT.
 HE WANT TO GO OUT WITH THE BOYS.
 NOT WITHOUT THE T-SHIRT!
 IT SAYS, "IF YOU'RE READING
 THIS, YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT MY
 MAN FOR TOO LONG.
 THIS IS HOW IT BE LOOK AT YOU IF
 I WAS HERE.
 HI YOU, I'M HOLLY, HIS
 GIRLFRIEND!"
 [APPLAUSE]
 Jason: THIS PHOTO DOESN'T
 LOOK STAGE AT ALL.
 Brian: WOULD YOU EVER BE
 FORCED TO WEAR A SHIRT LIKE
 THIS?
 Jason: NO, JENNY MAKES ME
 WEAR BOXERS THAT SAY "NICE TRY."
 [LAUGHTER]
 JUST IN CASE.
 Brian: DO HAVE A PICTURE OF
 THAT?
 WE DON'T HAVE A PICTURE OF THAT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 FINALLY, WE DIDN'T ALL WATCH THE
 SUPER BOWL.
 EVERY YEAR THE SUPER BOWL HAS
 SOMETHING THAT GOES VIRAL.
 IN THIS CASE, IT WAS ADAM
 LEVINE'S SHIRT.
 TAKE A LOOK AT THIS TANK TOP.
 PEOPLE THOUGHT IT LOOKED
 FAMILIAR.
 I THINK OF SEEN IT MAY BE AROUND
 MY HOUSE?
 IS THAT A SLIPCOVER?
 A HANDBAG?
 A CURTAIN?
 I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A BOOTH IN
 TGI FRIDAY'S WITH THAT A POSTER
 ON IT.
 Jason: THE PELLET IS PRETTY
 SPOT ON.
 THAT'S FANTASTIC.
 Brian: AS WE ALL NO, HAD TO
 TAKE IT OFF.
 THEN WE SEE HIS TATTOOS.
 AND SOMEONE IS LIKE, "WAIT, IS
 THAT THE CHIPOTLE BAG?"
 TAKE A LOOK.
 [LAUGHTER]
 YOU'LL NOTICE THAT HE HAS A
 CALIFORNIA TATTOO.
 BY THE WAY, IF ESTATE WAS ON
 MINE, IT WOULD BE ALL WONKY.
 HE HAS ONE THAT SAYS
 "CALIFORNIA."
 THIS GUY SAID, "I LOOKED JUST
 LIKE ADAM LEVINE, I'M FROM
 ILLINOIS!"
 TAKE A LOOK.
 EXACTLY THE SAME.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 Jason: WHICH ONE IS ADAM?
 Brian: IT'S SO HARD TO
 TELL, RIGHT?
 HARD TO TELL.
 LET'S MOVE ON FROM THE ABS AND
 GET TO THIS AMAZING NEW SANDWICH
 FROM KFC.
 I LOVE ME A CHITO.
 IT'S THE KFC CHITO'S SANDWICH.
 Jason: WENT ON MY GOSH,
 THEY'RE HERE.
 Brian: ITS CHICKEN BREAST
 WITH CHITO SAUCE, MALE, ON A
 BUN.
 IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE IN THREE
 STATES.
 THEY ARE TESTING IT OUT.
 EVERYBODY IN THESE STATES, GO
 GET IT.
 WE MADE ONE FOR US.
 Jason: YOU MADE A SPECIAL?
 OH, MY GOSH.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Brian: YOU KNOW IT'S GOING
 TO BE DELICIOUS.
 I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT IT'S
 AMAZING!

 IT'S THE RULE.
 IT'S A WENDY LAW.
 Taylor: GROSS!
 MY TOES ARE SHOVED IN THERE LIKE
 A LITTLE HAM OX!
 [LAUGHTER]

 [LAUGHTER]
 Jason: THANK YOU SO MUCH
 FOR BEING HERE BEING HERE.
 Taylor: THANKS SO MUCH FOR

 Jason: OF COURSE, WE DID
 "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK"
 TOGETHER.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Taylor: WE STILL HAVE MORE
 WORK TO DO!
 Jason: I THINK I'M COMING
 BACK FOR A LITTLE QUICK POP.
 WHERE ARE YOU AT IN THE SEASON?
 Taylor: WE ARE DONE.
 A LOVELY ONE BACKSTAGE IS LIKE,
 "HAS THAT SHALL BEEN ON TEN
 YEARS NOW?"
 Wendy: FEELS LIKE IT.
 Taylor: SEVEN YEARS.
 Jason: CRAZY, RIGHT?
 IS IT SORT OF MIXED EMOTIONS
 WITH IT ENDING?
 Taylor: ABSOLUTELY.
 I'M SO PROUD OF THE SHOW, AND WE
 HAVE DONE SO MANY GREAT THINGS.
 I THINK JENJI AND THE WRITERS
 HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY ISSUES INTO
 THE CULTURAL CONVERSATION.
 AND IT'S TIME.
 I THINK IT'S TIME.
 Jason: IT'S CERTAINLY GOING
 OUT ON THE HIGH NOTE.
 EVERYONE THAT I'VE TALKED TO
 ISN'T BUMMED THAT IT'S ENDING,
 BUT ALSO FEELS LIKE IT'S IN A
 VERY ORGANIC AND KIND OF HEALTHY
 WAY.
 Taylor: IT FEELS LIKE WAY.
 Jason: AS LONG AS I LIVE, I
 WILL NEVER FORGET WHEN I CAME IN
 ON DISH AND WITH YOU.
 YOU HAD BEEN CAST.
 I CAME IN AND READ WITH YOU.
 Taylor: I WAS JUST TALKING
 ABOUT THAT, TOO!
 Jason: I LEFT THAT AUDITION
 REALLY EXCITED AND WANTING THE
 PART, BUT GOING, "THIS GIRL --
 THE SHOW WAS GOING TO BE
 MASSIVE.
 THIS GIRL IS UNBELIEVABLE."
 Taylor: JASON!
 I LOVE YOU!
 [APPLAUSE]
 Jason: I WAS LITERALLY
 TALKING TO JENNY, I WAS LIKE, "I
 WOULD BE PSYCHED IF I GOT THIS.
 REGARDLESS, IT'S A SHOW WE ARE
 GOING TO BE WATCHING."
 Taylor: THAT'S SO MAGICAL,
 REMEMBER THAT AUDITION.
 I REMEMBER YOU COMING IN, HOW
 GOOD YOU WERE, HOW FUN IT WAS.
 AND YOU LEFT.
 YOU KNOW THAT THING THAT HAPPENS
 IN MAGICIANS?
 I DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND
 AUDITIONS IN THE PROCESS OF
 CASTING.
 BUT IT WAS SO EXCITING.
 JASON CAME IN, IT WAS SO MAGICAL
 PRAYED HE LEFT, AND IT WAS LIKE,
 "WELL, THAT'S THE SHOW.
 WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO."
 [APPLAUSE]
 Jason: IS IT CRAZY TO THINK
 THAT -LIKE, WHAT WAS YOUR
 TAKE?
 WHEN THE SHOW FIRST CAME OUT AND
 WAS BEING MADE, IT WAS MAYBE
 "HOUSE OF CARDS."
 NETFLIX WAS STILL THE SORT OF --
 Taylor: THAT THING WHERE
 YOU MAIL YOUR DVDs IN AND THE
 RED AND BLUE.
 REMEMBER WHEN THAT WAS ALL THAT
 NETFLIX WAS?
 Jason: THIS WAS LIKE THE
 SECOND SHOW.
 Taylor: IT WAS.
 I AM EVER TALKING ABOUT IT WITH
 THE PEOPLE WHO WEAR -IT WAS
 LIKE A WEB SERIES.
 WE TALKED ABOUT IT LIKE A WEB
 SERIES.
 Jason: OH, GREAT, GOOD LUCK
 WITH THAT!
 Taylor: I STILL DON'T KNOW
 WHAT A WEB SERIES IS, BUT THAT'S
 WHAT IT WAS.
 IT WAS SO DIFFERENT.
 I REMEMBER, I WAS COACHED THAT
 FIRST SEASON BY WHOEVER DOES
 THAT NETFLIX PAIRED THE
 PUBLICITY PEOPLE.
 TO NOT USE THE WORD "BINGE."
 REMEMBER WHEN THEY TOLD US THAT?
 Jason: THEY WERE BASICALLY
 TRAINING US TO TRAIN THE
 AUDIENCE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO
 WATCH TV IN A NEW WAY.
 Taylor: YEAH.
 IT WAS SO WILD.
 AND NOBODY KNEW HOW TO PROCESS
 THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THE
 EPISODES WOULD COME OUT AT ONCE.
 AND IT WAS A DIFFERENT -IT WAS
 JUST A DIFFERENT TIME.
 Jason: YEAH.
 SO CRAZY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Taylor: YES.
 Jason: NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO
 DO -IF YOU DON'T MIND -PLAY
 A LITTLE GAME.
 Taylor: OH, GOD, JASON.
 OKAY, I'M READY.
 Jason: I KNOW YOU HATE
 GAMES.
 [LAUGHS]
 Taylor: I KNOW YOU HATE
 FUN!
 Jason: YOU HATE FUN, SO
 WERE GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN.
 [LAUGHS]
 WOULD YOU MIND COMPARING ME --
 COMPARE ME TO SOME OF YOUR OTHER
 ON-SCREEN COSTARS.
 SO, LOWER PRE
  LAURA PREPON.
 WE HAVE A PHOTO?
 THERE'S YOU AND LAURA.
 Taylor: OH, GOD.
 Jason: THERE'S YOU AND I.
 HE WAS THE BETTER KISSER?
 Taylor: JASON!
 Jason: DON'T WORRY.
 PRETEND THEY'RE NOT HERE.
 [LAUGHS]
 Taylor: I MEAN, I DON'T
 KISS AND TELL, FIRST OF ALL.
 Jason: I CAN ALREADY TELL
 THE ANSWER IS LAURA.
 YOU ARE DELAYING JUST ENOUGH!
 [LAUGHTER]
 Taylor: NO IT'S NOT, YOU'RE
 A GREAT KISSER!
 I DON'T EVEN A MEMBER!
 Jason: WHAT, YOU DON'T
 REMEMBER?
 IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT IS OUR
 FIRST KISS!
 [LAUGHTER]
 OH, MY GOD.
 OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
 LET'S MOVE ON, PLEASE.
 Taylor: IT WAS A LONG TIME
 AGO!
 IT'S NOT EVEN REAL KISSING ON
 CAMERA, IS IT?
 Jason: OKAY, YOU PLAYED BEN
 AFFLECK'S WIFE IN "ARGO."
 [APPLAUSE]
 I THINK THE PICTURE ANSWERS THIS
 QUESTION.
 WHO IS THE BETTER ACTOR?
 [LAUGHTER]
 THERE IS BEEN WITH HIS -WHAT
 KIND OF WORD IS THAT?
 IT'S LIKE A -WHAT IS THAT,
 FROM A FILM FESTIVAL OR
 SOMETHING?
 WHAT'S THAT, AND OSCAR?
 DON'T EVEN.
 AND THERE'S ME WITH THE MTV
 MOVIE AWARD FOR BEST ACTOR.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Taylor: [LAUGHS]
 THAT'S A GREAT PHOTO!
 Jason: RIDICULOUS.
 THIS IS A GOOD ONE.
 I THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER
 THIS ONE VERY QUICKLY.
 YOU HAD A LOVE SCENE WITH THE
 ZAC EFRON IN "THE LUCKY ONES."
 [APPLAUSE]
 WHO HAS THE BETTER BODY?
 [LAUGHTER]
 Taylor: JASON!
 JUST REVELING IN BEING ALIVE.
 Jason: YOU KNOW JUST LOVING

 Jason: I PUT ON A SELFIE
 STICK.
 [LAUGHTER]

 PICTURE OF THE WATERFALL.
 Jason: "HONEY, THERE'S A
 WATERFALL.
 YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO."
 CAN WE TALK ABOUT YOUR DOG?
 Taylor: YES, LET'S CONTINUE
 TO EXPLOIT MY ANIMAL."
 SHE IS SO CUTE!
 Jason: HOW OLD IS SHE NOW?
 Taylor: LIKE A YEAR AND A
 HALF.
 Jason: CHI'S ONSET OF THE
 TIME, RIGHT?
 ISH?
 Taylor: SHE GETS VERY
 EXCITED IN MY DRESSING ROOM
 SOMETIMES.
 SOMETIMES IT'S BEST FOR HER TO
 BE AT HOME.
 THERE ARE SO MANY DOGS.
 AND HAIR AND MAKEUP, EVERYBODY
 HAS A DOG.
 Jason: BUT NONE OF THE DOGS
 TALK.
 YOU ARE TEACHING TANK TO TALK?
 Taylor: I DON'T KNOW AND
 MORE HARNESSING HER NATURAL
 ABILITIES TO SAY CERTAIN THINGS.
 I'M NAMING WHAT SHE CAN ALREADY
 DO.
 Jason: CAN WE SEE THE VIDEO

 Jason: I SAID HER!

 MOVIE, "THE PRODIGY."

 Taylor: IT'S TRULY VERY
 SCARY.
 Jason: WHY?
 TELL ME ABOUT IT.
 Taylor: IS A HORROR
 MOVIE -HORROR MOVIES ARE
 REALLY FUN.
 BUT THIS -IT'S TERRIFYING.
 I HAVE SEEN IT TWICE NOW WITH
 AUDIENCES, AND THERE ARE MOMENTS
 WHERE PEOPLE JUST SCREAM SO MUCH
 THAT THERE ARE BITS OF DIALOGUE
 THAT GET LOST.
 I'M LIKE "EVERYBODY COME I NEED
 TO LISTEN TO THE MOVIE!"
 Jason: IS THIS YOUR FIRST
 HORROR MOVIE?
 Taylor: YES.
 Jason: IT SEEMS LIKE SO
 MUCH FUN.
 Taylor: IT IS REALLY FUN TO
 READ THE SCRIPT IS REALLY GOOD.
 IT'S AS FUN AS I THOUGHT IT
 WOULD BE.
 YOU REALLY JUST GET TO PLAY
 PRETEND, THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE
 SO HEIGHTENED.
 Jason: WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID
 OF?
 Taylor: UHHHHHHHHHH...
 Jason: COME ON COME OF THIS
 MOMENT IS GOING TO GO VIRAL.
 SAY SOMETHING GOOD.
 Taylor: I'M AFRAID OF REAL
 THINGS.
 I'M AFRAID OF SHARKS.
 I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT
 GOT TOTALLY SCREWED UP BY SEEING
 "JAWS."
 I'M NOT ALONE IN THAT.
 I KNOW THAT A LOT OF --
 Jason: WELL, YOU WERE THREE
 WHEN YOU SAW IT.
 Taylor: SOMEBODY REALLY
 MESSED UP ON THE CHILD-REARING
 END.
 THE BODY BOARD MOMENTS, WHERE
 IT'S UNDERNEATH AND THE MUSIC,
 AND ALL THE SUDDEN --
 YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
 ABANDONMENT...
 A LIFE ON LIVED -KNOW WHAT I
 MEAN?
 NOT REACHING THEIR FULL
 POTENTIAL.
 NOT FULLY EXPRESSING YOURSELF AS
 A HUMAN.
 Jason: [LAUGHS]
 JUST, YOU KNOW.

        -Ah, the old crew!
  Remember when we all used to go         to the cafeteria
    and just chow down midday?
      -You mean, like, lunch?
          -Come on. Voted    "Most Likely to Help People
   Save $668 When They Switch."
         -At this school?
      -Didn't you get caught    in the laminating machine?
          -Ha. [ Sighs ]
    -"Box, have a great summer.            Danielle."
               Ooh.    Danielle, control yourself.
   I'd like to slow it down here
      with a special discount        for a special girl.
   Danielle, this one's for you.
      with a special discount        for a special girl.
      I'm a concrete mason.
  I had severe fatigue, went to            a doctor.
      Became diagnosed with       Hodgkin's lymphoma.
     I had to put my trust in            somebody.
   We recommended chemotherapy, and then a stem cell transplant.
  When his disease progressed,
   I thought that he would be a          good candidate
        for immunotherapy
   to unleash his immune system       against the cancer.
    I'm back to working hard.
  I've honestly have never felt           this great.
   The evolution of cancer care            is here.
