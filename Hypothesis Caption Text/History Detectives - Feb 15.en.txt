Elyse:  WE'RE THE HISTORY DETECTIVES,  AND WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE  SOME UNTOLD STORIES  FROM AMERICA'S PAST.
Gwendolyn:  THIS WEEK...
She has already been taken into custody by the FBI.
 WHAT EVIDENCE FROM  THE TREASON TRIAL OF TOKYO ROSE  COULD THIS ODD DISC HOLD? IT BECAME A COVER-UP.
Elyse:  IS THIS THE HOLY GRAIL  OF THE WILD WEST?  A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE LEGENDARY  WARRIOR CRAZY HORSE.
NOBODY HAS EVER PRODUCED A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE, EVER.
Wes:  AND IN AN ENCORE PRESENTATION,  DOES THIS DIARY HOLD THE KEY  TO UNDERSTANDING THE FATE  OF A MISSING BOMBER PILOT  FROM WORLD WAR II? Elvis Costello: [Music] WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] [Music] I GET SO ANGRY WHEN THE TEARDROPS START [Music] [Music] BUT HE CAN'T BE WOUNDED 'CAUSE HE'S GOT NO HEART [Music] [Music] WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] [Music] IT'S JUST LIKE WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] Gwendolyn:  THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE POSSIBLE  BY CONTRIBUTIONS  TO YOUR PBS STATION  FROM VIEWERS LIKE YOU.
 OUR FIRST STORY EXPLORES  WHETHER THIS 1940s RECORDING  MAY HAVE HELPED CONVICT  THE WOMAN ALLEGED TO BE  TOKYO ROSE.
 WORLD WAR II,  THE LONELY PACIFIC:  AS MANY AS 2 MILLION SERVICEMEN  LISTEN WISTFULLY  WHILE A WOMAN'S VOICE  FLOATS OVER THE AIRWAVES.
Greetings, everybody.
This is your number-one enemy, your favorite playmate...
 THEY CALL HER  TOKYO ROSE.
 MANY G.I.s CONSIDERED HER  A GODSEND,  A FAMILIAR AMERICAN VOICE  KEEPING THEM COMPANY  FAR FROM HOME.
 BUT IN A CELEBRATED  POSTWAR TRIAL,  PROSECUTORS PORTRAYED HER  AS AN AMERICAN DEVIL,  A SIREN WHO KNOWINGLY WORKED  FOR THE ENEMY,  LURING SOLDIERS AND SAILORS,  THEN UNDERMINING  THEIR FIGHTING SPIRIT.
 IN 1948, THE WOMAN  WHO TWICE SIGNED HER NAME  THE ONE AND ORIGINAL  TOKYO ROSE  WAS BROUGHT BACK FROM JAPAN  TO FACE A GRAND JURY.
 THE WAR HAD ENDED,  BUT HER BATTLE HAD JUST BEGUN.
 NOW BILL MOORE  FROM SUN CITY WEST, ARIZONA,  HAS AN OBJECT THAT MAY EXPLAIN  THE STORY BEHIND  HER CONFESSION.
MY UNCLE WENT TO JAPAN TO GET TOKYO ROSE.
HI, YOU'RE BILL? SO I HEAR YOU HAVE A RECORD TO SHOW ME.
IS THIS IT? YES, THIS IS IT.
WOW, IT'S UNUSUAL.
THIS MUST BE 16 INCHES ACROSS.
SIXTEEN INCHES, I THINK.
 SOMEONE'S WRITTEN TOKYO ROSE  ON THE RECORD.
 BILL FOUND IT WITH HIS MOTHER'S  THINGS AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY,  BUT HE BELIEVES  IT ORIGINALLY BELONGED  TO HIS LARGER-THAN-LIFE UNCLE,  HARRY BRUNDIDGE.
THIS IS MY UNCLE HARRY AND MY AUNT JANET.
WHAT DID HE DO? WELL, HE WAS A WAR CORRESPONDENT AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF COSMOPOLITAN MAGAZINE.
THIS IS YOU, IS THAT RIGHT? OH, YEAH.
SO WERE YOU OUT IN THE PACIFIC? TWO YEARS, AND WE USED TO LISTEN TO TOKYO ROSE ALL THE TIME.
 BILL HAD HEARD THAT HIS UNCLE  MET TOKYO ROSE ON ASSIGNMENT  AND BELIEVES HE PLAYED  A KEY ROLE IN HER PROSECUTION.
AFTER THE WAR, HE WENT BACK OVER TO JAPAN AND HE GOT TOKYO ROSE, BROUGHT HER BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO, AND HAD HER INDICTED FOR TREASON.
 BILL THINKS THE RECORD  MAY HAVE BEEN USED  AS EVIDENCE  IN HER TRIAL,  BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN ABLE  TO HEAR WHAT'S ON THE RECORDING  BECAUSE IT'S TOO LARGE  TO PLAY ON STANDARD EQUIPMENT.
ALL I KNOW IS THAT -
OF COURSE, WHAT I HEARD FROM MY FAMILY, THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE TRIAL.
WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU LIKE FOR ME TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR RECORD? I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S ON IT, OF COURSE, AND ABOUT MY UNCLE IN THE TRIAL.
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THIS WITH ME, AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS, TOO, IF THAT'S OKAY.
OH, YOU CAN, YEAH.
 I FOUND A STUDIO  WITH A TURNTABLE  THAT CAN PLAY  THE OVERSIZED DISC.
 I'M IN LONG ISLAND CITY,  NEW YORK,  TO MEET AUDIO ENGINEER  GUY ROSMARIN AT VIDIPAX.
OOH, WOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE IN A WHILE.
WHAT IS IT MADE OF? PROBABLY ALUMINUM-BASED.
THEY STARTED USING IT AGAIN AFTER THE WAR.
YOU COULDN'T USE ALUMINUM DURING THE WAR FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT WAR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Female Voice: All right, take it now from five.
Tokyo Rose will touch American soil in a few moments and will immediately be taken into custody.
 WELL, THIS CERTAINLY DOESN'T  SOUND LIKE COURTROOM EVIDENCE,  BUT BILL'S UNCLE IS DEFINITELY  PART OF THE ACTION.
We're fortunate today in having two very famous correspondents.
Harry Brundidge...
 GUY HAS MADE A CD COPY FOR ME.
 BILL'S UNCLE HARRY  IS SPEAKING NOW.
She just shook hands with me as she came off the boat and recognized me.
Female Voice: I noticed that.
 IVA TOGURI, THE WOMAN  WHO WAS TRIED AS TOKYO ROSE,  WAS BORN IN LOS ANGELES  TO FIRST-GENERATION  JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS.
 SHE LEFT THE U.S.
 IN THE SUMMER OF '41  TO CARE FOR A SICK AUNT  IN TOKYO.
 AFTER PEARL HARBOR,  WARTIME BUREAUCRACY  MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER  TO RETURN TO THE U.S.
 STRANDED IN JAPAN  DURING THE WAR,  IVA FOUND A JOB  AT RADIO TOKYO AS A TYPIST  UNTIL SHE WAS TAPPED  TO HOST  A JAPANESE WAR  PROPAGANDA PROGRAM.
 IVA'S BROADCASTS WOULD BE  AT THE CENTER OF WHAT WAS THEN  ONE OF THE COSTLIEST TRIALS  IN U.S.
HISTORY.
THAT TRIAL COST THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT $750,000.
IN TODAY'S MONEY THAT'S ALMOST $7 MILLION.
 OF THE EIGHT COUNTS  BROUGHT AGAINST HER,  THE GRAND JURY FOUND HER GUILTY  OF ONLY ONE,  ANNOUNCING THE LOSS  OF AMERICAN SHIPS.
 I'M IN NEW YORK CITY,  MEETING WITH MEDIA HISTORIAN  STEVEN PHIPPS.
I'M EAGER FOR YOU TO HEAR THIS.
Female Voice: There are crowds here that have been standing since 9:00 this morning waiting to see Tokyo Rose, the girl who undermined the morale -
or tried to -
of our boys in the Pacific.
WELL, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A NEWS REPORT, AND IT'S CLEAR THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEPTEMBER 25, 1948.
 STEVEN SAYS THAT'S WHEN IVA  RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES  BY MILITARY ESCORT.
 THE PRESS AND PUBLIC CLAMORED  FOR A CLOSER LOOK  AT THE WOMAN THE MEDIA  HAD ALREADY BRANDED  A WARTIME TRAITOR:  TOKYO ROSE.
BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS THE TOKYO ROSE.
IN FACT, THERE WAS NO ONE PERSON WHO WAS THE TOKYO ROSE.
 AS BILL TOLD ME EARLIER,  THE G.I.s USED THAT NAME  FOR ALL THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING  FEMALE HOSTS  BROADCASTING IN THE PACIFIC.
THE JAPANESE FELT THAT USING A WOMAN ANNOUNCER WOULD MAKE THE G.I.s MORE PRONE TO LISTEN AND THAT IT WOULD TEND TO MAKE THEM HOMESICK.
 WHY DID BRUNDIDGE CLAIM  IVA WAS TOKYO ROSE?  STEVEN HAS DONE SOME DIGGING  ON THE REPORTER'S BACKGROUND.
I FOUND QUITE A FEW ARTICLES ON BRUNDIDGE, SINCE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HIM.
 MUCH OF HIS EARLY CAREER  WAS IN ST.
LOUIS,  REPORTING ON THE MOB.
 STEVEN DISCOVERED BRUNDIDGE  HAD A FLAIR FOR THE DRAMATIC  AND OFTEN PLAYED FAST AND LOOSE  WITH THE FACTS.
HERE'S ONE FROM 1930.
THIS ONE IS CALLED CALL BRUNDIDGE STORY HEARSAY.
SO FOR YEARS HE'D BEEN KNOWN AS SOMEONE WHO WAS PUSHING THE TRUTH ON HIS STORIES.
WELL, YES.
 WHAT WAS HIS INVOLVEMENT  IN THE TOKYO ROSE STORY? LET ME SHOW YOU IN THIS ARTICLE.
 IT'S A MAY 1948  FRONT-PAGE STORY  FROM THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN.
 THAT'S FOUR MONTHS BEFORE  THE DATE ON OUR RECORDING.
 IN IT, BRUNDIDGE DETAILS  HIS TIME IN JAPAN  HUNTING FOR EMPEROR HIROHITO,  THEN FOR TOKYO ROSE.
 IN HIS STORY, BRUNDIDGE TAKES  CREDIT FOR HER INDICTMENT.
THERE'S A REFERENCE TO SECRET WITNESSES THAT BRUNDIDGE CAME UP WITH.
BUT DO WE KNOW WHO THEY WERE? I HAVE NO CLUE.
 STEVEN GIVES ME THE NAME  OF A JOURNALIST  WHO REVISITED THIS STORY  IN THE 1970s.
 RON YATES,  ONCE THE TOKYO BUREAU CHIEF  OF THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,  WROTE A SERIES OF ARTICLES  IN 1976  ON THE TOKYO ROSE TRIAL.
 WE'VE AGREED TO MEET  AT THE JAPANESE AMERICAN  NATIONAL MUSEUM IN LOS ANGELES.
WELL, HERE'S THE RECORD I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT, RON.
OH, WOW, LOOK AT THAT.
I'M INVESTIGATING A MAN NAMED HARRY BRUNDIDGE.
THEY MENTION HIM ON THIS RECORDING.
DO YOU KNOW WHO HE WAS? OH, YEAH, HARRY BRUNDIDGE IS A VERY INTERESTING CHARACTER.
 RON EXPLAINS  HOW HARRY BRUNDIDGE  HAD FIRST BECOME INVOLVED  WITH TOKYO ROSE  THREE YEARS BEFORE THE TRIAL  IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH  OF WORLD WAR II.
 THAT'S WHEN BRUNDIDGE  HOOKED UP WITH  VETERAN WAR CORRESPONDENT  CLARK LEE.
 THEY HEADED TO JAPAN  IN 1945  IN PURSUIT OF THE SCOOP  OF A LIFETIME.
THEY THOUGHT, WE'LL FIND TOKYO ROSE AND THAT'LL BE OUR STORY.
THEY SAID, WE WILL PAY HER $2,000 IF SHE'LL COME TO THE IMPERIAL HOTEL TO BE INTERVIEWED.
 IN WAR-TORN TOKYO, WHERE  MOST PEOPLE WERE STARVING,  THAT MONEY MIGHT GET HER HOME  TO THE UNITED STATES.
BUT WHEN SHE WALKED INTO THE ROOM, THIS WAS NOT WHAT THEY WERE EXPECTING.
 IN HER PIGTAILS  AND SADDLE SHOES,  IVA NEITHER LOOKED  NOR SOUNDED THE PART  OF THE MATAHARI OF THE EAST.
 RON SHOWS ME A REENACTMENT  OF A ZERO HOUR BROADCAST  THAT IVA LATER AGREED TO DO  FOR THE U.S.
ARMY IN TOKYO.
Greetings, everybody.
This is your number-one enemy, your favorite playmate, Orphan Ann, ready again for a vicious assault on your morale.
 RON EXPLAINS THAT  ALL THE SCRIPTS  WERE WRITTEN  BY ALLIED P.O.W.s,  WHO ALSO HAD BEEN FORCED  TO WORK FOR RADIO TOKYO.
 THE LANGUAGE WAS INTENDED  TO BE TONGUE-IN-CHEEK,  THE KIND OF TEASING  THAT AMERICANS  WOULD EASILY RECOGNIZE.
AND THEY'D ALWAYS GO OVER THE SCRIPTS WITH HER AND SAY, HERE'S WHAT WE WANT YOU TO SAY, IVA.
AND THEN SHE WOULD SAY THESE THINGS, LIKE HELLO, MY HONORABLE BONEHEADS OF THE PACIFIC.
THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE ENEMY, ORPHAN ANN.
I'M GOING TO SNEAK UP BEHIND YOU WITH MY NAIL FILE.
YOU SEE IN HER FACE THAT SHE KNOWS SHE'S SAYING THINGS THAT WOULD SOUND MEAN TO THE JAPANESE BUT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY AN INSIDE JOKE AMONG ALL THE AMERICANS.
RIGHT, THERE'S A REAL FACETIOUSNESS TO IT.
 WHEN BRUNDIDGE AND LEE  INTERVIEWED IVA IN 1945,  THAT TEASING TONE NEVER MADE IT  INTO THEIR NOTES.
 THEY HAD OTHER PLANS.
THE STORY JUST WASN'T THERE.
THIS WAS NOT THE SIREN OF THE PACIFIC.
 BRUNDIDGE TOOK OUT THE CONTRACT  FOR $2,000,  THEN ASKED IVA  A FATEFUL QUESTION.
JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT, WOULD YOU JUST SIGN THIS AS TOKYO ROSE? AND SHE SAID, SURE.
WHAT HE DID WAS HE TOOK THOSE NOTES AND GAVE THEM TO THE OCCUPATION FORCES, AUTHORITIES, AND SAID, I HAVE THE SIGNED CONFESSION OF TOKYO ROSE HERE.
AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS SHE WAS ARRESTED.
 SHE WAS FIRST IMPRISONED  IN TOKYO UNDER MARTIAL LAW  AND HELD FOR A YEAR  WHILE THE ARMY  COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS  INVESTIGATED.
 FINDING NO EVIDENCE  OF TREASON,  THE WAR DEPARTMENT CLEARED  AND FINALLY RELEASED HER.
 THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN  THE END OF IT.
SO BRUNDIDGE MET HER IN '45, '46 SHE'S RELEASED FROM PRISON, HOW DID IT BECOME A STORY AGAIN IN 1948? THAT IS A STORY IN ITSELF.
 AFTER BEING FREED  BY THE U.S.
ARMY,  IVA HAD APPLIED  FOR REPATRIATION.
 BUT THE POPULAR RADIO HOST  WALTER WINCHELL  LEARNED OF THE REQUEST  AND STARTED A CAMPAIGN  TO PREVENT HER RETURN  AND TRY HER FOR TREASON.
GOLD STAR MOTHERS -
THESE ARE MOTHERS WHO HAD LOST THEIR SONS FIGHTING IN THE PACIFIC -
BEGAN WRITING TO WALTER WINCHELL, HE FORWARDED THOSE TO THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT PRESSURE BEGAN TO BUILD.
 IT WAS AN ELECTION YEAR.
 RON SAYS CHARGES OF BEING SOFT  ON COMMUNISTS AND TRAITORS  WAS A CRITICAL FACTOR  IN TRUMAN'S CLOSE PRESIDENTIAL  RACE AGAINST THOMAS DEWEY.
THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T WANT TO BE PERCEIVED AS BEING SOFT ON TRAITORS.
 THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  ISSUED A REQUEST FOR WITNESSES  TO IVA'S ALLEGED ACTS  OF TREASON.
SO HERE COMES BRUNDIDGE AGAIN.
 WHEN BRUNDIDGE MET UP WITH  ATTORNEY GENERAL TOM CLARK,  HE OFFERED TO GET  A NEW CONFESSION FROM IVA  AND TO FIND WITNESSES  TO HELP CONVICT HER.
TOM CLARK ASSIGNS SOME OF HIS MINIONS TO GO BACK TO TOKYO, AND HARRY BRUNDIDGE GOES WITH THEM.
 RON SAYS IT WASN'T UNTIL  A QUARTER-CENTURY  AFTER IVA'S TRIAL  THAT HE UNLOCKED  A CRUCIAL PIECE  OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY.
 RON ARRANGED TO MEET TWO MEN  WHO HAD HELD ON TO A SECRET:  GEORGE MITSUSHIO  AND KEN OKI,  IVA'S OLD BOSSES  FROM RADIO TOKYO.
THEY SAID, WE -
OUR TESTIMONY IS WHAT CONVICTED HER, AND IT WAS ALL A LIE.
THEY HAD BEEN COACHED FOR TWO MONTHS BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN WHAT THEY SHOULD SAY AT THE TRIAL.
AND THEIR TESTIMONY WAS THE SIXTH OF THE EIGHT COUNTS WHICH SHE WAS INDICTED ON, THAT SHE DID SPEAK INTO A MICROPHONE ABOUT THE LOSS OF SHIPS.
 BUT WHAT ABOUT  BRUNDIDGE'S CLAIMS  OF FINDING ADDITIONAL  SECRET WITNESSES? I KNOW THE PERFECT PERSON TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM.
 I'M MEETING WITH BARBARA  TREMBLEY AT DARKWOOD STUDIOS.
 BARBARA MET IVA  20 YEARS AGO.
 OVER TIME THEY BECAME FRIENDS.
 IVA AGREED TO TELL  HER FULL STORY  AND GAVE BARBARA THE RIGHTS  TO MAKE HER SAGA  INTO A FEATURE FILM.
I HAVE A RECORDING THAT IS DESCRIBING THE MOMENT WHEN IVA COMES BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.
 I TELL BARBARA THAT  ON THIS RECORDING  BRUNDIDGE BOASTS OF GETTING IVA  TO SIGN A NEW CONFESSION.
WHY IS IVA EVEN WILLING TO SEE HIM, MUCH LESS TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT? SHE HAD JUST LOST HER BABY.
 BARBARA EXPLAINS THAT IVA  HAD JUST SUFFERED A MISCARRIAGE  AND DESPERATELY WANTED  TO GET HOME TO THE STATES.
 IVA TOLD BARBARA THAT  BRUNDIDGE HAD ASSURED HER  THAT SIGNING THE DOCUMENT  WAS A PASSPORT HOME.
AND THEN AS SOON AS SHE SIGNED IT, BRUNDIDGE LEANED OVER TO IVA AND HE SAID, YOU'VE DONE YOURSELF A GOOD DEAL.
THEY'LL NEVER EXECUTE A WOMAN.
SHE LOST HER HEART AT THAT POINT.
BRUNDIDGE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT SECRET WITNESSES THAT WOULD PROVE THE CASE AGAINST IVA.
YES, MR.
YAGI.
YAGI WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE THAT BRUNDIDGE HAD KNOWN BEFORE THE WAR.
 BARBARA SAYS THAT WHEN  BRUNDIDGE TRAVELED TO JAPAN,  HIROM YAGI ACTED AS A FIXER,  MAKING LOCAL INTRODUCTIONS  FOR THE JOURNALIST.
BRUNDIDGE LITERALLY BRIBED HIM.
HE SAID, YOU WILL GET A TRIP TO THE U.S.
AND WE'LL HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TESTIFY FOR THE GRAND JURY, AND THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY.
 BARBARA FOUND  THE HANDWRITTEN TESTIMONY  YAGI HAD GIVEN BRUNDIDGE  AND THE U.S.
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
I HEARD HER SAY INTO THE MICROPHONE, 'YOUR WIVES ARE OUT WITH WAR WORKERS.' SO DOES HE TESTIFY AT THE TRIAL BEFORE THE GRAND JURY? YES, HE DOES.
BUT AS SOON AS HE GETS BACK TO JAPAN, HE RECANTS.
YAGI EVEN WRITES A LETTER TO BRUNDIDGE ASKING HIM TO PLEASE STOP THIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
DEAR MR.
BRUNDIDGE, THIS IS AN ELEVENTH HOUR APPEAL ASKING YOU TO USE YOUR GOOD INFLUENCES TO CALL OFF THE COMING TRIAL, IF POSSIBLE.
 BARBARA EXPLAINS THAT BY NOW  THE GOVERNMENT  HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS  ABOUT BRUNDIDGE  AND EVEN BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE  HIM FOR WITNESS TAMPERING,  BUT THEY HAD TOO MUCH INVESTED  IN THE TRIAL TO BACK OUT NOW.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, TOM CLARK, AND SO ON, THEY PUT A LID ON IT AND IT BECAME A COVER-UP.
 THE TRIAL PROCEEDED  AS PLANNED,  BUT DID IT GO ON  WITH BRUNDIDGE? THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES VERY INTERESTING.
 THE CONFIDENTIAL FILES  OF FBI DIRECTOR J.
EDGAR HOOVER  WERE OPENED IN 2005.
 IN THOSE DOCUMENTS  BARBARA HAS FOUND  SOME ANSWERS FOR BILL.
LET ME PLAY FOR YOU WHAT'S ON YOUR RECORD, AND THEN WE HEAR A VOICE YOU MAY RECOGNIZE.
Brundidge on recording: I went back at the request of the attorney general last March, and Rose willingly signed it.
I RECOGNIZE HIS VOICE.
THAT WAS MY UNCLE HARRY.
 I TELL BILL  ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S ROLE  IN LINKING  THE REAL-LIFE IVA TOGURI  AND THE FABLED TOKYO ROSE.
THAT'S SAD, ISN'T IT? YEAH.
HE PROBABLY DID MOST ANYTHING TO GET A STORY, AND THAT WAS A BIG STORY.
YOU'D WANTED TO KNOW WHAT PART HARRY BRUNDIDGE PLAYED IN THIS TRIAL.
WHEN HE MENTIONED THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAD SENT HIM BACK, THAT'S WHERE THE STORY BECOMES LARGER THAN JUST YOUR UNCLE.
SO WHAT WAS BRUNDIDGE'S ROLE IN THE TRIAL? WELL, BRUNDIDGE HAD NO ROLE IN THE TRIAL.
THEY DIDN'T ALLOW HIM TO TESTIFY.
THE FBI, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: HE WAS SUCH A HOT POTATO, NOBODY WANTED TO GET NEAR HIM.
 ON ONE INTERNAL MEMO,  BARBARA DISCOVERED  THAT J.
EDGAR HOOVER  HAD WEIGHED IN  ON BRUNDIDGE'S  SO-CALLED WITNESS  RECANTING HIS TESTIMONY.
I'M NOT SURPRISED AT DEVELOPMENTS.
IT WAS MOST UNWISE FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO USE SUCH A PERSON AS BRUNDIDGE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THEY REALIZED THE WHOLE CASE COULD BE BLOWN UP IF HE TESTIFIED.
HE FINALLY WENT TO THE DEFENSE AND OFFERED TO TESTIFY FOR THEM, AND THEY WOULDN'T TOUCH HIM EITHER.
GEE, THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE.
YOU KNOW, BACK IN WAR TIMES, PEOPLE LOOKED UPON THE JAPANESE REALLY BAD, AND IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY WERE AMERICANS OR -
LOOK AT ALL THE INTERNEES THEY HAD, AND THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE.
THEY WERE.
BILL, I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS RECORD AND GIVING ME A CHANCE TO SEE THIS LARGER HISTORY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I'M GLAD ALL THIS CAME OUT.
I APPRECIATE THE WISDOM WITH WHICH YOU HEARD THE STORY.
 GIVEN THE NEW PUBLIC  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT IVA'S INNOCENCE  AND THE PERJURED TESTIMONY  AGAINST HER,  PRESIDENT FORD AGREED  TO LOOK INTO HER CASE.
 IN HIS LAST OFFICIAL ACT  IN OFFICE,  HE GRANTED IVA TOGURI A FULL  AND UNCONDITIONAL PARDON  ON JANUARY 19, 1977.
 SHE PASSED AWAY  IN 2006.
TWELVE AMERICANS WERE TRIED FOR TREASON AFTER WORLD WAR II.
SEVEN WERE RADIO BROADCASTERS.
AXIS SALLY WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFAMOUS.
BORN MILDRED GILLARS, SHE DREAMT OF BECOMING A STARLET.
WITH LITTLE THEATER SUCCESS, GILLARS MOVED TO GERMANY IN THE MID-1930s AND WORKED FOR RADIO BERLIN.
FROM DECEMBER 1941 TO MAY 1945, GILLARS' SULTRY VOICE REACHED AMERICAN G.I.s WITH PRO-GERMAN WAR UPDATES DESIGNED TO DEPLETE MORALE.
GILLARS' BROADCASTS CAME UNDER THE AUSPICES OF JOSEPH GOEBBELS, HITLER'S PROPAGANDA MINISTER.
SHE POSED AS AN AMERICAN RED CROSS VOLUNTEER, INTERVIEWING AMERICAN P.O.W.s BUT DISTORTING THEIR COMMENTS.
SHE CRITICIZED ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL AND MUSED ABOUT THE UNFAITHFULNESS OF G.I.
WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS BACK HOME.
AXIS SALLY'S MOST INFAMOUS BROADCAST, VISION OF INVASION, TARGETED AMERICAN TROOPS AWAITING D-DAY.
GILLARS PLAYED A G.I.
MOTHER DREAMING OF HER SON'S DEATH.
CRIES OF THE WOUNDED PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND, CREATING THE IMPRESSION OF IMPENDING SLAUGHTER.
The boys will be killed or crippled for the rest of their lives.
AFTER THE WAR, GILLARS WAS EXTRADITED TO THE U.S.
SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF TREASON AND SENTENCED TO 10 TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON.
IN 1961, GILLARS LEFT JAIL TO LIVE IN A CONVENT AND TEACH CATHOLIC SCHOOL.
SHE DIED IN 1988.
Elyse:  OUR NEXT STORY GOES IN SEARCH  OF A NATIVE-AMERICAN LEGEND.
 MORE THAN 125 YEARS  AFTER HIS DEATH,  THE NAME CRAZY HORSE  STILL ECHOES  IN THE BLACK HILLS  OF SOUTH DAKOTA.
 IN LIFE, THE LAKOTA WARRIOR  AND SPIRITUAL MAN  VOWED TO PROTECT  THESE SACRED HUNTING GROUNDS  FROM ENCROACHING SETTLERS  AND GOLD MINERS.
 IN 1876, HE HELPED CRUSH  THE U.S.
CAVALRY TROOPS  OF GENERAL GEORGE CUSTER AT THE  BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN.
 BUT IS THIS A TRUE LIKENESS  OF THE WARRIOR?  DESPITE HIS FAME, CRAZY HORSE  REFUSED TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED,  SHUNNING WHITES  AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES.
 FOR YEARS, RUMORS  OF CRAZY HORSE PHOTOGRAPHS  HAVE TANTALIZED COLLECTORS.
 MORE THAN 125 YEARS  AFTER THE WARRIOR'S DEATH,  TIM GIAGO  OF RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA,  HAS A FRAMED IMAGE  WHICH MAY BE  THE ONLY PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE  OF THIS LEGEND.
IT SAID, TASUNKA WITKO, AND TASUNKA WITKO IS THE LAKOTA NAME THAT MEANS CRAZY HORSE.
 I'M MEETING TIM AT HIS HOME  TO FIND OUT MORE.
HI.
WELCOME TO MY HOUSE.
THANK YOU.
WELL, ABOUT 27 YEARS AGO, A CONSTRUCTION MANAGER CAME INTO MY NEWSPAPER, THE LAKOTA TIMES, AND HE HAD THIS WITH HIM.
ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES, A LAKOTA MAN, HAD PUT IT IN HOCK AND SAID HE COULD HAVE IT IF HE WENT DOWN AND TOOK IT OUT OF PAWN.
SO HE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO MY NEWSPAPER.
ALONG WITH THAT WAS THIS LETTER WHICH IS DATED 1904.
IT'S WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN THE VERY OLD LAKOTA LANGUAGE.
IT SAYS THAT TASUNKA WITKO, WHICH MEANS CRAZY HORSE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CRAZY HORSE? CRAZY HORSE WAS REALLY ONE OF THE GREAT WARRIORS OF THE LAKOTA.
PEOPLE SAID THAT BULLETS COULDN'T HIT HIM.
ONE OF THE REASONS HE'S SO ADMIRED AND LOVED BY THE LAKOTA PEOPLE TODAY IS HE WOULD NEVER SIGN A TREATY.
HE NEVER SOLD OUT ANY LAND OR ANY OF HIS PEOPLE, AND TO ME THAT'S HIGHLY ADMIRABLE.
 BUT WHAT CRAZY HORSE LOOKS LIKE  HAS LONG BEEN A MYSTERY.
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS OF CRAZY HORSE? I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.
I'VE SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE DISPROVED, THAT THAT'S NOT CRAZY HORSE, ALWAYS PROVED TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FIND OUT VERY MUCH WHETHER THIS IS INDEED A TRUE PICTURE OF CRAZY HORSE.
 IT'S JUST AS TIM SUGGESTED.
 THERE ARE A NUMBER  OF DISPUTED IMAGES  CLAIMING TO BE CRAZY HORSE.
 MOST OF THEM HAVE  PRETTY SHAKY STORIES,  AND NONE RESEMBLE OUR GUY.
 THERE'S NOTHING OBVIOUS  TO SUGGEST OUR MAN  IS EVEN A WARRIOR CHIEF,  NO WAR BONNET  OR ELABORATE DECORATION.
HE DOES HAVE A COLLAR ON AND AN EAGLE FEATHER, BUT BESIDES THAT, HE'S DRESSED PRETTY PLAINLY.
 I'M TRYING TO TAKE  THE BACK OFF CAREFULLY.
 IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S  MORE LAKOTA WRITING  ALONG WITH THE DATE, 1875.
AH, NOW, THIS IS HELPFUL.
 HERE AGAIN, CRAZY HORSE  AND 1875 IN HANDWRITING.
 BUT THERE'S ALSO  A STAMPED NAME AND ADDRESS.
ALEX GARDNER, 921 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, WASHINGTON, D.C.
 LET ME DO SOME DIGGING.
 THERE WAS AN ALEXANDER GARDNER  WHO WAS A CELEBRATED  PHOTOGRAPHER  IN THE 19th CENTURY.
 HE PHOTOGRAPHED  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
 I'M NOT CERTAIN  THEY WERE THE SAME PERSON,  BUT ALEXANDER GARDNER  WAS A SCOTTISH SOCIALIST  WHO HAD GOTTEN INTERESTED  IN PHOTOGRAPHY  AFTER SEEING  MATTHEW BRADY'S WORK.
 BRADY AND GARDNER BECAME  THE TWO BEST KNOWN  PHOTOGRAPHERS OF THE CIVIL WAR.
 BUT IT SEEMS THAT A NUMBER  OF GARDNER'S BATTLEFIELD IMAGES  FROM THE WAR  WERE CONTROVERSIAL.
HE ACTUALLY MOVED BODIES ON THE CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELDS TO BETTER SUIT HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC NEEDS.
 AND THIS IS INTERESTING:  GARDNER TRAVELED TO  THE LAKOTA TERRITORIES IN 1868  TO PHOTOGRAPH NEGOTIATIONS  BETWEEN NORTHERN PLAIN TRIBES  AND THE GOVERNMENT.
 THE FORT LARAMIE TREATY  ESTABLISHED  THE GREAT SIOUX RESERVATION  AND PROTECTED THE BLACK HILLS  FOR THE LAKOTA.
 IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS  AN ALEXANDER GARDNER PHOTOGRAPH  AND THAT GARDNER MET  CRAZY HORSE,  BUT THE DATE ON OUR PHOTO,  IF IT'S ACCURATE,  IS SEVEN YEARS AFTER  GARDNER PHOTOGRAPHED  THE LAKOTA TREATIES.
I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT I NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THIS NOTE SAYS.
 I'M HEADED TO  OGLALA LAKOTA COLLEGE  IN RAPID CITY.
 LAKOTA LANGUAGE AND CULTURE  PROFESSOR WILMER MESTETH  IS SKEPTICAL OF OUR IMAGE.
 HE EXPLAINS WHY CRAZY HORSE  REJECTED PHOTOGRAPHY.
IN ORAL HISTORY THEY SAID HE MADE A STATEMENT THAT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE EVIL AND THAT ANYBODY THAT TOOK THEIR PHOTOGRAPH, THEIR SOUL WAS CAPTURED IN THE PICTURE.
 CRAZY HORSE'S REJECTION  OF THE WHITE MAN'S TECHNOLOGY  WAS PART OF HIS DEFENSE OF THE  BESIEGED LAKOTA WAY OF LIFE.
 THE 1868 TREATY  OF FORT LARAMIE  HAD GUARANTEED THE LAKOTA  THEIR TRIBAL LANDS,  BUT JUST SIX YEARS LATER,  THE TREATY WOULD BE VIOLATED.
IN 1874, THERE WAS AN EXPEDITION THAT CAME DOWN INTO THE BLACK HILLS IN SEARCH OF GOLD, LED BY GENERAL CUSTER, AND THEY DID FIND GOLD IN THE BLACK HILLS.
 TWO YEARS LATER,  IN JUNE 1876,  CRAZY HORSE HELPED DEFEAT  GENERAL CUSTER  AT THE BATTLE  OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN.
 IT WAS THE WORST U.S.
MILITARY  DEFEAT OF THE INDIAN WARS.
 ALTHOUGH MANY  SIOUX CONTEMPORARIES  WERE PHOTOGRAPHED,  THE LAKOTA HAVE RELIED  ON ORAL HISTORY  FOR A DESCRIPTION  OF CRAZY HORSE.
THEY SAID HE WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT, HIS HAIR WAS LIGHT IN COLOR, AND HIS COMPLEXION WAS LIGHT.
AND HE HAD A MYSTERIOUS AURA ABOUT HIM.
THEY SAID YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL HIS PRESENCE AND HIS STRENGTH AS A POWERFUL MAN.
THIS IS THE LETTER THAT CAME WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS LETTER IS WRITTEN IN OLD LAKOTA ORTHOGRAPHY, IN LAKOTA LANGUAGE.
 WILMER TELLS ME THAT OLD LAKOTA  WAS USED FOR A HUNED YEARS,  UNTIL ABOUT 1960.
[ reading in Lakota ] THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE.
WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY? [ reading in Lakota ] THE WAY YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS HE IS THERE IS A SCAR ON HIS LEFT CHEEK.
IS IT TRUE THAT CRAZY HORSE HAD A SCAR? YES, CRAZY HORSE WAS SHOT BY A MAN CALLED NO WATER IN A JEALOUS RAGE.
HE SHOT TO KILL CRAZY HORSE BUT GRAZED HIM ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHEEK.
 THE MAN ON THE PHOTO  IS FAVORING HIS RIGHT.
 IF THERE'S A SCAR ON THE LEFT,  I CAN'T TELL.
THEN IT SAYS, WE WERE WITH CRAZY HORSE WAY BACK THEN.
THIS IS ME, DEWEY BEARD.
 WILMER THINKS THAT  DEWEY BEARD  MAY HAVE DICTATED THE STORY  TO SOMEONE,  POSSIBLY TO THIS B.B.E.
 SIGNED AT THE BOTTOM.
AND WHO WAS DEWEY BEARD? DEWEY BEARD WAS THERE AT THE LITTLE BIGHORN AT THE AGE OF 10 YEARS OLD.
AND POSSIBLY KNEW CRAZY HORSE.
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS PERSON KNEW CRAZY HORSE, YES.
IN YOUR OPINION, DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COULD BE CRAZY HORSE? I DON'T THINK SO.
THIS PERSON IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS OF DARKER COMPLEXION.
CRAZY HORSE HIMSELF WAS LIGHT-COMPLECTED.
 I'M NOT SURE WHAT  TO MAKE OF THIS.
 WILMER THINKS THE NOTE  IS LEGITIMATE.
 STILL, HISTORY'S VERDICT  STANDS IN OUR WAY.
NOBODY'S EVER PRODUCED A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE, EVER.
 WILMER SUGGESTED I VISIT  THE CRAZY HORSE MEMORIAL  IN THE BLACK HILLS.
 SCULPTOR KORCZAK ZIOLKOWSKI  BEGAN THE MASSIVE CARVING  IN THE 1940s...
 AND TODAY IT REMAINS  THE WORLD'S LARGEST  MOUNTAIN SCULPTURE  IN PROGRESS.
 THE MONUMENT IS A TESTAMENT TO  THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS MEMORY,  BUT WHERE IS THE PHYSICAL MODEL  FOR THE MASSIVE FACE?  DOUG WAR EAGLE IS  CRAZY HORSE'S GRANDSON.
HOW WAS THE MONUMENT BUILT? I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE? IT'S JUST THE CLOSEST REPLICA OF HIM.
THERE NEVER WAS A PHOTO EVER TAKEN OF OUR GRANDFATHER.
 HE SAYS THE MONUMENT REPRESENTS  CRAZY HORSE'S SPIRIT  RATHER THAN HIS EXACT IMAGE.
 WHEN I SHOW DOUG OUR PHOTO,  RIGHT AWAY HE'S SKEPTICAL.
THIS MAN HAS AN EAGLE FEATHER IN HIS HAIR.
OUR GRANDFATHER NEVER WORE AN EAGLE FEATHER IN HIS HAIR.
OUR GRANDPA WEARS THE RED-TAILED HAWK FEATHER WITH THE BUFFALO BONE.
 DOUG'S BROUGHT SOMETHING  TO SHOW ME  THAT FEW OUTSIDE HIS FAMILY  HAVE SEEN.
I'VE BROUGHT TWO SKETCHES OF OUR GRANDFATHER'S.
THE FIRST ONE IS WAGLULA, OLD MAN CRAZY HORSE.
 HE SAYS THE WARRIOR  CRAZY HORSE  WAS ACTUALLY THE THIRD MAN  TO CARRY THAT NAME.
 IN ACCORDANCE  WITH LAKOTA TRADITION,  CRAZY HORSE INHERITED THE NAME  FROM THIS MAN, HIS FATHER,  WHEN HE BECAME A WARRIOR.
AND THE OTHER SKETCH I HAVE HERE IS OF THE WARRIOR.
 IT WAS SKETCHED LONG AFTER  HIS DEATH IN 1934,  WHEN CRAZY HORSE'S  YOUNGER SISTER  DESCRIBED HIS APPEARANCE  TO A FORENSIC ARTIST.
 THE LIKENESS TRIGGERED  AN EMOTIONAL REACTION.
SHE CRIED, BECAUSE SHE SAID THAT'S THE CLOSEST LIKENESS THAT YOU WILL EVER HAVE OF HIM.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
WELL, HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE OUR PHOTOGRAPH.
SO IT HAS THE TWO FEATHERS, THE LONG, FLOWING HAIR, AND A LITTLE BIT OF A SCAR.
THAT'S THE CLOSEST WE'LL EVER GET OF OUR GRANDFATHER, THE WARRIOR, THE ONE THAT FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF LITTLE BIGHORN.
 DOUG IS CONVINCED OUR IMAGE  ISN'T CRAZY HORSE.
 BUT THIS SKETCH  WAS MADE BY SOMEONE  WHO NEVER MET CRAZAZY HORSE,  SIX DECADES AFTER HE DIED.
 I'M TAKING THE IMAGE  TO THE SMITHSONIAN,  WHICH HOUSES  THE WORLD'S LARGEST ARCHIVE  OF NATIVE-AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS.
 I WANT TO SHOW IT TO ONE  OF THE SMITHSONIAN'S CURATORS.
 BUT FIRST,  BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN  MANY BOGUS  CRAZY HORSE PICTURES,  WHILE I'M HERE,  I ALSO WANT TO SHOW IT  TO STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER  DON HURLBURT.
WELCOME TO THE DARKROOM.
WOW.
OKAY, SO HERE'S MY PIECE, AND ON THE BACK IT SAYS 1875.
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS PERIOD.
IT DEFINITELY HAS CHARACTERISTICS FROM THAT TIME FRAME.
IT'S YELLOWING, IT'S GOT A GOOD GOLD TONE TO IT.
IT HAS THE SHININESS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PRINT THAT A MODERN PRINT WOULD NOT HAVE BUT PRINTS OF THAT AGE DO.
HOW WOULD A PRINT LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE 1870s? IT WAS DEFINITELY A MULTI-DAY, MULTI-STEP PROCESS TO MAKE ONE OF THESE PRINTS.
THESE GUYS DID A LOT OF WORK TO GET THESE PHOTOGRAPHS.
THESE PRINTS CAME FROM GLASS PLATE NEGATIVES THAT WERE MADE, PRODUCED FROM ABOUT THE 1850s TO 1880s.
WELL, I CAN SHOW YOU.
 THE INVENTION OF GLASS PLATES  MEANT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME,  PHOTOGRAPHERS LIKE GARDNER  HAD A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEDIUM  FROM WHICH TO MAKE  UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF PRINTS.
 GLASS PLATES REVOLUTIONIZED  PHOTOGRAPHY.
NOW THAT I'VE CLEANED IT AND CHECKED IT, WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT OVER HERE, SET IT DOWN, GET A SHEET OF MODERN PAPER OUT, BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE ALBUMEN PAPER WITH US ANYMORE.
 DON SAYS GARDNER, OR WHOEVER  TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH,  WOULD HAVE MADE  ALBUMEN SILVER PRINTS,  WHICH EXPOSED  IN SUNLIGHT.
 TODAY, USING MODERN  PHOTO PAPER,  DEVELOPING A PRINT IN THE  DARKROOM TAKES MERE MINUTES.
THAT'S GREAT.
 I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PRINT  FROM FORMER ARCHIVIST  AND SMITHSONIAN VOLUNTEER  PAULA FLEMING.
 SHE SAYS THE IMAGE WAS ALMOST  CERTAINLY TAKEN BY GARDNER  NOT OUT WEST  BUT ON THE EAST COAST  AT THE ADDRESS  ON THE BACK OF OUR PHOTOGRAPH.
HE HAD A STUDIO IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND HE TOOK MOST OF HIS INDIAN PORTRAITS THERE.
WELL, WHAT WOULD BRING THEM TO WASHINGTON, D.C.? AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT RENEWED ITS EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THE INDIANS TO RESOLVE ISSUES OF LAND ACQUISITION AND ANNUITIES.
 PAULA SAYS HUNDREDS  OF AMERICAN INDIANS  WERE INVITED TO WASHINGTON  AS TRIBAL DELEGATIONS.
THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SHOW THE INDIANS THE BENEFITS OF CIVILIZATION, SO THEY TOOK THEM ON TRAINS AND THEY TOOK THEM TO BIG CITIES TO SHOW THEM WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE CIVILIZED.
 ON THE SURFACE,  THE WASHINGTON VISITS  WERE EFFORTS TO PEACEFULLY  RESOLVE LAND DISPUTES  AND DEMONSTRATE  THAT THE INDIANS  WERE BEING TREATED  RESPECTFULLY,  BUT PAULA SAYS THE VISITS  OFTEN INCLUDED A STOP  WHICH HAD A POLITICAL AGENDA.
THEY WOULD ALSO TAKE THEM TO THE ARSENAL AND THEY'D SHOW THEM STOCKPILES OF WEAPONS AND CANNONBALLS AND THEY WOULD HAVE DISPLAYS OF MILITARY MIGHT.
THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SHOW THEM THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY FUTILE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LANDS.
THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE? THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE.
 CRAZY HORSE'S GRANDSON  HAD TOLD ME  THAT THE CLOTHING  AND DECORATION IN OUR IMAGE  WAS NOT TYPICAL  FOR THE WARRIOR.
 BUT PAULA SAYS NOT ALL THE  PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN WASHINGTON  WERE WHAT THEY APPEARED TO BE.
SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS ACTUALLY KEPT PROPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIANS LOOKED EXOTIC ENOUGH, AND SOMETIMES THEY PUT THE IMPROPER COSTUMES ON THE WRONG CULTURES.
 PAULA HAS A SURPRISE FOR ME.
WITH THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE ARCHIVES, IT CAN BE A LITTLE DAUNTING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NAME.
BUT I DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH, AND COME HERE, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.
WOW!  IT'S A GLASS PLATE NEGATIVE,  JUST LIKE THE ONE  DON SHOWED ME.
IT'S THE EXACT SAME IMAGE.
SURE IS.
THIS NEGATIVE WAS USED TO PRINT THAT IMAGE.
IS IT CRAZY HORSE?  WHAT PAULA TELLS ME NEXT  CLOSES THE CASE.
WELL, TIM, IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE INVESTIGATION.
 I TELL HIM HE HAS AN AUTHENTIC  ALEXANDER GARDNER PHOTO,  ONE OF THE NATION'S  MOST CELEBRATED  PERIOD PHOTOGRAPHERS.
THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPERTS THAT DON'T BELIEVE THAT CRAZY HORSE WAS EVER PHOTOGRAPHED, AND THAT MADE IT REALLY DIFFICULT.
FINALLY, THOUGH, I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAN IN YOUR PHOTOGRAPH BY TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON, D.C., JUST LIKE HE DID 150 YEARS AGO.
THERE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM HENRY BLACKMORE, AND HE COMMISSIONED GARDNER TO PHOTOGRAPH THE DELEGATIONS OF INDIANS.
AND HE ALSO PUBLISHED THE IMAGES.
THAT'S OUR GUY.
THE MAN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH IS VUA-SHA-PEH, WHOSE ENGLISH NAME IS STABBER, AND HE WAS AN OGLALA LAKOTA WHO CAME TO WASHINGTON, D.C., WITH RED CLOUD ON A DELEGATION.
 THE MAN IN THIS PHOTOGRAPHED  HAD WITNESSED  ONE OF THE LAST  PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS  BETWEEN THE LAKOTA  AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  BEFORE GOLD WAS DISCOVERED  IN THE BLACK HILLS.
HE WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LAKOTA HISTORY.
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE KNOW WHO HE IS NOW.
 VUA-SHA-PEH HAD TRAVELED  TO WASHINGTON  WITH RED CLOUD  AND THE LAKOTA DELEGATION.
 IN CONTRAST, CRAZY HORSE  REJECTED DIPLOMACY  AND DEFENDED LAKOTA TRADITIONS  AS A WARRIOR TO THE END.
EXPERTS SAY THAT HE NEVER WENT TO WASHINGTON; HE STAYED ON HIS LAND TO FIGHT FOR HIS PEOPLE AND TO FIGHT THE U.S.
MILITARY.
I'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF CRAZY HORSE, AND I REALLY HOPED THAT THIS WAS HIM.
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT CRAZY HORSE LOOKED LIKE.
I HOPE THAT I CAN TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH AND FIND HIS DESCENDANTS AND PASS THE PHOTOGRAPH DOWN TO THEM.
WE THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO GIVE US THE NEWS.
 AFTER HIS VICTORY  AT THE LITTLE BIGHORN,  CRAZY HORSE FOUGHT ON  UNTIL THE SPRING OF 1877.
 THEN, HIS PEOPLE WEAKENED  BY WAR AND HUNGER,  HE SURRENDERED  AT CAMP ROBINSON, NEBRASKA.
 ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1877,  HE WAS ARRESTED AND BROUGHT  INTO THE GUARD HOUSE.
 REALIZING HE WAS  ABOUT TO BE LOCKED UP,  CRAZY HORSE STRUGGLED  AND WAS STABBED  BY A SOLDIER  WITH A BAYONET.
 HE DIED LATE THAT NIGHT,  AND SOON AFTER,  HIS BODY WAS RETURNED  TO HIS ELDERLY PARENTS.
 TO THIS DAY, HIS FINAL  BURIAL PLACE IS UNKNOWN,  BUT HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON  IN THE BLACK HILLS.
REPATRIATION RAISES COMPLEX ISSUES ABOUT CULTURAL HERITAGE AND WHO OWNS IT.
TODAY, LITERALLY MILLIONS OF AMERICAN INDIAN ARTIFACTS ARE HOUSED IN NON-NATIVE MUSEUMS AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS.
MANY OF THESE OBJECTS, LIKE TOOLS, WEAPONS, AND CLOTHES, WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH PERFECTLY LEGAL MEANS.
OTHERS, HOWEVER, WERE BOUGHT FOR PENNIES OR STOLEN.
THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT SAW NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS, SINCE ITS OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE TRIBES WAS TO TRY TO ASSIMILATE THEM INTO THE MAINSTREAM.
BUT NATIVE PEOPLES ARE STILL WITH US, AND SOME HAVE BEGUN TO ASK FOR -
EVEN DEMAND -
THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ARTIFACTS BACK.
SO IN 1990, THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVE PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT, OR NAGPRA.
NAGPRA REQUIRES FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS TO RETURN SKELETONS AND OBJECTS OF CULTURAL PATRIMONY TO TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES IF THEY FOLLOW THE CORRECT PROCEDURES.
NAGPRA ONLY APPLIES TO FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS.
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS OR MUSEUMS ABROAD DON'T FALL UNDER ITS JURISDICTION.
DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, BOTH THE TRIBES AND MUSEUMS SEE NAGPRA AS A STEP FORWARD.
Wes:  IN AN ENCORE PRESENTATION,  OUR FINAL STORY TURNS THE PAGES  OF A LONG-LOST DIARY  FROM A WORLD WAR II  BOMBER PILOT.
 DECEMBER 13, 1943:  THE U.S.
ARMY AIR FORCE  445th BOMB GROUP  ATTACKS ENEMY SHIPYARDS  BENEATH THE SKIES  OF KIEL, GERMANY.
 IT'S THEIR FIRST  OF 280 AIR-RAID MISSIONS  INSIDE A NEW BOMBER  CALLED THE B-24 LIBERATOR.
 THE BOMBER IS  THE ALLIES' GREAT HOPE,  FLYING FARTHER, LONGER,  AND CARRYING MORE BOMBS  DEEP INTO HITLER'S  GERMANY.
 NOT A SINGLE PLANE IS LOST  ON THIS MISSION,  BUT THE 445th WILL RARELY  BE SO LUCKY AGAIN.
 THE LIBERATOR EARNS ITSELF  ANOTHER MORE OMINOUS NICKNAME:  THE FLYING COFFIN,  DUE TO THE HIGH CASUALTY RATE  AMONG B-24 PILOTS.
 WHY WERE THESE MISSIONS  SO DEADLY,  AND WHAT CONVINCED THEIR CREW  TO ACCEPT SUCH TERRIBLE ODDS?  SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE LAST  OF THOSE MISSIONS,  JIM CHAPMAN  OF LEXINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA,  HAS A DIARY THAT MAY REVEAL  NEW INFORMATION  ABOUT THESE PLANES AND MEN  WHO HELD HITLER AT BAY.
 I'M WES COWAN,  AND I'M HEADING TO MEET JIM.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DIARY.
MY DAD BROUGHT THIS HOME WITH HIM AFTER HE FINISHED HIS TOUR OF DUTY DURING WORLD WAR II.
AND THE OBVIOUS QUESTION TO ME IS, IT'S NOT YOUR DAD'S DIARY.
THAT'S CORRECT.
THE DIARY BELONGED TO HIS CO-PILOT NAMED WILLIAM MORAN.
BOTH SERVED ON A B-24.
 BOTH MEN FLEW PLANES  IN THE 445th BOMB GROUP  STATIONED IN  TIBENHAM, ENGLAND.
HOW DID YOUR DAD GET IT? WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I ACTUALLY DISCOVERED THE DIARY IN A BOX OF MY FATHER'S MEMENTOS.
 HE DISCOVERED IT AFTER  HIS FATHER DIED 20 YEARS AGO.
CAN YOU READ ME SOME ENTRIES? YES, I'D BE GLAD TO.
SURE DREADED GOING, ESPECIALLY AFTER I FOUND THE TARGET TO BE HAMBURG.
FELT SURE I WOULDN'T GET BACK.
AT LEAST I KNOW NOW THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO FACE DEATH WHEN MY TIME COMES.
THE ONLY THING THAT I FEARED WAS LEAVING JAYNE.
I ADORE HER EVERY BREATH.
 MARY JAYNE  WAS MORAN'S WIFE.
 IT'S THESE PERSONAL DETAILS  IN THE DIARY THAT HAUNT JIM.
MAY 9, 1944.
AN AIRMAIL LETTER FROM MY ANGEL.
MY BABY IS PRETTY SURE SHE IS PREGNANT.
THANK GOD! BOUGHT THE BOYS BEER WITH MY LAST SIX SHILLINGS TO CELEBRATE.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.
 THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT  MISSING FROM THIS DIARY:  AN ENDING.
 THE LAST ENTRY IS  FROM OCTOBER 29th,  SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THE END  OF THE WAR IN EUROPE.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WELL, WES, I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO BILL MORAN, IF HE CAME BACK HOME OR IF HE WAS KILLED.
I'D LIKE TO REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.
 JIM IS EAGER  TO KNOW MORE ABOUT  WHAT THE MEN HIS FATHER FLEW  WITH SAW AND DID  DURING THEIR TIME  IN ENGLAND.
 AND HE WANTS HELP  WITH ANOTHER QUESTION, TOO.
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REUNITE THE DIARY WITH BILL MORAN'S FAMILY.
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILY TO HAVE THIS.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE DIARY WITH ME, AND I'M READY TO GET GOING.
WELL, LET'S SEE.
EVERY TIME I READ ONE OF THESE SOLDIER'S DIARIES, I JUST GET THE SENSE THAT I'M HOLDING A PIECE OF HISTORY IN MY HAND.
 THE DIARY COVERS  ABOUT A YEAR,  FROM OCTOBER 1943  TO OCTOBER 1944.
 MUCH OF IT  IS WRITTEN MECHANICALLY,  MORE LIKE A LOG  THAN A PERSONAL JOURNAL.
 BUT IT'S CLEAR HIS UNIT IS  IN THE THICK OF THE ACTION.
HERE'S ONE, SEPTEMBER 27th.
STARTED A LETTER TO MY ANGEL, BUT BAHN STOPPED IN TO TELL ME OUR SQUAD LOST FOUR OUT OF NINE.
IT WAS WITHEY'S LAST ONE.
 A LOT OF BOMBERS WENT DOWN  WITH MEN MORAN KNEW.
 IF HE'S SHAKEN BY THIS,  I WOULDN'T KNOW IT  FROM THE MATTER-OF-FACT  LANGUAGE.
 AND HERE'S BILL MORAN'S  LAST ENTRY,  OCTOBER 29, 1944.
 MORE DEATH AND MORE  MATTER-OF-FACT LANGUAGE.
BILL WRITES, MASS AND COMMUNION.
PUT A COUPLE HOURS ON A SHIP.
HEARD A ROTTEN GERMAN BROADCAST LATE LAST NIGHT CALLING EISENHOWER A RAT.
 BUT THERE ARE NO CLUES  WHY MORAN STOPPED WRITING.
 DID HE GO BACK HOME OR WAS  HIS NEXT MISSION FATAL?  THERE ARE PLENTY  OF NAMES HERE.
 MAYBE SOMEONE BILL MORAN  WROTE ABOUT IS STILL ALIVE  AND CAN FILL IN  THESE BLANK PAGES FOR ME.
LENNY, IT LOOKS LIKE.
GOLDEN.
CHAPPY, PELTON, AND I WERE LUCKY NOT TO GO.
 I'LL CALL MY OFFICE AND ASK  THEM TO TRY TO TRACK DOWN  SOME OF BILL MORAN'S  WAR BUDDIES.
WES COWAN.
BILL OLDSON.
GLAD TO MEET YOU, WES.
 WHILE THEY'RE SEARCHING,  I'VE COME TO FLORIDA  TO MEET WITH PROFESSOR  WILLIAM OLDSON  FROM THE INSTITUTE  ON WORLD WAR II  AND THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE.
HERE'S THE DIARY THAT I SENT YOU THE TRANSCRIPT OF.
OH, NICE.
VERY UNUSUAL COVER.
AND IF I MUST SAY, HIS HANDWRITING'S BETTER THAN MOST, TOO.
 WILLIAM SAYS UNEARTHING  JOURNALS FROM THE BATTLEFRONT  IS ALWAYS  AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY,  A UNIQUE WINDOW ON THE MEN  WHO ACTUALLY DID THE FIGHTING.
IT'S THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH, AND IT'S THE YARDSTICK YOU CAN HOLD UP TO EVERYTHING ELSE -
TO THE LETTERS HOME, TO THE PROPAGANDA, TO THE NEWSREEL -
AND SAY, HERE'S WHAT HE FELT.
 AND THERE CERTAINLY WAS  A LOT TO WRITE ABOUT.
 WILLIAM EXPLAINS THAT  IN 1943,  ALLIED BOMBING RAIDS ON GERMANY  ARE OFTEN INEFFECTUAL  AT HITTING MILITARY  AND INDUSTRIAL TARGETS.
 BUT BY 1944, WITH FORD CRANKING  OUT A NEW B-24 EVERY HOUR,  THE AMERICAN BOMBERS  ARE SUCCESSFULLY TARGETING  HITLER'S FACTORIES  AND FUEL SUPPLIES  AND HELPING TURN THE WAR  IN THE ALLIES' FAVOR.
 BUT THE CARNAGE AMONG  FLIGHT CREWS IS HORRENDOUS.
IN '43, WE LOST OVER 3,000 PLANES.
'44, WE LOSE OVER 11,000 PLANES.
 WILLIAM BELIEVES  THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE  MORAN WAS KILLED  OVER GERMANY.
 FLYING DAYLIGHT RAIDS  MADE THE BOMBERS EASY PREY  FOR GERMAN FIGHTER PLANES  AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS.
IF YOU WERE FLYING WITH BRITISH BOMBER COMMAND, YOU HAD A 65% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY.
IF YOU'RE FLYING IN THE AMERICAN 8th AIR FORCE, YOU'VE GOT A 40% TO 60% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY.
IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE IN THAT KAMIKAZE SQUADRON, YOU'VE ONLY GOT A 53% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
 WHILE LOGISTICS PROBLEMS  OFTEN KEPT JAPANESE KAMIKAZE  SQUADRONS GROUNDED,  IN EUROPE,  THE BIG ALLIED BOMBERS  WERE SEEING COMBAT  ALMOST DAILY.
SO A KAMIKAZE PILOT WHO'S SUPPOSED TO KILL HIMSELF STOOD A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVING THAN A B-24 BOMBER PILOT? HARD TO BELIEVE, ISN'T IT?  WILLIAM SAYS THE OFTEN REMOTE,  MATTER-OF-FACT LANGUAGE  IN SUCH WARTIME WRITING  WAS A WAY OF WALLING OFF  OR ESCAPING  THE HORROR  OF EVERYDAY LIFE.
I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY TYPICAL, IT'S NECESSARY.
THEY CAN'T BROOD ABOUT IT.
IT'S GOING TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE, IT'S GOING TO DEPRESS THEM.
 THE WRITING IS A FORM  OF SELF-DEFENSE.
WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT THE DIARY YOU HAVE IS THE ROMANTIC ASPECT OF IT.
I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER DIARY THAT I'VE SEEN WHERE SOMEBODY'S REFERRING TO HIS WIFE AS ANGEL.
AND WE HAVE LOTS OF LETTERS WHERE IT SAYS, HELLO, HONEY, OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT, BUT NOT IN THE DIARIES.
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR SHARING THIS WITH ME.
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SEE THIS.
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DOCUMENT.
 I STILL DON'T KNOW  EXACTLY WHY  BILL MORAN STOPPED WRITING  IN THE JOURNAL,  BUT MY OFFICE  HAS BEEN ABLE  TO TRACK DOWN  HIS MILITARY RECORDS,  AND THEY'VE SENT THEM  TO ME AT THE LIBRARY.
 IT'S SOBERING NEWS.
 ON OCTOBER 31, 1944,  BILL MORAN WAS FLYING  WITH PILOT EDWARD SPEERS  AND SIX OTHER MEN  WHEN THEIR PLANE DISAPPEARED.
THIS REPORT OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT OR MISSING AIRCRAFT REPORT CONFIRMS THAT MORAN WAS KILLED IN SOME SORT OF A TRAINING ACCIDENT.
THEY'RE NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
HE TOOK OFF IN THE FORMATION.
AFTER HE TOOK OFF, NOBODY ELSE IN THE AIRCRAFT FORMATION EVER SAW HIM AGAIN.
 THE WRECKAGE AND MORAN'S BODY  ARE NEVER FOUND.
THIS TOOK PLACE TWO DAYS AFTER THE LAST ENTRY IN HIS DIARY.
 MARY JAYNE WAS SEVEN MONTHS  PREGNANT WHEN BILL DIED.
 IF I'M GOING TO HELP JIM RETURN  THE JOURNAL TO BILL'S FAMILY,  I'M GOING TO NEED HELP  TRACKING DOWN HIS DESCENDANTS.
 MY OFFICE HAS LOCATED  JACK PELTON,  ONE OF MORAN'S BUDDIES  MENTIONED IN THE DIARY.
HEY, JACK.
HEY, WES.
 JACK AGREES TO MEET ME  AT THE AMERICAN AERO SERVICES  HANGAR IN FLORIDA,  WHERE THE COLLINGS FOUNDATION  MAINTAINS A B-24 BOMBER.
BOY, THIS IS QUITE A PIECE OF MACHINERY, ISN'T IT? OH, IT REALLY IS, IT'S A WONDERFUL AIRPLANE.
AND YOU WERE A PILOT OF ONE OF THESE BIRDS.
I WAS A PILOT, FLEW 32 MISSIONS.
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO GET UP IN THE COCKPIT? LOVE TO.
OH, WONDERFUL.
 IT'S BEEN MORE THAN 50 YEARS  SINCE JACK'S TAKEN A SEAT  AT THE CONTROLS.
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO FLY ONE OF THESE BABIES? IT WAS VERY EXCITING, REALLY.
 JACK TELLS ME  IN ORDER TO ATTACK  HEAVILY DEFENDED TARGETS,  PILOTS LIKE HE  AND BILL MORAN FLEW  AT ALTITUDES  OVER 20,000 FEET,  WHERE TEMPERATURES REACHED  MINUS 30 DEGREES.
SO IT WAS COLD, YOU'RE WEARING AN OXYGEN MASK.
THERE ARE NO HYDRAULICS IN THESE STEERING WHEELS.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HELL OF A JOB.
IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING.
YOU WERE IN ANOTHER WORLD.
 JACK EXPLAINS THAT  THE LIGHTWEIGHT FRAME  THAT MADE THE B-24  SUCH AN EFFICIENT BOMBER  ALSO MADE IT VULNERABLE  TO ENEMY FIRE.
WE BROUGHT ONE PLANE HOME WITH 153 HOLES IN IT.
[ machine gun firing ]  BULLETS AND SHELLS  FROM GERMAN FIGHTER PLANES  TORE THROUGH  THE AMERICAN AIRCRAFT  AND HELPED EARN THE B-24  ITS REPUTATION  AS A FLYING COFFIN.
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT BILL MORAN'S DIARY HERE.
WHAT KIND OF A GUY WAS BILL MORAN? WHAT WAS HE LIKE? BILL MORAN WAS A GREAT CO-PILOT, GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, IRISHMAN ALL THE WAY.
 JACK HAS A PICTURE  OF BILL AND MARY JAYNE,  BILL'S PREGNANT WIFE,  TAKEN RIGHT BEFORE  THE AIRMAN LEFT THE STATES.
SO THAT'S BILL.
BILL.
THAT'S MARY JAYNE.
AND LOOK AT THEM HOLDING HANDS THERE.
I'D RECOGNIZE YOU ANYWHERE.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE HAVING A LOT OF FUN.
YEAH, WE DID, HAD A GREAT EVENING.
LAST TIME WE SAW OUR WIVES FOR A YEAR.
ONE MORE QUESTION: WHERE WAS BILL MORAN FROM? PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.
MARY JAYNE WAS FROM THERE, TOO, THEN? YES, SHE WAS.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO MARY JAYNE, DO YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW.
I TRIED TO FIND HER WHEN I GOT BACK IN THE STATES, COULD NOT.
ONE TIME WHEN I WAS ON BUSINESS IN PITTSBURGH, I HEARD SHE WAS THERE, BUT I STILL COULDN'T TRACK HER DOWN.
 SO I'M BACK  AT THE LIBRARY  TO SEARCH THROUGH  GENEALOGICAL RECORDS.
 AT FIRST, I DRAW A BLANK  LOOKING FOR MARY JAYNE.
 MAYBE I CAN GET INFORMATION  FROM ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER.
 I FINALLY GET A BREAK  WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY  DEATH INDEX  FOR BILL'S MOTHER VERONICA.
BINGO, HERE SHE IS.
SHE DIED IN MARCH 1967 IN MIAMI, FLORIDA.
 HER OBITUARY  EVENTUALLY LEADS US  TO THE NAMES OF TWO  OF BILL'S SURVIVING SISTERS:  ADELAIDE YOUNG  AND JEANIE KIMBROW  OF SEBRING, FLORIDA.
 IF THERE'S A LOCAL LISTING,  MAYBE WE'RE IN BUSINESS.
 IT TAKES A WHILE,  BUT EVENTUALLY I GET LUCKY.
ADELAIDE YOUNG, THERE'S HER PHONE NUMBER, ADDRESS, BORN AUGUST 1930.
IT'S GOT TO BE HER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE FOUND A LIVING RELATIVE.
HELLO, MRS.
YOUNG?  ADELAIDE IS EXCITED  BY NEWS OF THE DIARY,  AND WE MAKE PLANS  TO MEET.
YOU KNOW WHY I'VE COME TO SEE YOU.
YES.
I HAVE A DIARY THAT WAS WRITTEN BY YOUR BROTHER.
OH, MY LIFE IN THE SERVICE.
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT HANDWRITING? OH, OF COURSE.
 IT'S THE CONSTANT REFERENCES  TO BILL'S WIFE  THAT CATCH ADELAIDE'S EYE.
HE ALWAYS SPEAKS OF HER IN SUCH A GENTLE WAY.
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY WERE REALLY IN LOVE.
OH, FROM THE TIME THEY MET.
 ADELAIDE WAS 14  WHEN HER BROTHER DIED.
THE TELEGRAM WAS LAYING ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE, AND WE KEPT SAYING, THEY'LL FIND HIM, THEY'LL FIND HIM.
SOMEDAY THEY'LL FIND HIM.
THERE WAS NEVER ANY MEMORIAL SERVICE OR ANYTHING BECAUSE SOMEDAY THEY'LL FIND HIM.
 AT FIRST THE VERY PREGNANT  MARY JAYNE  WASN'T EVEN TOLD  HER HUSBAND WAS MISSING.
 SHE LEARNED BILL  HAD BEEN KILLED  FROM A FRIEND  WHO VISITED HER  RIGHT AFTER SHE'D GIVEN BIRTH  TO THEIR DAUGHTER.
SHE WAS INCONSOLABLE.
SHE WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLY IN GRIEF.
 MARY JAYNE DIED ROUGHLY  20 YEARS AFTER HER HUSBAND,  BUT WHAT ADELAIDE  REVEALED NEXT  WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY NEWS  FOR JIM.
THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE STORY FOR ME.
 I TELL JIM ABOUT SOME OF  THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED  WHILE WORKING  ON BILL'S DIARY.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THOUGH, THAT I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
 I LET JIM KNOW THAT BILL MORAN  DIED IN A TRAINING MISSION  AND HIS WIFE PASSED AWAY  OVER 40 YEARS AGO,  BUT THE STORY  DOESN'T END THERE.
THERE'S SOMEONE I DO WANT YOU TO MEET, SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME, WE'LL GO MEET THAT PERSON.
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT.
 ADELAIDE TOLD ME  THAT THE BABY  THAT BILL WAS  SO EAGERLY EXPECTING  WAS BORN 32 DAYS  AFTER HE DIED.
 HER NAME WAS JANIE.
SHE'S MARRIED.
SHE HAS TWO CHILDREN AND FOUR GRANDCHILDREN.
 BILL MORAN WOULD HAVE BEEN  A GREAT-GRANDFATHER.
HEY, GUYS.
HI.
I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEBODY, JIM.
THIS IS JIM CHAPMAN.
THIS IS CHAPPY'S SON.
HI, HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS ADELAIDE YOUNG.
THIS IS BILL'S SISTER.
I REMEMBER HIM TALKING ABOUT -
OH, HI, ADELAIDE.
HE TALKED ABOUT BILL CHAPMAN ALL THE TIME.
OH, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
OH, I'M SO GLAD TO MEET YOU.
AND THIS IS BILL'S DAUGHTER, JANIE.
HI, JIM, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF THE JOURNAL.
I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE FOUND YOU.
 THANKS TO JIM,  BILL MORAN'S THOUGHTS  ARE NOW FINALLY GOING HOME  TO THE DAUGHTER  HE NEVER KNEW.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT YOU ALREADY.
[ clears throat ] EXCUSE ME.
SORRY.
THE DIARY'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY FOR 63 YEARS.
WHAT WAS SO FASCINATING WAS READING IN THE DIARY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER CARRYING YOU AND YOUR DAD BEING SO HAPPY AND EXCITED ABOUT YOUR MOM BEING PREGNANT.
IN THE DIARY ITSELF, IT JUST COMES THROUGH THAT HE LOVES YOUR MOTHER VERY MUCH.
 MORAN AND HIS FELLOW PILOTS  HAD HELPED DEAL HITLER'S  WAR MACHINE A CRIPPLING BLOW,  AND THEIR CHILDREN  AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN  WOULD LIVE IN A WORLD  THEY HAD TRANSFORMED.
THIS IS A GLIMPSE INTO YOUR FATHER'S LIFE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JIM, FOR TREASURING IT AND TAKING CARE OF IT FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.
TO HEAR MORE ABOUT JACK PELTON'S EXPERIENCES AS A WORLD WAR II BOMBER PILOT, VISIT HISTORY DETECTIVES ON THE WEB AT pbs.org.
Tukufu: BILL MORAN ALSO WROTE IN HIS DIARY ABOUT THE KASSEL MISSION.
IT'S THE BIGGEST SINGLE LOSS FOR AN AMERICAN BOMBER GROUP IN THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY HISTORY.
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1944.
BAHN STOPPED IN TO TELL ME THAT WE LOST 22 OUT OF 35 SHIPS.
WITHEY, GOLDEN, BOECHER, ROBINSON, AND REYNOLDS DIDN'T GET BACK.
JACK PELTON REMEMBERS THAT DAY WELL.
THEY CALLED ME FOR THAT MISSION AND I HAD A PASS TO GO TO LONDON.
AND I SHOWED THE SERGEANT MY PASS, AND HE SAID, OKAY, TOOK THE GUY IN THE NEXT BUNK, AND HE NEVER CAME HOME.
THIRTY-NINE PLANES FROM THE 445th BOMB GROUP SET OUT TO ATTACK A TANK FACTORY IN KASSEL, GERMANY.
BUT THE LEAD PLANE MAKES A WRONG TURN, AND THE 445th GETS SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE COMBAT WING.
ALONE OVER ENEMY TERRITORY, THE LIBERATORS ARE AMBUSHED BY OVER 100 GERMAN FIGHTERS.
IN LESS THAN FOUR MINUTES, 116 AMERICAN PILOTS ARE DEAD.
SURVIVORS RETURNING TO BASE RECOUNT THE HORROR.
THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH BOMBERS BLOWING UP AND FALLING BOMBER PARTS, PARACHUTES, AND BODIES, AND BODY PARTS.
IT WAS A REAL HOLOCAUST.
SOME OF THE GUYS CAME BACK, THEY WERE ALMOST HYSTERICAL.
THEY COULD HARDLY CONTAIN THEMSELVES.
THOUGH THE LOSS IS TRAGIC, THE WAR GOES ON.
THE NEXT DAY, THE MILITARY SENDS ANOTHER BOMBER GROUP BACK TO KASSEL TO FINISH THE JOB.
ALL OF THOSE PLANES RETURNED SAFELY.
