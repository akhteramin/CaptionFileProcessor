This is your number-one enemy, your favorite playmate... <i> THEY CALL HER</i> <i> TOKYO ROSE.</i> <i> MANY G.I.s CONSIDERED HER</i> <i> A GODSEND,</i> <i> A FAMILIAR AMERICAN VOICE</i> <i> KEEPING THEM COMPANY</i> <i> FAR FROM HOME.</i> <i> BUT IN A CELEBRATED</i> <i> POSTWAR TRIAL,</i> <i> PROSECUTORS PORTRAYED HER</i> <i> AS AN AMERICAN DEVIL,</i> <i> A SIREN WHO KNOWINGLY WORKED</i> <i> FOR THE ENEMY,</i> <i> LURING SOLDIERS AND SAILORS,</i> <i> THEN UNDERMINING</i> <i> THEIR FIGHTING SPIRIT.</i> <i> IN 1948, THE WOMAN</i> <i> WHO TWICE SIGNED HER NAME</i> <i> THE ONE AND ORIGINAL</i> <i> TOKYO ROSE</i> <i> WAS BROUGHT BACK FROM JAPAN</i> <i> TO FACE A GRAND JURY.</i> <i> THE WAR HAD ENDED,</i> <i> BUT HER BATTLE HAD JUST BEGUN.</i> <i> NOW BILL MOORE</i> <i> FROM SUN CITY WEST, ARIZONA,</i> <i> HAS AN OBJECT THAT MAY EXPLAIN</i> <i> THE STORY BEHIND</i> <i> HER CONFESSION.</i> MY UNCLE WENT TO JAPAN TO GET TOKYO ROSE. HI, YOU'RE BILL? SO I HEAR YOU HAVE A RECORD TO SHOW ME. IS THIS IT? YES, THIS IS IT. WOW, IT'S UNUSUAL. THIS MUST BE 16 INCHES ACROSS. SIXTEEN INCHES, I THINK. <i> SOMEONE'S WRITTEN TOKYO ROSE</i> <i> ON THE RECORD.</i> <i> BILL FOUND IT WITH HIS MOTHER'S</i> <i> THINGS AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY,</i> <i> BUT HE BELIEVES</i> <i> IT ORIGINALLY BELONGED</i> <i> TO HIS LARGER-THAN-LIFE UNCLE,</i> <i> HARRY BRUNDIDGE.</i> THIS IS MY UNCLE HARRY AND MY AUNT JANET. WHAT DID HE DO? WELL, HE WAS A WAR CORRESPONDENT AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF<i> COSMOPOLITAN</i> MAGAZINE. THIS IS YOU, IS THAT RIGHT? OH, YEAH. SO WERE YOU OUT IN THE PACIFIC? TWO YEARS, AND WE USED TO LISTEN TO TOKYO ROSE ALL THE TIME. <i> BILL HAD HEARD THAT HIS UNCLE</i> <i> MET TOKYO ROSE ON ASSIGNMENT</i> <i> AND BELIEVES HE PLAYED</i> <i> A KEY ROLE IN HER PROSECUTION.</i> AFTER THE WAR, HE WENT BACK OVER TO JAPAN AND HE GOT TOKYO ROSE, BROUGHT HER BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO, AND HAD HER INDICTED FOR TREASON. <i> BILL THINKS THE RECORD</i> <i> MAY HAVE BEEN USED</i> <i> AS EVIDENCE</i> <i> IN HER TRIAL,</i> <i> BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN ABLE</i> <i> TO HEAR WHAT'S ON THE RECORDING</i> <i> BECAUSE IT'S TOO LARGE</i> <i> TO PLAY ON STANDARD EQUIPMENT.</i> ALL I KNOW IS THAT -
- OF COURSE, WHAT I HEARD FROM MY FAMILY, THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE TRIAL. WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU LIKE FOR ME TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR RECORD? I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S ON IT, OF COURSE, AND ABOUT MY UNCLE IN THE TRIAL. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THIS WITH ME, AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS, TOO, IF THAT'S OKAY. OH, YOU CAN, YEAH. <i> I FOUND A STUDIO</i> <i> WITH A TURNTABLE</i> <i> THAT CAN PLAY</i> <i> THE OVERSIZED DISC.</i> <i> I'M IN LONG ISLAND CITY,</i> <i> NEW YORK,</i> <i> TO MEET AUDIO ENGINEER</i> <i> GUY ROSMARIN AT VIDIPAX.</i> OOH, WOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE IN A WHILE. WHAT IS IT MADE OF? PROBABLY ALUMINUM-BASED. THEY STARTED USING IT AGAIN AFTER THE WAR. YOU COULDN'T USE ALUMINUM DURING THE WAR FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT WAR. THAT'S RIGHT. Female Voice: All right, take it now from five. Tokyo Rose will touch American soil in a few moments and will immediately be taken into custody. <i> WELL, THIS CERTAINLY DOESN'T</i> <i> SOUND LIKE COURTROOM EVIDENCE,</i> <i> BUT BILL'S UNCLE IS DEFINITELY</i> <i> PART OF THE ACTION.</i> We're fortunate today in having two very famous correspondents. Harry Brundidge... <i> GUY HAS MADE A CD COPY FOR ME.</i> <i> BILL'S UNCLE HARRY</i> <i> IS SPEAKING NOW.</i> She just shook hands with me as she came off the boat and recognized me. Female Voice: I noticed that. <i> IVA TOGURI, THE WOMAN</i> <i> WHO WAS TRIED AS TOKYO ROSE,</i> <i> WAS BORN IN LOS ANGELES</i> <i> TO FIRST-GENERATION</i> <i> JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS.</i> <i> SHE LEFT THE U.S.</i> <i> IN THE SUMMER OF '41</i> <i> TO CARE FOR A SICK AUNT</i> <i> IN TOKYO.</i> <i> AFTER PEARL HARBOR,</i> <i> WARTIME BUREAUCRACY</i> <i> MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER</i> <i> TO RETURN TO THE U.S.</i> <i> STRANDED IN JAPAN</i> <i> DURING THE WAR,</i> <i> IVA FOUND A JOB</i> <i> AT RADIO TOKYO AS A TYPIST</i> <i> UNTIL SHE WAS TAPPED</i> <i> TO HOST</i> <i> A JAPANESE WAR</i> <i> PROPAGANDA PROGRAM.</i> <i> IVA'S BROADCASTS WOULD BE</i> <i> AT THE CENTER OF WHAT WAS THEN</i> <i> ONE OF THE COSTLIEST TRIALS</i> <i> IN U.S. HISTORY.</i> THAT TRIAL COST THE U.S. GOVERNMENT $750,000. IN TODAY'S MONEY THAT'S ALMOST $7 MILLION. <i> OF THE EIGHT COUNTS</i> <i> BROUGHT AGAINST HER,</i> <i> THE GRAND JURY FOUND HER GUILTY</i> <i> OF ONLY ONE,</i> <i> ANNOUNCING THE LOSS</i> <i> OF AMERICAN SHIPS.</i> <i> I'M IN NEW YORK CITY,</i> <i> MEETING WITH MEDIA HISTORIAN</i> <i> STEVEN PHIPPS.</i> I'M EAGER FOR YOU TO HEAR THIS. Female Voice: There are crowds here that have been standing since 9:00 this morning waiting to see Tokyo Rose, the girl who undermined the morale -
- or tried to -
- of our boys in the Pacific. WELL, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A NEWS REPORT, AND IT'S CLEAR THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEPTEMBER 25, 1948. <i> STEVEN SAYS THAT'S WHEN IVA</i> <i> RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES</i> <i> BY MILITARY ESCORT.</i> <i> THE PRESS AND PUBLIC CLAMORED</i> <i> FOR A CLOSER LOOK</i> <i> AT THE WOMAN THE MEDIA</i> <i> HAD ALREADY BRANDED</i> <i> A WARTIME TRAITOR:</i> <i> TOKYO ROSE.</i> BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS<i> THE</i> TOKYO ROSE. IN FACT, THERE WAS NO ONE PERSON WHO WAS<i> THE</i> TOKYO ROSE. <i> AS BILL TOLD ME EARLIER,</i> <i> THE G.I.s USED THAT NAME</i> <i> FOR ALL THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING</i> <i> FEMALE HOSTS</i> <i> BROADCASTING IN THE PACIFIC.</i> THE JAPANESE FELT THAT USING A WOMAN ANNOUNCER WOULD MAKE THE G.I.s MORE PRONE TO LISTEN AND THAT IT WOULD TEND TO MAKE THEM HOMESICK. <i> WHY DID BRUNDIDGE CLAIM</i> <i> IVA WAS TOKYO ROSE?</i> <i> STEVEN HAS DONE SOME DIGGING</i> <i> ON THE REPORTER'S BACKGROUND.</i> I FOUND QUITE A FEW ARTICLES ON BRUNDIDGE, SINCE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HIM. <i> MUCH OF HIS EARLY CAREER</i> <i> WAS IN ST. LOUIS,</i> <i> REPORTING ON THE MOB.</i> <i> STEVEN DISCOVERED BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> HAD A FLAIR FOR THE DRAMATIC</i> <i> AND OFTEN PLAYED FAST AND LOOSE</i> <i> WITH THE FACTS.</i> HERE'S ONE FROM 1930. THIS ONE IS CALLED CALL BRUNDIDGE STORY HEARSAY. SO FOR YEARS HE'D BEEN KNOWN AS SOMEONE WHO WAS PUSHING THE TRUTH ON HIS STORIES. WELL, YES. <i> WHAT WAS HIS INVOLVEMENT</i> <i> IN THE TOKYO ROSE STORY?</i> LET ME SHOW YOU IN THIS ARTICLE. <i> IT'S A MAY 1948</i> <i> FRONT-PAGE STORY</i> <i> FROM</i> THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN. <i> THAT'S FOUR MONTHS BEFORE</i> <i> THE DATE ON OUR RECORDING.</i> <i> IN IT, BRUNDIDGE DETAILS</i> <i> HIS TIME IN JAPAN</i> <i> HUNTING FOR EMPEROR HIROHITO,</i> <i> THEN FOR TOKYO ROSE.</i> <i> IN HIS STORY, BRUNDIDGE TAKES</i> <i> CREDIT FOR HER INDICTMENT.</i> THERE'S A REFERENCE TO SECRET WITNESSES THAT BRUNDIDGE CAME UP WITH. BUT DO WE KNOW WHO THEY WERE? I HAVE NO CLUE. <i> STEVEN GIVES ME THE NAME</i> <i> OF A JOURNALIST</i> <i> WHO REVISITED THIS STORY</i> <i> IN THE 1970s.</i> <i> RON YATES,</i> <i> ONCE THE TOKYO BUREAU CHIEF</i> <i> OF THE</i> CHICAGO TRIBUNE, <i> WROTE A SERIES OF ARTICLES</i> <i> IN 1976</i> <i> ON THE TOKYO ROSE TRIAL.</i> <i> WE'VE AGREED TO MEET</i> <i> AT THE JAPANESE AMERICAN</i> <i> NATIONAL MUSEUM IN LOS ANGELES.</i> WELL, HERE'S THE RECORD I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT, RON. OH, WOW, LOOK AT THAT. I'M INVESTIGATING A MAN NAMED HARRY BRUNDIDGE. THEY MENTION HIM ON THIS RECORDING. DO YOU KNOW WHO HE WAS? OH, YEAH, HARRY BRUNDIDGE IS A VERY INTERESTING CHARACTER. <i> RON EXPLAINS</i> <i> HOW HARRY BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> HAD FIRST BECOME INVOLVED</i> <i> WITH TOKYO ROSE</i> <i> THREE YEARS BEFORE THE TRIAL</i> <i> IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH</i> <i> OF WORLD WAR II.</i> <i> THAT'S WHEN BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> HOOKED UP WITH</i> <i> VETERAN WAR CORRESPONDENT</i> <i> CLARK LEE.</i> <i> THEY HEADED TO JAPAN</i> <i> IN 1945</i> <i> IN PURSUIT OF THE SCOOP</i> <i> OF A LIFETIME.</i> THEY THOUGHT, WE'LL FIND TOKYO ROSE AND THAT'LL BE OUR STORY. THEY SAID, WE WILL PAY HER $2,000 IF SHE'LL COME TO THE IMPERIAL HOTEL TO BE INTERVIEWED. <i> IN WAR-TORN TOKYO, WHERE</i> <i> MOST PEOPLE WERE STARVING,</i> <i> THAT MONEY MIGHT GET HER HOME</i> <i> TO THE UNITED STATES.</i> BUT WHEN SHE WALKED INTO THE ROOM, THIS WAS NOT WHAT THEY WERE EXPECTING. <i> IN HER PIGTAILS</i> <i> AND SADDLE SHOES,</i> <i> IVA NEITHER LOOKED</i> <i> NOR SOUNDED THE PART</i> <i> OF THE MATAHARI OF THE EAST.</i> <i> RON SHOWS ME A REENACTMENT</i> <i> OF A</i> ZERO HOUR<i> BROADCAST</i> <i> THAT IVA LATER AGREED TO DO</i> <i> FOR THE U.S. ARMY IN TOKYO.</i> Greetings, everybody. This is your number-one enemy, your favorite playmate, Orphan Ann, ready again for a vicious assault on your morale. <i> RON EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> ALL THE SCRIPTS</i> <i> WERE WRITTEN</i> <i> BY ALLIED P.O.W.s,</i> <i> WHO ALSO HAD BEEN FORCED</i> <i> TO WORK FOR RADIO TOKYO.</i> <i> THE LANGUAGE WAS INTENDED</i> <i> TO BE TONGUE-IN-CHEEK,</i> <i> THE KIND OF TEASING</i> <i> THAT AMERICANS</i> <i> WOULD EASILY RECOGNIZE.</i> AND THEY'D ALWAYS GO OVER THE SCRIPTS WITH HER AND SAY, HERE'S WHAT WE WANT YOU TO SAY, IVA. AND THEN SHE WOULD SAY THESE THINGS, LIKE HELLO, MY HONORABLE BONEHEADS OF THE PACIFIC. THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE ENEMY, ORPHAN ANN. I'M GOING TO SNEAK UP BEHIND YOU WITH MY NAIL FILE. YOU SEE IN HER FACE THAT SHE KNOWS SHE'S SAYING THINGS THAT WOULD SOUND MEAN TO THE JAPANESE BUT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY AN INSIDE JOKE AMONG ALL THE AMERICANS. RIGHT, THERE'S A REAL FACETIOUSNESS TO IT. <i> WHEN BRUNDIDGE AND LEE</i> <i> INTERVIEWED IVA IN 1945,</i> <i> THAT TEASING TONE NEVER MADE IT</i> <i> INTO THEIR NOTES.</i> <i> THEY HAD OTHER PLANS.</i> THE STORY JUST WASN'T THERE. THIS WAS NOT THE SIREN OF THE PACIFIC. <i> BRUNDIDGE TOOK OUT THE CONTRACT</i> <i> FOR $2,000,</i> <i> THEN ASKED IVA</i> <i> A FATEFUL QUESTION.</i> JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT, WOULD YOU JUST SIGN THIS AS TOKYO ROSE? AND SHE SAID, SURE. WHAT HE DID WAS HE TOOK THOSE NOTES AND GAVE THEM TO THE OCCUPATION FORCES, AUTHORITIES, AND SAID, I HAVE THE SIGNED CONFESSION OF TOKYO ROSE HERE. AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS SHE WAS ARRESTED. <i> SHE WAS FIRST IMPRISONED</i> <i> IN TOKYO UNDER MARTIAL LAW</i> <i> AND HELD FOR A YEAR</i> <i> WHILE THE ARMY</i> <i> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS</i> <i> INVESTIGATED.</i> <i> FINDING NO EVIDENCE</i> <i> OF TREASON,</i> <i> THE WAR DEPARTMENT CLEARED</i> <i> AND FINALLY RELEASED HER.</i> <i> THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN</i> <i> THE END OF IT.</i> SO BRUNDIDGE MET HER IN '45, '46 SHE'S RELEASED FROM PRISON, HOW DID IT BECOME A STORY AGAIN IN 1948? THAT IS A STORY IN ITSELF. <i> AFTER BEING FREED</i> <i> BY THE U.S. ARMY,</i> <i> IVA HAD APPLIED</i> <i> FOR REPATRIATION.</i> <i> BUT THE POPULAR RADIO HOST</i> <i> WALTER WINCHELL</i> <i> LEARNED OF THE REQUEST</i> <i> AND STARTED A CAMPAIGN</i> <i> TO PREVENT HER RETURN</i> <i> AND TRY HER FOR TREASON.</i> GOLD STAR MOTHERS -
- THESE ARE MOTHERS WHO HAD LOST THEIR SONS FIGHTING IN THE PACIFIC -
- BEGAN WRITING TO WALTER WINCHELL, HE FORWARDED THOSE TO THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT PRESSURE BEGAN TO BUILD. <i> IT WAS AN ELECTION YEAR.</i> <i> RON SAYS CHARGES OF BEING SOFT</i> <i> ON COMMUNISTS AND TRAITORS</i> <i> WAS A CRITICAL FACTOR</i> <i> IN TRUMAN'S CLOSE PRESIDENTIAL</i> <i> RACE AGAINST THOMAS DEWEY.</i> THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T WANT TO BE PERCEIVED AS BEING SOFT ON TRAITORS. <i> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</i> <i> ISSUED A REQUEST FOR WITNESSES</i> <i> TO IVA'S ALLEGED ACTS</i> <i> OF TREASON.</i> SO HERE COMES BRUNDIDGE AGAIN. <i> WHEN BRUNDIDGE MET UP WITH</i> <i> ATTORNEY GENERAL TOM CLARK,</i> <i> HE OFFERED TO GET</i> <i> A NEW CONFESSION FROM IVA</i> <i> AND TO FIND WITNESSES</i> <i> TO HELP CONVICT HER.</i> TOM CLARK ASSIGNS SOME OF HIS MINIONS TO GO BACK TO TOKYO, AND HARRY BRUNDIDGE GOES WITH THEM. <i> RON SAYS IT WASN'T UNTIL</i> <i> A QUARTER-CENTURY</i> <i> AFTER IVA'S TRIAL</i> <i> THAT HE UNLOCKED</i> <i> A CRUCIAL PIECE</i> <i> OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY.</i> <i> RON ARRANGED TO MEET TWO MEN</i> <i> WHO HAD HELD ON TO A SECRET:</i> <i> GEORGE MITSUSHIO</i> <i> AND KEN OKI,</i> <i> IVA'S OLD BOSSES</i> <i> FROM RADIO TOKYO.</i> THEY SAID, WE -
- OUR TESTIMONY IS WHAT CONVICTED HER, AND IT WAS ALL A LIE. THEY HAD BEEN COACHED FOR TWO MONTHS BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN WHAT THEY SHOULD SAY AT THE TRIAL. AND THEIR TESTIMONY WAS THE SIXTH OF THE EIGHT COUNTS WHICH SHE WAS INDICTED ON, THAT SHE DID SPEAK INTO A MICROPHONE ABOUT THE LOSS OF SHIPS. <i> BUT WHAT ABOUT</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE'S CLAIMS</i> <i> OF FINDING ADDITIONAL</i> <i> SECRET WITNESSES?</i> I KNOW THE PERFECT PERSON TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM. <i> I'M MEETING WITH BARBARA</i> <i> TREMBLEY AT DARKWOOD STUDIOS.</i> <i> BARBARA MET IVA</i> <i> 20 YEARS AGO.</i> <i> OVER TIME THEY BECAME FRIENDS.</i> <i> IVA AGREED TO TELL</i> <i> HER FULL STORY</i> <i> AND GAVE BARBARA THE RIGHTS</i> <i> TO MAKE HER SAGA</i> <i> INTO A FEATURE FILM.</i> I HAVE A RECORDING THAT IS DESCRIBING THE MOMENT WHEN IVA COMES BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. <i> I TELL BARBARA THAT</i> <i> ON THIS RECORDING</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE BOASTS OF GETTING IVA</i> <i> TO SIGN A NEW CONFESSION.</i> WHY IS IVA EVEN WILLING TO SEE HIM, MUCH LESS TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT? SHE HAD JUST LOST HER BABY. <i> BARBARA EXPLAINS THAT IVA</i> <i> HAD JUST SUFFERED A MISCARRIAGE</i> <i> AND DESPERATELY WANTED</i> <i> TO GET HOME TO THE STATES.</i> <i> IVA TOLD BARBARA THAT</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE HAD ASSURED HER</i> <i> THAT SIGNING THE DOCUMENT</i> <i> WAS A PASSPORT HOME.</i> AND THEN AS SOON AS SHE SIGNED IT, BRUNDIDGE LEANED OVER TO IVA AND HE SAID, YOU'VE DONE YOURSELF A GOOD DEAL. THEY'LL NEVER EXECUTE A WOMAN. SHE LOST HER HEART AT THAT POINT. BRUNDIDGE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT SECRET WITNESSES THAT WOULD PROVE THE CASE AGAINST IVA. YES, MR. YAGI. YAGI WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE THAT BRUNDIDGE HAD KNOWN BEFORE THE WAR. <i> BARBARA SAYS THAT WHEN</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE TRAVELED TO JAPAN,</i> <i> HIROM YAGI ACTED AS A FIXER,</i> <i> MAKING LOCAL INTRODUCTIONS</i> <i> FOR THE JOURNALIST.</i> BRUNDIDGE LITERALLY BRIBED HIM. HE SAID, YOU WILL GET A TRIP TO THE U.S. AND WE'LL HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TESTIFY FOR THE GRAND JURY, AND THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY. <i> BARBARA FOUND</i> <i> THE HANDWRITTEN TESTIMONY</i> <i> YAGI HAD GIVEN BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL.</i> I HEARD HER SAY INTO THE MICROPHONE, 'YOUR WIVES ARE OUT WITH WAR WORKERS.' SO DOES HE TESTIFY AT THE TRIAL BEFORE THE GRAND JURY? YES, HE DOES. BUT AS SOON AS HE GETS BACK TO JAPAN, HE RECANTS. YAGI EVEN WRITES A LETTER TO BRUNDIDGE ASKING HIM TO PLEASE STOP THIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. DEAR MR. BRUNDIDGE, THIS IS AN ELEVENTH HOUR APPEAL ASKING YOU TO USE YOUR GOOD INFLUENCES TO CALL OFF THE COMING TRIAL, IF POSSIBLE. <i> BARBARA EXPLAINS THAT BY NOW</i> <i> THE GOVERNMENT</i> <i> HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS</i> <i> ABOUT BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> AND EVEN BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE</i> <i> HIM FOR WITNESS TAMPERING,</i> <i> BUT THEY HAD TOO MUCH INVESTED</i> <i> IN THE TRIAL TO BACK OUT NOW.</i> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, TOM CLARK, AND SO ON, THEY PUT A LID ON IT AND IT BECAME A COVER-UP. <i> THE TRIAL PROCEEDED</i> <i> AS PLANNED,</i> <i> BUT DID IT GO ON</i> <i> WITH BRUNDIDGE?</i> THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES VERY INTERESTING. <i> THE CONFIDENTIAL FILES</i> <i> OF FBI DIRECTOR J. EDGAR HOOVER</i> <i> WERE OPENED IN 2005.</i> <i> IN THOSE DOCUMENTS</i> <i> BARBARA HAS FOUND</i> <i> SOME ANSWERS FOR BILL.</i> LET ME PLAY FOR YOU WHAT'S ON YOUR RECORD, AND THEN WE HEAR A VOICE YOU MAY RECOGNIZE. Brundidge on recording: I went back at the request of the attorney general last March, and Rose willingly signed it. I RECOGNIZE HIS VOICE. THAT WAS MY UNCLE HARRY. <i> I TELL BILL</i> <i> ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S ROLE</i> <i> IN LINKING</i> <i> THE REAL-LIFE IVA TOGURI</i> <i> AND THE FABLED TOKYO ROSE.</i> THAT'S SAD, ISN'T IT? YEAH. HE PROBABLY DID MOST ANYTHING TO GET A STORY, AND THAT WAS A BIG STORY. YOU'D WANTED TO KNOW WHAT PART HARRY BRUNDIDGE PLAYED IN THIS TRIAL. WHEN HE MENTIONED THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAD SENT HIM BACK, THAT'S WHERE THE STORY BECOMES LARGER THAN JUST YOUR UNCLE. SO WHAT WAS BRUNDIDGE'S ROLE IN THE TRIAL? WELL, BRUNDIDGE HAD NO ROLE IN THE TRIAL. THEY DIDN'T ALLOW HIM TO TESTIFY. THE FBI, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: HE WAS SUCH A HOT POTATO, NOBODY WANTED TO GET NEAR HIM. <i> ON ONE INTERNAL MEMO,</i> <i> BARBARA DISCOVERED</i> <i> THAT J. EDGAR HOOVER</i> <i> HAD WEIGHED IN</i> <i> ON BRUNDIDGE'S</i> <i> SO-CALLED WITNESS</i> <i> RECANTING HIS TESTIMONY.</i> I'M NOT SURPRISED AT DEVELOPMENTS. IT WAS MOST UNWISE FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO USE SUCH A PERSON AS BRUNDIDGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY REALIZED THE WHOLE CASE COULD BE BLOWN UP IF HE TESTIFIED. HE FINALLY WENT TO THE DEFENSE AND OFFERED TO TESTIFY FOR THEM, AND THEY WOULDN'T TOUCH HIM EITHER. GEE, THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW, BACK IN WAR TIMES, PEOPLE LOOKED UPON THE JAPANESE REALLY BAD, AND IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY WERE AMERICANS OR -
- LOOK AT ALL THE INTERNEES THEY HAD, AND THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY WERE. BILL, I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS RECORD AND GIVING ME A CHANCE TO SEE THIS LARGER HISTORY. THANK YOU. THANK<i> YOU.</i> I'M GLAD ALL THIS CAME OUT. I APPRECIATE THE WISDOM WITH WHICH YOU HEARD THE STORY. <i> GIVEN THE NEW PUBLIC</i> <i> DISCLOSURES</i> <i> ABOUT IVA'S INNOCENCE</i> <i> AND THE PERJURED TESTIMONY</i> <i> AGAINST HER,</i> <i> PRESIDENT FORD AGREED</i> <i> TO LOOK INTO HER CASE.</i> <i> IN HIS LAST OFFICIAL ACT</i> <i> IN OFFICE,</i> <i> HE GRANTED IVA TOGURI A FULL</i> <i> AND UNCONDITIONAL PARDON</i> <i> ON JANUARY 19, 1977.</i> <i> SHE PASSED AWAY</i> <i> IN 2006.</i> TWELVE AMERICANS WERE TRIED FOR TREASON AFTER WORLD WAR II. SEVEN WERE RADIO BROADCASTERS. AXIS SALLY WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFAMOUS. BORN MILDRED GILLARS, SHE DREAMT OF BECOMING A STARLET. WITH LITTLE THEATER SUCCESS, GILLARS MOVED TO GERMANY IN THE MID-1930s AND WORKED FOR RADIO BERLIN. FROM DECEMBER 1941 TO MAY 1945, GILLARS' SULTRY VOICE REACHED AMERICAN G.I.s WITH PRO-GERMAN WAR UPDATES DESIGNED TO DEPLETE MORALE. GILLARS' BROADCASTS CAME UNDER THE AUSPICES OF JOSEPH GOEBBELS, HITLER'S PROPAGANDA MINISTER. SHE POSED AS AN AMERICAN RED CROSS VOLUNTEER, INTERVIEWING AMERICAN P.O.W.s BUT DISTORTING THEIR COMMENTS. SHE CRITICIZED ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL AND MUSED ABOUT THE UNFAITHFULNESS OF G.I. WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS BACK HOME. AXIS SALLY'S MOST INFAMOUS BROADCAST, VISION OF INVASION, TARGETED AMERICAN TROOPS AWAITING D-DAY. GILLARS PLAYED A G.I. MOTHER DREAMING OF HER SON'S DEATH. CRIES OF THE WOUNDED PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND, CREATING THE IMPRESSION OF IMPENDING SLAUGHTER. The boys will be killed or crippled for the rest of their lives. AFTER THE WAR, GILLARS WAS EXTRADITED TO THE U.S. SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF TREASON AND SENTENCED TO 10 TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON. IN 1961, GILLARS LEFT JAIL TO LIVE IN A CONVENT AND TEACH CATHOLIC SCHOOL. SHE DIED IN 1988. Elyse: <i> OUR NEXT STORY GOES IN SEARCH</i> <i> OF A NATIVE-AMERICAN LEGEND.</i> <i> MORE THAN 125 YEARS</i> <i> AFTER HIS DEATH,</i> <i> THE NAME CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> STILL ECHOES</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS</i> <i> OF SOUTH DAKOTA.</i> <i> IN LIFE, THE LAKOTA WARRIOR</i> <i> AND SPIRITUAL MAN</i> <i> VOWED TO PROTECT</i> <i> THESE SACRED HUNTING GROUNDS</i> <i> FROM ENCROACHING SETTLERS</i> <i> AND GOLD MINERS.</i> <i> IN 1876, HE HELPED CRUSH</i> <i> THE U.S. CAVALRY TROOPS</i> <i> OF GENERAL GEORGE CUSTER AT THE</i> <i> BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN.</i> <i> BUT IS THIS A TRUE LIKENESS</i> <i> OF THE WARRIOR?</i> <i> DESPITE HIS FAME, CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> REFUSED TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED,</i> <i> SHUNNING WHITES</i> <i> AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES.</i> <i> FOR YEARS, RUMORS</i> <i> OF CRAZY HORSE PHOTOGRAPHS</i> <i> HAVE TANTALIZED COLLECTORS.</i> <i> MORE THAN 125 YEARS</i> <i> AFTER THE WARRIOR'S DEATH,</i> <i> TIM GIAGO</i> <i> OF RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA,</i> <i> HAS A FRAMED IMAGE</i> <i> WHICH MAY BE</i> <i> THE ONLY PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE</i> <i> OF THIS LEGEND.</i> IT SAID, TASUNKA WITKO, AND TASUNKA WITKO IS THE LAKOTA NAME THAT MEANS CRAZY HORSE. <i> I'M MEETING TIM AT HIS HOME</i> <i> TO FIND OUT MORE.</i> HI. WELCOME TO MY HOUSE. THANK YOU. WELL, ABOUT 27 YEARS AGO, A CONSTRUCTION MANAGER CAME INTO MY NEWSPAPER,<i> THE LAKOTA TIMES,</i> AND HE HAD THIS WITH HIM. ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES, A LAKOTA MAN, HAD PUT IT IN HOCK AND SAID HE COULD HAVE IT IF HE WENT DOWN AND TOOK IT OUT OF PAWN. SO HE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO MY NEWSPAPER. ALONG WITH THAT WAS THIS LETTER WHICH IS DATED 1904. IT'S WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN THE VERY OLD LAKOTA LANGUAGE. IT SAYS THAT TASUNKA WITKO, WHICH MEANS CRAZY HORSE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CRAZY HORSE? CRAZY HORSE WAS REALLY ONE OF THE GREAT WARRIORS OF THE LAKOTA. PEOPLE SAID THAT BULLETS COULDN'T HIT HIM. ONE OF THE REASONS HE'S SO ADMIRED AND LOVED BY THE LAKOTA PEOPLE TODAY IS HE WOULD NEVER SIGN A TREATY. HE NEVER SOLD OUT ANY LAND OR ANY OF HIS PEOPLE, AND TO ME THAT'S HIGHLY ADMIRABLE. <i> BUT WHAT CRAZY HORSE LOOKS LIKE</i> <i> HAS LONG BEEN A MYSTERY.</i> DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS OF CRAZY HORSE? I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE. I'VE SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE DISPROVED, THAT THAT'S NOT CRAZY HORSE, ALWAYS PROVED TO BE SOMEONE ELSE. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FIND OUT VERY MUCH WHETHER THIS IS INDEED A TRUE PICTURE OF CRAZY HORSE. <i> IT'S JUST AS TIM SUGGESTED.</i> <i> THERE ARE A NUMBER</i> <i> OF DISPUTED IMAGES</i> <i> CLAIMING TO BE CRAZY HORSE.</i> <i> MOST OF THEM HAVE</i> <i> PRETTY SHAKY STORIES,</i> <i> AND NONE RESEMBLE OUR GUY.</i> <i> THERE'S NOTHING OBVIOUS</i> <i> TO SUGGEST OUR MAN</i> <i> IS EVEN A WARRIOR CHIEF,</i> <i> NO WAR BONNET</i> <i> OR ELABORATE DECORATION.</i> HE DOES HAVE A COLLAR ON AND AN EAGLE FEATHER, BUT BESIDES THAT, HE'S DRESSED PRETTY PLAINLY. <i> I'M TRYING TO TAKE</i> <i> THE BACK OFF CAREFULLY.</i> <i> IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S</i> <i> MORE LAKOTA WRITING</i> <i> ALONG WITH THE DATE, 1875.</i> AH, NOW, THIS IS HELPFUL. <i> HERE AGAIN, CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> AND 1875 IN HANDWRITING.</i> <i> BUT THERE'S ALSO</i> <i> A STAMPED NAME AND ADDRESS.</i> ALEX GARDNER, 921 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, WASHINGTON, D.C. <i> LET ME DO SOME DIGGING.</i> <i> THERE WAS AN ALEXANDER GARDNER</i> <i> WHO WAS A CELEBRATED</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHER</i> <i> IN THE 19th CENTURY.</i> <i> HE PHOTOGRAPHED</i> <i> ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</i> <i> I'M NOT CERTAIN</i> <i> THEY WERE THE SAME PERSON,</i> <i> BUT ALEXANDER GARDNER</i> <i> WAS A SCOTTISH SOCIALIST</i> <i> WHO HAD GOTTEN INTERESTED</i> <i> IN PHOTOGRAPHY</i> <i> AFTER SEEING</i> <i> MATTHEW BRADY'S WORK.</i> <i> BRADY AND GARDNER BECAME</i> <i> THE TWO BEST KNOWN</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHERS OF THE CIVIL WAR.</i> <i> BUT IT SEEMS THAT A NUMBER</i> <i> OF GARDNER'S BATTLEFIELD IMAGES</i> <i> FROM THE WAR</i> <i> WERE CONTROVERSIAL.</i> HE ACTUALLY MOVED BODIES ON THE CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELDS TO BETTER SUIT HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC NEEDS. <i> AND THIS IS INTERESTING:</i> <i> GARDNER TRAVELED TO</i> <i> THE LAKOTA TERRITORIES IN 1868</i> <i> TO PHOTOGRAPH NEGOTIATIONS</i> <i> BETWEEN NORTHERN PLAIN TRIBES</i> <i> AND THE GOVERNMENT.</i> <i> THE FORT LARAMIE TREATY</i> <i> ESTABLISHED</i> <i> THE GREAT SIOUX RESERVATION</i> <i> AND PROTECTED THE BLACK HILLS</i> <i> FOR THE LAKOTA.</i> <i> IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS</i> <i> AN ALEXANDER GARDNER PHOTOGRAPH</i> <i> AND THAT GARDNER MET</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE,</i> <i> BUT THE DATE ON OUR PHOTO,</i> <i> IF IT'S ACCURATE,</i> <i> IS SEVEN YEARS AFTER</i> <i> GARDNER PHOTOGRAPHED</i> <i> THE LAKOTA TREATIES.</i> I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT I NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THIS NOTE SAYS. <i> I'M HEADED TO</i> <i> OGLALA LAKOTA COLLEGE</i> <i> IN RAPID CITY.</i> <i> LAKOTA LANGUAGE AND CULTURE</i> <i> PROFESSOR WILMER MESTETH</i> <i> IS SKEPTICAL OF OUR IMAGE.</i> <i> HE EXPLAINS WHY CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> REJECTED PHOTOGRAPHY.</i> IN ORAL HISTORY THEY SAID HE MADE A STATEMENT THAT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE EVIL AND THAT ANYBODY THAT TOOK THEIR PHOTOGRAPH, THEIR SOUL WAS CAPTURED IN THE PICTURE. <i> CRAZY HORSE'S REJECTION</i> <i> OF THE WHITE MAN'S TECHNOLOGY</i> <i> WAS PART OF HIS DEFENSE OF THE</i> <i> BESIEGED LAKOTA WAY OF LIFE.</i> <i> THE 1868 TREATY</i> <i> OF FORT LARAMIE</i> <i> HAD GUARANTEED THE LAKOTA</i> <i> THEIR TRIBAL LANDS,</i> <i> BUT JUST SIX YEARS LATER,</i> <i> THE TREATY WOULD BE VIOLATED.</i> IN 1874, THERE WAS AN EXPEDITION THAT CAME DOWN INTO THE BLACK HILLS IN SEARCH OF GOLD, LED BY GENERAL CUSTER, AND THEY DID FIND GOLD IN THE BLACK HILLS. <i> TWO YEARS LATER,</i> <i> IN JUNE 1876,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE HELPED DEFEAT</i> <i> GENERAL CUSTER</i> <i> AT THE BATTLE</i> <i> OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN.</i> <i> IT WAS THE WORST U.S. MILITARY</i> <i> DEFEAT OF THE INDIAN WARS.</i> <i> ALTHOUGH MANY</i> <i> SIOUX CONTEMPORARIES</i> <i> WERE PHOTOGRAPHED,</i> <i> THE LAKOTA HAVE RELIED</i> <i> ON ORAL HISTORY</i> <i> FOR A DESCRIPTION</i> <i> OF CRAZY HORSE.</i> THEY SAID HE WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT, HIS HAIR WAS LIGHT IN COLOR, AND HIS COMPLEXION WAS LIGHT. AND HE HAD A MYSTERIOUS AURA ABOUT HIM. THEY SAID YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL HIS PRESENCE AND HIS STRENGTH AS A POWERFUL MAN. THIS IS THE LETTER THAT CAME WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS LETTER IS WRITTEN IN OLD LAKOTA ORTHOGRAPHY, IN LAKOTA LANGUAGE. <i> WILMER TELLS ME THAT OLD LAKOTA</i> <i> WAS USED FOR A HUNED YEARS,</i> <i> UNTIL ABOUT 1960.</i> [ reading in Lakota ] THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE. WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY? [ reading in Lakota ] THE WAY YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS HE IS THERE IS A SCAR ON HIS LEFT CHEEK. IS IT TRUE THAT CRAZY HORSE HAD A SCAR? YES, CRAZY HORSE WAS SHOT BY A MAN CALLED NO WATER IN A JEALOUS RAGE. HE SHOT TO KILL CRAZY HORSE BUT GRAZED HIM ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHEEK. <i> THE MAN ON THE PHOTO</i> <i> IS FAVORING HIS RIGHT.</i> <i> IF THERE'S A SCAR ON THE LEFT,</i> <i> I CAN'T TELL.</i> THEN IT SAYS, WE WERE WITH CRAZY HORSE WAY BACK THEN. THIS IS ME, DEWEY BEARD. <i> WILMER THINKS THAT</i> <i> DEWEY BEARD</i> <i> MAY HAVE DICTATED THE STORY</i> <i> TO SOMEONE,</i> <i> POSSIBLY TO THIS B.B.E.</i> <i> SIGNED AT THE BOTTOM.</i> AND WHO WAS DEWEY BEARD? DEWEY BEARD WAS THERE AT THE LITTLE BIGHORN AT THE AGE OF 10 YEARS OLD. AND POSSIBLY KNEW CRAZY HORSE. I'M PRETTY SURE THIS PERSON KNEW CRAZY HORSE, YES. IN YOUR OPINION, DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COULD BE CRAZY HORSE? I DON'T THINK SO. THIS PERSON IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS OF DARKER COMPLEXION. CRAZY HORSE HIMSELF WAS LIGHT-COMPLECTED. <i> I'M NOT SURE WHAT</i> <i> TO MAKE OF THIS.</i> <i> WILMER THINKS THE NOTE</i> <i> IS LEGITIMATE.</i> <i> STILL, HISTORY'S VERDICT</i> <i> STANDS IN OUR WAY.</i> NOBODY'S EVER PRODUCED A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE, EVER. <i> WILMER SUGGESTED I VISIT</i> <i> THE CRAZY HORSE MEMORIAL</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS.</i> <i> SCULPTOR KORCZAK ZIOLKOWSKI</i> <i> BEGAN THE MASSIVE CARVING</i> <i> IN THE 1940s...</i> <i> AND TODAY IT REMAINS</i> <i> THE WORLD'S LARGEST</i> <i> MOUNTAIN SCULPTURE</i> <i> IN PROGRESS.</i> <i> THE MONUMENT IS A TESTAMENT TO</i> <i> THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS MEMORY,</i> <i> BUT WHERE IS THE PHYSICAL MODEL</i> <i> FOR THE MASSIVE FACE?</i> <i> DOUG WAR EAGLE IS</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE'S GRANDSON.</i> HOW WAS THE MONUMENT BUILT? I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE? IT'S JUST THE CLOSEST REPLICA OF HIM. THERE NEVER WAS A PHOTO EVER TAKEN OF OUR GRANDFATHER. <i> HE SAYS THE MONUMENT REPRESENTS</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE'S SPIRIT</i> <i> RATHER THAN HIS EXACT IMAGE.</i> <i> WHEN I SHOW DOUG OUR PHOTO,</i> <i> RIGHT AWAY HE'S SKEPTICAL.</i> THIS MAN HAS AN EAGLE FEATHER IN HIS HAIR. OUR GRANDFATHER NEVER WORE AN EAGLE FEATHER IN HIS HAIR. OUR GRANDPA WEARS THE RED-TAILED HAWK FEATHER WITH THE BUFFALO BONE. <i> DOUG'S BROUGHT SOMETHING</i> <i> TO SHOW ME</i> <i> THAT FEW OUTSIDE HIS FAMILY</i> <i> HAVE SEEN.</i> I'VE BROUGHT TWO SKETCHES OF OUR GRANDFATHER'S. THE FIRST ONE IS WAGLULA, OLD MAN CRAZY HORSE. <i> HE SAYS THE WARRIOR</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> WAS ACTUALLY THE THIRD MAN</i> <i> TO CARRY THAT NAME.</i> <i> IN ACCORDANCE</i> <i> WITH LAKOTA TRADITION,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE INHERITED THE NAME</i> <i> FROM THIS MAN, HIS FATHER,</i> <i> WHEN HE BECAME A WARRIOR.</i> AND THE OTHER SKETCH I HAVE HERE IS OF THE WARRIOR. <i> IT WAS SKETCHED LONG AFTER</i> <i> HIS DEATH IN 1934,</i> <i> WHEN CRAZY HORSE'S</i> <i> YOUNGER SISTER</i> <i> DESCRIBED HIS APPEARANCE</i> <i> TO A FORENSIC ARTIST.</i> <i> THE LIKENESS TRIGGERED</i> <i> AN EMOTIONAL REACTION.</i> SHE CRIED, BECAUSE SHE SAID THAT'S THE CLOSEST LIKENESS THAT YOU WILL EVER HAVE OF HIM. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WELL, HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE OUR PHOTOGRAPH. SO IT HAS THE TWO FEATHERS, THE LONG, FLOWING HAIR, AND A LITTLE BIT OF A SCAR. THAT'S THE CLOSEST WE'LL EVER GET OF OUR GRANDFATHER, THE WARRIOR, THE ONE THAT FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF LITTLE BIGHORN. <i> DOUG IS CONVINCED OUR IMAGE</i> <i> ISN'T CRAZY HORSE.</i> <i> BUT THIS SKETCH</i> <i> WAS MADE BY SOMEONE</i> <i> WHO NEVER MET CRAZAZY HORSE,</i> <i> SIX DECADES AFTER HE DIED.</i> <i> I'M TAKING THE IMAGE</i> <i> TO THE SMITHSONIAN,</i> <i> WHICH HOUSES</i> <i> THE WORLD'S LARGEST ARCHIVE</i> <i> OF NATIVE-AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS.</i> <i> I WANT TO SHOW IT TO ONE</i> <i> OF THE SMITHSONIAN'S CURATORS.</i> <i> BUT FIRST,</i> <i> BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN</i> <i> MANY BOGUS</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE PICTURES,</i> <i> WHILE I'M HERE,</i> <i> I ALSO WANT TO SHOW IT</i> <i> TO STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER</i> <i> DON HURLBURT.</i> WELCOME TO THE DARKROOM. WOW. OKAY, SO HERE'S MY PIECE, AND ON THE BACK IT SAYS 1875. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS PERIOD. IT DEFINITELY HAS CHARACTERISTICS FROM THAT TIME FRAME. IT'S YELLOWING, IT'S GOT A GOOD GOLD TONE TO IT. IT HAS THE SHININESS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PRINT THAT A MODERN PRINT WOULD NOT HAVE BUT PRINTS OF THAT AGE DO. HOW WOULD A PRINT LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE 1870s? IT WAS DEFINITELY A MULTI-DAY, MULTI-STEP PROCESS TO MAKE ONE OF THESE PRINTS. THESE GUYS DID A LOT OF WORK TO GET THESE PHOTOGRAPHS. THESE PRINTS CAME FROM GLASS PLATE NEGATIVES THAT WERE MADE, PRODUCED FROM ABOUT THE 1850s TO 1880s. WELL, I CAN SHOW YOU. <i> THE INVENTION OF GLASS PLATES</i> <i> MEANT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME,</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHERS LIKE GARDNER</i> <i> HAD A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEDIUM</i> <i> FROM WHICH TO MAKE</i> <i> UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF PRINTS.</i> <i> GLASS PLATES REVOLUTIONIZED</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHY.</i> NOW THAT I'VE CLEANED IT AND CHECKED IT, WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT OVER HERE, SET IT DOWN, GET A SHEET OF MODERN PAPER OUT, BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE ALBUMEN PAPER WITH US ANYMORE. <i> DON SAYS GARDNER, OR WHOEVER</i> <i> TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH,</i> <i> WOULD HAVE MADE</i> <i> ALBUMEN SILVER PRINTS,</i> <i> WHICH EXPOSED</i> <i> IN SUNLIGHT.</i> <i> TODAY, USING MODERN</i> <i> PHOTO PAPER,</i> <i> DEVELOPING A PRINT IN THE</i> <i> DARKROOM TAKES MERE MINUTES.</i> THAT'S GREAT. <i> I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PRINT</i> <i> FROM FORMER ARCHIVIST</i> <i> AND SMITHSONIAN VOLUNTEER</i> <i> PAULA FLEMING.</i> <i> SHE SAYS THE IMAGE WAS ALMOST</i> <i> CERTAINLY TAKEN BY GARDNER</i> <i> NOT OUT WEST</i> <i> BUT ON THE EAST COAST</i> <i> AT THE ADDRESS</i> <i> ON THE BACK OF OUR PHOTOGRAPH.</i> HE HAD A STUDIO IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND HE TOOK MOST OF HIS INDIAN PORTRAITS THERE. WELL, WHAT WOULD BRING THEM TO WASHINGTON, D.C.? AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT RENEWED ITS EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THE INDIANS TO RESOLVE ISSUES OF LAND ACQUISITION AND ANNUITIES. <i> PAULA SAYS HUNDREDS</i> <i> OF AMERICAN INDIANS</i> <i> WERE INVITED TO WASHINGTON</i> <i> AS TRIBAL DELEGATIONS.</i> THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SHOW THE INDIANS THE BENEFITS OF CIVILIZATION, SO THEY TOOK THEM ON TRAINS AND THEY TOOK THEM TO BIG CITIES TO SHOW THEM WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE CIVILIZED. <i> ON THE SURFACE,</i> <i> THE WASHINGTON VISITS</i> <i> WERE EFFORTS TO PEACEFULLY</i> <i> RESOLVE LAND DISPUTES</i> <i> AND DEMONSTRATE</i> <i> THAT THE INDIANS</i> <i> WERE BEING TREATED</i> <i> RESPECTFULLY,</i> <i> BUT PAULA SAYS THE VISITS</i> <i> OFTEN INCLUDED A STOP</i> <i> WHICH HAD A POLITICAL AGENDA.</i> THEY WOULD ALSO TAKE THEM TO THE ARSENAL AND THEY'D SHOW THEM STOCKPILES OF WEAPONS AND CANNONBALLS AND THEY WOULD HAVE DISPLAYS OF MILITARY MIGHT. THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SHOW THEM THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY FUTILE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LANDS. THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE? THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE. <i> CRAZY HORSE'S GRANDSON</i> <i> HAD TOLD ME</i> <i> THAT THE CLOTHING</i> <i> AND DECORATION IN OUR IMAGE</i> <i> WAS NOT TYPICAL</i> <i> FOR THE WARRIOR.</i> <i> BUT PAULA SAYS NOT ALL THE</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN WASHINGTON</i> <i> WERE WHAT THEY APPEARED TO BE.</i> SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS ACTUALLY KEPT PROPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIANS LOOKED EXOTIC ENOUGH, AND SOMETIMES THEY PUT THE IMPROPER COSTUMES ON THE WRONG CULTURES. <i> PAULA HAS A SURPRISE FOR ME.</i> WITH THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE ARCHIVES, IT CAN BE A LITTLE DAUNTING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NAME. BUT I DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH, AND COME HERE, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. WOW! <i> IT'S A GLASS PLATE NEGATIVE,</i> <i> JUST LIKE THE ONE</i> <i> DON SHOWED ME.</i> IT'S THE EXACT SAME IMAGE. SURE IS. THIS NEGATIVE WAS USED TO PRINT THAT IMAGE. IS IT CRAZY HORSE? <i> WHAT PAULA TELLS ME NEXT</i> <i> CLOSES THE CASE.</i> WELL, TIM, IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE INVESTIGATION. <i> I TELL HIM HE HAS AN AUTHENTIC</i> <i> ALEXANDER GARDNER PHOTO,</i> <i> ONE OF THE NATION'S</i> <i> MOST CELEBRATED</i> <i> PERIOD PHOTOGRAPHERS.</i> THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPERTS THAT DON'T BELIEVE THAT CRAZY HORSE WAS EVER PHOTOGRAPHED, AND THAT MADE IT REALLY DIFFICULT. FINALLY, THOUGH, I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAN IN YOUR PHOTOGRAPH BY TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON, D.C., JUST LIKE HE DID 150 YEARS AGO. THERE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM HENRY BLACKMORE, AND HE COMMISSIONED GARDNER TO PHOTOGRAPH THE DELEGATIONS OF INDIANS. AND HE ALSO PUBLISHED THE IMAGES. THAT'S OUR GUY. THE MAN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH IS VUA-SHA-PEH, WHOSE ENGLISH NAME IS STABBER, AND HE WAS AN OGLALA LAKOTA WHO CAME TO WASHINGTON, D.C., WITH RED CLOUD ON A DELEGATION. <i> THE MAN IN THIS PHOTOGRAPHED</i> <i> HAD WITNESSED</i> <i> ONE OF THE LAST</i> <i> PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS</i> <i> BETWEEN THE LAKOTA</i> <i> AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</i> <i> BEFORE GOLD WAS DISCOVERED</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS.</i> HE WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LAKOTA HISTORY. I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE KNOW WHO HE IS NOW. <i> VUA-SHA-PEH HAD TRAVELED</i> <i> TO WASHINGTON</i> <i> WITH RED CLOUD</i> <i> AND THE LAKOTA DELEGATION.</i> <i> IN CONTRAST, CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> REJECTED DIPLOMACY</i> <i> AND DEFENDED LAKOTA TRADITIONS</i> <i> AS A WARRIOR TO THE END.</i> EXPERTS SAY THAT HE NEVER WENT TO WASHINGTON; HE STAYED ON HIS LAND TO FIGHT FOR HIS PEOPLE AND TO FIGHT THE U.S. MILITARY. I'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF CRAZY HORSE, AND I REALLY HOPED THAT THIS WAS HIM. WELL, I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT CRAZY HORSE LOOKED LIKE. I HOPE THAT I CAN TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH AND FIND HIS DESCENDANTS AND PASS THE PHOTOGRAPH DOWN TO THEM. WE THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO GIVE US THE NEWS. <i> AFTER HIS VICTORY</i> <i> AT THE LITTLE BIGHORN,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE FOUGHT ON</i> <i> UNTIL THE SPRING OF 1877.</i> <i> THEN, HIS PEOPLE WEAKENED</i> <i> BY WAR AND HUNGER,</i> <i> HE SURRENDERED</i> <i> AT CAMP ROBINSON, NEBRASKA.</i> <i> ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1877,</i> <i> HE WAS ARRESTED AND BROUGHT</i> <i> INTO THE GUARD HOUSE.</i> <i> REALIZING HE WAS</i> <i> ABOUT TO BE LOCKED UP,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE STRUGGLED</i> <i> AND WAS STABBED</i> <i> BY A SOLDIER</i> <i> WITH A BAYONET.</i> <i> HE DIED LATE THAT NIGHT,</i> <i> AND SOON AFTER,</i> <i> HIS BODY WAS RETURNED</i> <i> TO HIS ELDERLY PARENTS.</i> <i> TO THIS DAY, HIS FINAL</i> <i> BURIAL PLACE IS UNKNOWN,</i> <i> BUT HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS.</i> REPATRIATION RAISES COMPLEX ISSUES ABOUT CULTURAL HERITAGE AND WHO OWNS IT. TODAY, LITERALLY MILLIONS OF AMERICAN INDIAN ARTIFACTS ARE HOUSED IN NON-NATIVE MUSEUMS AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS. MANY OF THESE OBJECTS, LIKE TOOLS, WEAPONS, AND CLOTHES, WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH PERFECTLY LEGAL MEANS. OTHERS, HOWEVER, WERE BOUGHT FOR PENNIES OR STOLEN. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SAW NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS, SINCE ITS OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE TRIBES WAS TO TRY TO ASSIMILATE THEM INTO THE MAINSTREAM. BUT NATIVE PEOPLES ARE STILL WITH US, AND SOME HAVE BEGUN TO ASK FOR -
- EVEN DEMAND -
- THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ARTIFACTS BACK. SO IN 1990, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVE PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT, OR NAGPRA. NAGPRA REQUIRES FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS TO RETURN SKELETONS AND OBJECTS OF CULTURAL PATRIMONY TO TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES IF THEY FOLLOW THE CORRECT PROCEDURES. NAGPRA ONLY APPLIES TO FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS. PRIVATE COLLECTIONS OR MUSEUMS ABROAD DON'T FALL UNDER ITS JURISDICTION. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, BOTH THE TRIBES AND MUSEUMS SEE NAGPRA AS A STEP FORWARD. Wes: <i> IN AN ENCORE PRESENTATION,</i> <i> OUR FINAL STORY TURNS THE PAGES</i> <i> OF A LONG-LOST DIARY</i> <i> FROM A WORLD WAR II</i> <i> BOMBER PILOT.</i> <i> DECEMBER 13, 1943:</i> <i> THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE</i> <i> 445th BOMB GROUP</i> <i> ATTACKS ENEMY SHIPYARDS</i> <i> BENEATH THE SKIES</i> <i> OF KIEL, GERMANY.</i> <i> IT'S THEIR FIRST</i> <i> OF 280 AIR-RAID MISSIONS</i> <i> INSIDE A NEW BOMBER</i> <i> CALLED THE B-24 LIBERATOR.</i> <i> THE BOMBER IS</i> <i> THE ALLIES' GREAT HOPE,</i> <i> FLYING FARTHER, LONGER,</i> <i> AND CARRYING MORE BOMBS</i> <i> DEEP INTO HITLER'S</i> <i> GERMANY.</i> <i> NOT A SINGLE PLANE IS LOST</i> <i> ON THIS MISSION,</i> <i> BUT THE 445th WILL RARELY</i> <i> BE SO LUCKY AGAIN.</i> <i> THE LIBERATOR EARNS ITSELF</i> <i> ANOTHER MORE OMINOUS NICKNAME:</i> <i> THE FLYING COFFIN,</i> <i> DUE TO THE HIGH CASUALTY RATE</i> <i> AMONG B-24 PILOTS.</i> <i> WHY WERE THESE MISSIONS</i> <i> SO DEADLY,</i> <i> AND WHAT CONVINCED THEIR CREW</i> <i> TO ACCEPT SUCH TERRIBLE ODDS?</i> <i> SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE LAST</i> <i> OF THOSE MISSIONS,</i> <i> JIM CHAPMAN</i> <i> OF LEXINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA,</i> <i> HAS A DIARY THAT MAY REVEAL</i> <i> NEW INFORMATION</i> <i> ABOUT THESE PLANES AND MEN</i> <i> WHO HELD HITLER AT BAY.</i> <i> I'M WES COWAN,</i> <i> AND I'M HEADING TO MEET JIM.</i> NICE TO MEET YOU. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DIARY. MY DAD BROUGHT THIS HOME WITH HIM AFTER HE FINISHED HIS TOUR OF DUTY DURING WORLD WAR II. AND THE OBVIOUS QUESTION TO ME IS, IT'S NOT YOUR DAD'S DIARY. THAT'S CORRECT. THE DIARY BELONGED TO HIS CO-PILOT NAMED WILLIAM MORAN. BOTH SERVED ON A B-24. <i> BOTH MEN FLEW PLANES</i> <i> IN THE 445th BOMB GROUP</i> <i> STATIONED IN</i> <i> TIBENHAM, ENGLAND.</i> HOW DID YOUR DAD GET IT? WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I ACTUALLY DISCOVERED THE DIARY IN A BOX OF MY FATHER'S MEMENTOS. <i> HE DISCOVERED IT AFTER</i> <i> HIS FATHER DIED 20 YEARS AGO.</i> CAN YOU READ ME SOME ENTRIES? YES, I'D BE GLAD TO. SURE DREADED GOING, ESPECIALLY AFTER I FOUND THE TARGET TO BE HAMBURG. FELT SURE I WOULDN'T GET BACK. AT LEAST I KNOW NOW THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO FACE DEATH WHEN MY TIME COMES. THE ONLY THING THAT I FEARED WAS LEAVING JAYNE. I ADORE HER EVERY BREATH. <i> MARY JAYNE</i> <i> WAS MORAN'S WIFE.</i> <i> IT'S THESE PERSONAL DETAILS</i> <i> IN THE DIARY THAT HAUNT JIM.</i> MAY 9, 1944. AN AIRMAIL LETTER FROM MY ANGEL. MY BABY IS PRETTY SURE SHE IS PREGNANT. THANK GOD! BOUGHT THE BOYS BEER WITH MY LAST SIX SHILLINGS TO CELEBRATE. THAT'S REALLY GREAT. <i> THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT</i> <i> MISSING FROM THIS DIARY:</i> <i> AN ENDING.</i> <i> THE LAST ENTRY IS</i> <i> FROM OCTOBER 29th,</i> <i> SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THE END</i> <i> OF THE WAR IN EUROPE.</i> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WELL, WES, I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO BILL MORAN, IF HE CAME BACK HOME OR IF HE WAS KILLED. I'D LIKE TO REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. <i> JIM IS EAGER</i> <i> TO KNOW MORE ABOUT</i> <i> WHAT THE MEN HIS FATHER FLEW</i> <i> WITH SAW AND DID</i> <i> DURING THEIR TIME</i> <i> IN ENGLAND.</i> <i> AND HE WANTS HELP</i> <i> WITH ANOTHER QUESTION, TOO.</i> I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REUNITE THE DIARY WITH BILL MORAN'S FAMILY. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILY TO HAVE THIS. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE DIARY WITH ME, AND I'M READY TO GET GOING. WELL, LET'S SEE. EVERY TIME I READ ONE OF THESE SOLDIER'S DIARIES, I JUST GET THE SENSE THAT I'M HOLDING A PIECE OF HISTORY IN MY HAND. <i> THE DIARY COVERS</i> <i> ABOUT A YEAR,</i> <i> FROM OCTOBER 1943</i> <i> TO OCTOBER 1944.</i> <i> MUCH OF IT</i> <i> IS WRITTEN MECHANICALLY,</i> <i> MORE LIKE A LOG</i> <i> THAN A PERSONAL JOURNAL.</i> <i> BUT IT'S CLEAR HIS UNIT IS</i> <i> IN THE THICK OF THE ACTION.</i> HERE'S ONE, SEPTEMBER 27th. STARTED A LETTER TO MY ANGEL, BUT BAHN STOPPED IN TO TELL ME OUR SQUAD LOST FOUR OUT OF NINE. IT WAS WITHEY'S LAST ONE. <i> A LOT OF BOMBERS WENT DOWN</i> <i> WITH MEN MORAN KNEW.</i> <i> IF HE'S SHAKEN BY THIS,</i> <i> I WOULDN'T KNOW IT</i> <i> FROM THE MATTER-OF-FACT</i> <i> LANGUAGE.</i> <i> AND HERE'S BILL MORAN'S</i> <i> LAST ENTRY,</i> <i> OCTOBER 29, 1944.</i> <i> MORE DEATH AND MORE</i> <i> MATTER-OF-FACT LANGUAGE.</i> BILL WRITES, MASS AND COMMUNION. PUT A COUPLE HOURS ON A SHIP. HEARD A ROTTEN GERMAN BROADCAST LATE LAST NIGHT CALLING EISENHOWER A RAT. <i> BUT THERE ARE NO CLUES</i> <i> WHY MORAN STOPPED WRITING.</i> <i> DID HE GO BACK HOME OR WAS</i> <i> HIS NEXT MISSION FATAL?</i> <i> THERE ARE PLENTY</i> <i> OF NAMES HERE.</i> <i> MAYBE SOMEONE BILL MORAN</i> <i> WROTE ABOUT IS STILL ALIVE</i> <i> AND CAN FILL IN</i> <i> THESE BLANK PAGES FOR ME.</i> LENNY, IT LOOKS LIKE. GOLDEN. CHAPPY, PELTON, AND I WERE LUCKY NOT TO GO. <i> I'LL CALL MY OFFICE AND ASK</i> <i> THEM TO TRY TO TRACK DOWN</i> <i> SOME OF BILL MORAN'S</i> <i> WAR BUDDIES.</i> WES COWAN. BILL OLDSON. GLAD TO MEET YOU, WES. <i> WHILE THEY'RE SEARCHING,</i> <i> I'VE COME TO FLORIDA</i> <i> TO MEET WITH PROFESSOR</i> <i> WILLIAM OLDSON</i> <i> FROM THE INSTITUTE</i> <i> ON WORLD WAR II</i> <i> AND THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE.</i> HERE'S THE DIARY THAT I SENT YOU THE TRANSCRIPT OF. OH, NICE. VERY UNUSUAL COVER. AND IF I MUST SAY, HIS HANDWRITING'S BETTER THAN MOST, TOO. <i> WILLIAM SAYS UNEARTHING</i> <i> JOURNALS FROM THE BATTLEFRONT</i> <i> IS ALWAYS</i> <i> AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY,</i> <i> A UNIQUE WINDOW ON THE MEN</i> <i> WHO ACTUALLY DID THE FIGHTING.</i> IT'S THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH, AND IT'S THE YARDSTICK YOU CAN HOLD UP TO EVERYTHING ELSE -
- TO THE LETTERS HOME, TO THE PROPAGANDA, TO THE NEWSREEL -
- AND SAY, HERE'S WHAT HE FELT. <i> AND THERE CERTAINLY WAS</i> <i> A LOT TO WRITE ABOUT.</i> <i> WILLIAM EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> IN 1943,</i> <i> ALLIED BOMBING RAIDS ON GERMANY</i> <i> ARE OFTEN INEFFECTUAL</i> <i> AT HITTING MILITARY</i> <i> AND INDUSTRIAL TARGETS.</i> <i> BUT BY 1944, WITH FORD CRANKING</i> <i> OUT A NEW B-24 EVERY HOUR,</i> <i> THE AMERICAN BOMBERS</i> <i> ARE SUCCESSFULLY TARGETING</i> <i> HITLER'S FACTORIES</i> <i> AND FUEL SUPPLIES</i> <i> AND HELPING TURN THE WAR</i> <i> IN THE ALLIES' FAVOR.</i> <i> BUT THE CARNAGE AMONG</i> <i> FLIGHT CREWS IS HORRENDOUS.</i> IN '43, WE LOST OVER 3,000 PLANES. '44, WE LOSE OVER 11,000 PLANES. <i> WILLIAM BELIEVES</i> <i> THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE</i> <i> MORAN WAS KILLED</i> <i> OVER GERMANY.</i> <i> FLYING DAYLIGHT RAIDS</i> <i> MADE THE BOMBERS EASY PREY</i> <i> FOR GERMAN FIGHTER PLANES</i> <i> AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS.</i> IF YOU WERE FLYING WITH BRITISH BOMBER COMMAND, YOU HAD A 65% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY. IF YOU'RE FLYING IN THE AMERICAN 8th AIR FORCE, YOU'VE GOT A 40% TO 60% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY. IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE IN THAT KAMIKAZE SQUADRON, YOU'VE ONLY GOT A 53% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. <i> WHILE LOGISTICS PROBLEMS</i> <i> OFTEN KEPT JAPANESE KAMIKAZE</i> <i> SQUADRONS GROUNDED,</i> <i> IN EUROPE,</i> <i> THE BIG ALLIED BOMBERS</i> <i> WERE SEEING COMBAT</i> <i> ALMOST DAILY.</i> SO A KAMIKAZE PILOT WHO'S SUPPOSED TO KILL HIMSELF STOOD A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVING THAN A B-24 BOMBER PILOT? HARD TO BELIEVE, ISN'T IT? <i> WILLIAM SAYS THE OFTEN REMOTE,</i> <i> MATTER-OF-FACT LANGUAGE</i> <i> IN SUCH WARTIME WRITING</i> <i> WAS A WAY OF WALLING OFF</i> <i> OR ESCAPING</i> <i> THE HORROR</i> <i> OF EVERYDAY LIFE.</i> I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY TYPICAL, IT'S NECESSARY. THEY CAN'T BROOD ABOUT IT. IT'S GOING TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE, IT'S GOING TO DEPRESS THEM. <i> THE WRITING IS A FORM</i> <i> OF SELF-DEFENSE.</i> WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT THE DIARY YOU HAVE IS THE ROMANTIC ASPECT OF IT. I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER DIARY THAT I'VE SEEN WHERE SOMEBODY'S REFERRING TO HIS WIFE AS ANGEL. AND WE HAVE LOTS OF LETTERS WHERE IT SAYS, HELLO, HONEY, OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT, BUT NOT IN THE DIARIES. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR SHARING THIS WITH ME. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SEE THIS. THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DOCUMENT. <i> I STILL DON'T KNOW</i> <i> EXACTLY WHY</i> <i> BILL MORAN STOPPED WRITING</i> <i> IN THE JOURNAL,</i> <i> BUT MY OFFICE</i> <i> HAS BEEN ABLE</i> <i> TO TRACK DOWN</i> <i> HIS MILITARY RECORDS,</i> <i> AND THEY'VE SENT THEM</i> <i> TO ME AT THE LIBRARY.</i> <i> IT'S SOBERING NEWS.</i> <i> ON OCTOBER 31, 1944,</i> <i> BILL MORAN WAS FLYING</i> <i> WITH PILOT EDWARD SPEERS</i> <i> AND SIX OTHER MEN</i> <i> WHEN THEIR PLANE DISAPPEARED.</i> THIS REPORT OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT OR MISSING AIRCRAFT REPORT CONFIRMS THAT MORAN WAS KILLED IN SOME SORT OF A TRAINING ACCIDENT. THEY'RE NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. HE TOOK OFF IN THE FORMATION. AFTER HE TOOK OFF, NOBODY ELSE IN THE AIRCRAFT FORMATION EVER SAW HIM AGAIN. <i> THE WRECKAGE AND MORAN'S BODY</i> <i> ARE NEVER FOUND.</i> THIS TOOK PLACE TWO DAYS AFTER THE LAST ENTRY IN HIS DIARY. <i> MARY JAYNE WAS SEVEN MONTHS</i> <i> PREGNANT WHEN BILL DIED.</i> <i> IF I'M GOING TO HELP JIM RETURN</i> <i> THE JOURNAL TO BILL'S FAMILY,</i> <i> I'M GOING TO NEED HELP</i> <i> TRACKING DOWN HIS DESCENDANTS.</i> <i> MY OFFICE HAS LOCATED</i> <i> JACK PELTON,</i> <i> ONE OF MORAN'S BUDDIES</i> <i> MENTIONED IN THE DIARY.</i> HEY, JACK. HEY, WES. <i> JACK AGREES TO MEET ME</i> <i> AT THE AMERICAN AERO SERVICES</i> <i> HANGAR IN FLORIDA,</i> <i> WHERE THE COLLINGS FOUNDATION</i> <i> MAINTAINS A B-24 BOMBER.</i> BOY, THIS IS QUITE A PIECE OF MACHINERY, ISN'T IT? OH, IT REALLY IS, IT'S A WONDERFUL AIRPLANE. AND YOU WERE A PILOT OF ONE OF THESE BIRDS. I WAS A PILOT, FLEW 32 MISSIONS. HOW'D YOU LIKE TO GET UP IN THE COCKPIT? LOVE TO. OH, WONDERFUL. <i> IT'S BEEN MORE THAN 50 YEARS</i> <i> SINCE JACK'S TAKEN A SEAT</i> <i> AT THE CONTROLS.</i> SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO FLY ONE OF THESE BABIES? IT WAS VERY EXCITING, REALLY. <i> JACK TELLS ME</i> <i> IN ORDER TO ATTACK</i> <i> HEAVILY DEFENDED TARGETS,</i> <i> PILOTS LIKE HE</i> <i> AND BILL MORAN FLEW</i> <i> AT ALTITUDES</i> <i> OVER 20,000 FEET,</i> <i> WHERE TEMPERATURES REACHED</i> <i> MINUS 30 DEGREES.</i> SO IT WAS COLD, YOU'RE WEARING AN OXYGEN MASK. THERE ARE NO HYDRAULICS IN THESE STEERING WHEELS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HELL OF A JOB. IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING. YOU WERE IN ANOTHER WORLD. <i> JACK EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> THE LIGHTWEIGHT FRAME</i> <i> THAT MADE THE B-24</i> <i> SUCH AN EFFICIENT BOMBER</i> <i> ALSO MADE IT VULNERABLE</i> <i> TO ENEMY FIRE.</i> WE BROUGHT ONE PLANE HOME WITH 153 HOLES IN IT. [ machine gun firing ] <i> BULLETS AND SHELLS</i> <i> FROM GERMAN FIGHTER PLANES</i> <i> TORE THROUGH</i> <i> THE AMERICAN AIRCRAFT</i> <i> AND HELPED EARN THE B-24</i> <i> ITS REPUTATION</i> <i> AS A FLYING COFFIN.</i> YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT BILL MORAN'S DIARY HERE. WHAT KIND OF A GUY WAS BILL MORAN? WHAT WAS HE LIKE? BILL MORAN WAS A GREAT CO-PILOT, GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, IRISHMAN ALL THE WAY. <i> JACK HAS A PICTURE</i> <i> OF BILL AND MARY JAYNE,</i> <i> BILL'S PREGNANT WIFE,</i> <i> TAKEN RIGHT BEFORE</i> <i> THE AIRMAN LEFT THE STATES.</i> SO THAT'S BILL. BILL. THAT'S MARY JAYNE. AND LOOK AT THEM HOLDING HANDS THERE. I'D RECOGNIZE YOU ANYWHERE. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE HAVING A LOT OF FUN. YEAH, WE DID, HAD A GREAT EVENING. LAST TIME WE SAW OUR WIVES FOR A YEAR. ONE MORE QUESTION: WHERE WAS BILL MORAN FROM? PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA. MARY JAYNE WAS FROM THERE, TOO, THEN? YES, SHE WAS. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO MARY JAYNE, DO YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. I TRIED TO FIND HER WHEN I GOT BACK IN THE STATES, COULD NOT. ONE TIME WHEN I WAS ON BUSINESS IN PITTSBURGH, I HEARD SHE WAS THERE, BUT I STILL COULDN'T TRACK HER DOWN. <i> SO I'M BACK</i> <i> AT THE LIBRARY</i> <i> TO SEARCH THROUGH</i> <i> GENEALOGICAL RECORDS.</i> <i> AT FIRST, I DRAW A BLANK</i> <i> LOOKING FOR MARY JAYNE.</i> <i> MAYBE I CAN GET INFORMATION</i> <i> FROM ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER.</i> <i> I FINALLY GET A BREAK</i> <i> WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY</i> <i> DEATH INDEX</i> <i> FOR BILL'S MOTHER VERONICA.</i> BINGO, HERE SHE IS. SHE DIED IN MARCH 1967 IN MIAMI, FLORIDA. <i> HER OBITUARY</i> <i> EVENTUALLY LEADS US</i> <i> TO THE NAMES OF TWO</i> <i> OF BILL'S SURVIVING SISTERS:</i> <i> ADELAIDE YOUNG</i> <i> AND JEANIE KIMBROW</i> <i> OF SEBRING, FLORIDA.</i> <i> IF THERE'S A LOCAL LISTING,</i> <i> MAYBE WE'RE IN BUSINESS.</i> <i> IT TAKES A WHILE,</i> <i> BUT EVENTUALLY I GET LUCKY.</i> ADELAIDE YOUNG, THERE'S HER PHONE NUMBER, ADDRESS, BORN AUGUST 1930. IT'S GOT TO BE HER. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE FOUND A LIVING RELATIVE. HELLO, MRS. YOUNG? <i> ADELAIDE IS EXCITED</i> <i> BY NEWS OF THE DIARY,</i> <i> AND WE MAKE PLANS</i> <i> TO MEET.</i> YOU KNOW WHY I'VE COME TO SEE YOU. YES. I HAVE A DIARY THAT WAS WRITTEN BY YOUR BROTHER. OH, MY LIFE IN THE SERVICE. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT HANDWRITING? OH, OF COURSE. <i> IT'S THE CONSTANT REFERENCES</i> <i> TO BILL'S WIFE</i> <i> THAT CATCH ADELAIDE'S EYE.</i> HE ALWAYS SPEAKS OF HER IN SUCH A GENTLE WAY. YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY WERE REALLY IN LOVE. OH, FROM THE TIME THEY MET. <i> ADELAIDE WAS 14</i> <i> WHEN HER BROTHER DIED.</i> THE TELEGRAM WAS LAYING ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE, AND WE KEPT SAYING, THEY'LL FIND HIM, THEY'LL FIND HIM. SOMEDAY THEY'LL FIND HIM. THERE WAS NEVER ANY MEMORIAL SERVICE OR ANYTHING BECAUSE SOMEDAY THEY'LL FIND HIM. <i> AT FIRST THE VERY PREGNANT</i> <i> MARY JAYNE</i> <i> WASN'T EVEN TOLD</i> <i> HER HUSBAND WAS MISSING.</i> <i> SHE LEARNED BILL</i> <i> HAD BEEN KILLED</i> <i> FROM A FRIEND</i> <i> WHO VISITED HER</i> <i> RIGHT AFTER SHE'D GIVEN BIRTH</i> <i> TO THEIR DAUGHTER.</i> SHE WAS INCONSOLABLE. SHE WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLY IN GRIEF. <i> MARY JAYNE DIED ROUGHLY</i> <i> 20 YEARS AFTER HER HUSBAND,</i> <i> BUT WHAT ADELAIDE</i> <i> REVEALED NEXT</i> <i> WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY NEWS</i> <i> FOR JIM.</i> THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE STORY FOR ME. <i> I TELL JIM ABOUT SOME OF</i> <i> THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED</i> <i> WHILE WORKING</i> <i> ON BILL'S DIARY.</i> I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THOUGH, THAT I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS. <i> I LET JIM KNOW THAT BILL MORAN</i> <i> DIED IN A TRAINING MISSION</i> <i> AND HIS WIFE PASSED AWAY</i> <i> OVER 40 YEARS AGO,</i> <i> BUT THE STORY</i> <i> DOESN'T END THERE.</i> THERE'S SOMEONE I DO WANT YOU TO MEET, SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME, WE'LL GO MEET THAT PERSON. I'D LIKE TO DO THAT. <i> ADELAIDE TOLD ME</i> <i> THAT THE BABY</i> <i> THAT BILL WAS</i> <i> SO EAGERLY EXPECTING</i> <i> WAS BORN 32 DAYS</i> <i> AFTER HE DIED.</i> <i> HER NAME WAS JANIE.</i> SHE'S MARRIED. SHE HAS TWO CHILDREN AND FOUR GRANDCHILDREN. <i> BILL MORAN WOULD HAVE BEEN</i> <i> A GREAT-GRANDFATHER.</i> HEY, GUYS. HI. I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEBODY, JIM. THIS IS JIM CHAPMAN. THIS IS CHAPPY'S SON. HI, HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS ADELAIDE YOUNG. THIS IS BILL'S SISTER. I REMEMBER HIM TALKING ABOUT -
- OH, HI, ADELAIDE. HE TALKED ABOUT BILL CHAPMAN ALL THE TIME. OH, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU. OH, I'M SO GLAD TO MEET YOU. AND THIS IS BILL'S DAUGHTER, JANIE. HI, JIM, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF THE JOURNAL. I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE FOUND YOU. <i> THANKS TO JIM,</i> <i> BILL MORAN'S THOUGHTS</i> <i> ARE NOW FINALLY GOING HOME</i> <i> TO THE DAUGHTER</i> <i> HE NEVER KNEW.</i> I JUST FEEL LIKE I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT YOU ALREADY. [ clears throat ] EXCUSE ME. SORRY. THE DIARY'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY FOR 63 YEARS. WHAT WAS SO FASCINATING WAS READING IN THE DIARY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER CARRYING YOU AND YOUR DAD BEING SO HAPPY AND EXCITED ABOUT YOUR MOM BEING PREGNANT. IN THE DIARY ITSELF, IT JUST COMES THROUGH THAT HE LOVES YOUR MOTHER VERY MUCH. <i> MORAN AND HIS FELLOW PILOTS</i> <i> HAD HELPED DEAL HITLER'S</i> <i> WAR MACHINE A CRIPPLING BLOW,</i> <i> AND THEIR CHILDREN</i> <i> AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN</i> <i> WOULD LIVE IN A WORLD</i> <i> THEY HAD TRANSFORMED.</i> THIS IS A GLIMPSE INTO YOUR FATHER'S LIFE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JIM, FOR TREASURING IT AND TAKING CARE OF IT FOR ALL THOSE YEARS. TO HEAR MORE ABOUT JACK PELTON'S EXPERIENCES AS A WORLD WAR II BOMBER PILOT, VISIT<i> HISTORY DETECTIVES</i> ON THE WEB AT pbs.org. Tukufu: BILL MORAN ALSO WROTE IN HIS DIARY ABOUT THE KASSEL MISSION. IT'S THE BIGGEST SINGLE LOSS FOR AN AMERICAN BOMBER GROUP IN THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY HISTORY. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1944. BAHN STOPPED IN TO TELL ME THAT WE LOST 22 OUT OF 35 SHIPS. WITHEY, GOLDEN, BOECHER, ROBINSON, AND REYNOLDS DIDN'T GET BACK. JACK PELTON REMEMBERS THAT DAY WELL. THEY CALLED ME FOR THAT MISSION AND I HAD A PASS TO GO TO LONDON. AND I SHOWED THE SERGEANT MY PASS, AND HE SAID, OKAY, TOOK THE GUY IN THE NEXT BUNK, AND HE NEVER CAME HOME. THIRTY-NINE PLANES FROM THE 445th BOMB GROUP SET OUT TO ATTACK A TANK FACTORY IN KASSEL, GERMANY. BUT THE LEAD PLANE MAKES A WRONG TURN, AND THE 445th GETS SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE COMBAT WING. ALONE OVER ENEMY TERRITORY, THE LIBERATORS ARE AMBUSHED BY OVER 100 GERMAN FIGHTERS. IN LESS THAN FOUR MINUTES, 116 AMERICAN PILOTS ARE DEAD. SURVIVORS RETURNING TO BASE RECOUNT THE HORROR. THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH BOMBERS BLOWING UP AND FALLING BOMBER PARTS, PARACHUTES, AND BODIES, AND BODY PARTS. IT WAS A REAL HOLOCAUST. SOME OF THE GUYS CAME BACK, THEY WERE ALMOST HYSTERICAL. THEY COULD HARDLY CONTAIN THEMSELVES. THOUGH THE LOSS IS TRAGIC, THE WAR GOES ON. THE NEXT DAY, THE MILITARY SENDS ANOTHER BOMBER GROUP BACK TO KASSEL TO FINISH THE JOB. ALL OF THOSE PLANES RETURNED SAFELY.
