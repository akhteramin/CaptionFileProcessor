 AND TODAY NANCY PELOSI SAID TODAY HE'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.
 THE GREATER QUESTION IS WHETHER
 IMPEACHMENT HAS BECOME A DUTY.
 IF THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES BELIEVES TRUMP
 OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE AS I BELIEVE
 IT DOES, ISN'T THERE A DUTY TO
 ACT?
 AS THE WRITER FOR THE NEW YORKER
 PUT IT THIS WEEK, IMPEACHMENT
 MAY BE TOO GOOD FOR TRUMP.
 AND MAY YET PROVE JUST THE THING
 FOR THE COUNTRY.
 IS IT BETTER TO WAIT FOR SUCH A
 CONSTITUTIONAL EXPLOSION OR TO
 ACT NOW UPON THE LETHAL
 ACCUMULATION OF PUBLIC EVIDENCE
 MR. TRUMP HAS ALREADY PILED
 HIGH.
 THAT IS "HARDBALL" FOR NOW.
 "ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES" STARTS
 RIGHT NOW.
 TONIGHT ON "ALL IN."
 DO WE LIKE TUCKER?
 A FULL-BLOWN SCANDAL AT TRUMP
 TV.
 SHE'S MY FRIEND AND SHE'S
 YOUR FRIEND.
 JUSTICE JEANNINE.
 WHY FOX NEWS IS CONDEMNING
 ONE OF ITS OWN.
 IS HER ADHERENCE TO THIS
 ISLAMIC DOCTRINE INDICATIVE OF
 HER ADHERENCE TO SHARIA LAW.
 AS THE PRESIDENT KEEPS
 LOWERING THE BAR.
 DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE
 THAT DEMOCRATS HATE JEWS.
 AND THEN DAVE CORN ON NEW
 REPORTING ABOUT MAR-A-LARGO AND
 THE MASSAGE PARLOR MAGNATE
 SELLING ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT.
 AND MEDI HASAN.
 THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE
 TRUMP TOWER MEETING.
 THEY GOT THE TRANSCRIPT
 WRONG.
 AND SHERROD BROWN DECIDING
 NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
 WHEN "ALL IN" STARTS RIGHT NOW.
 GOOD EVENING FROM NEW YORK,
 I'M CHRIS HAYES, BREAKING NEWS
 IN THE SCANDAL THAT IS ENGULFING
 FOX NEWS.
 MORE AUDIO HAS BEEN UNEARTHED
 WHICH WE HAVE HERE EXCLUSIVELY
 OF ONE OF THE CHANNEL'S PRIME
 TIME HOST USING A HOMOFOEBISM
 SLUR AND CALLING THE PEOPLE OF
 IRAQ SEMI LITERAL PRIMITIVE
 MONKEYS WHO HE HAD ZERO SYMPATHY
 BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE TOILET
 PAPER OR FORKS.
 SOME RACIALLY GROSS THINGS SAID
 ABOUT BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA
 AND THE AUDIO JUST BROKE AND
 WE'LL SHOW YOU THAT SHORTLY.
 THERE IS NEVER A MEDIA OUTLET
 MORE IMPORTANT THAN FOX TO NEWS.
 HE WATCHES IT ALL DAY AND LIVE
 TWEETS "FOX AND FRIENDS" AND
 SOMETIMES ON DELAY BECAUSE HE
 DVRs IT AND SENDS ADVERTISEMENTS
 FOR IT AND THEY RUN INTERFERENCE
 FOR HIM AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO
 KNOW WHERE ONE ENDS AND THE
 OTHER BEGINS.
 LESS THAN A WEEK AGO DISGRACED
 EXECUTIVE BILL SHINE WAS THE
 WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS
 DIRECTOR BEFORE GETTING TURFED
 OUT SO IF THE PRESIDENT SITS
 DOWN AT MAR-A-LARGO ON WHAT IS
 GOING ON IN THE WORLD, THIS IS
 THE THING YOU MIGHT SEE.
 OMAR WEARS A HIJAB WHICH
 ACCORDING TO THE KORAN, 33 COLON
 59 TELLS WOMEN TO COVER SO THEY
 WON'T GET MOLESTED.
 IS HER ADHERENCE TO THIS ISLAMIC
 DOCTRINE INDICATIVE TO HER
 ADHERENCE TO SHARIA LAW WHICH IS
 ANTITHETICAL TO THE UNITED
 STATES CONSTITUTION.
 IS HER RELIGION DEVOTION
 ANTITHETICAL TO THE U.S.
 CONSTITUTION?
 GREAT QUESTION.
 THE ON THE FACE BIGOTED COMMENT
 IS NOT OUT OF STEP WITH THE REST
 OF THE RHETORIC AT FOX NEWS
 WHERE ANTI-MUSLIM IS PART OF THE
 PROGRAMMING.
 THEY SAID WE STRONGLY CONDEMN
 JEANINE PIRRO'S COMMENTS ABOUT
 ILHAN OMAR AND WE HAVE ADDRESSED
 THE MATTER WITH HER DIRECTLY.
 SHE SAID SHE DID NOT CALL HER
 UNAMERICAN, MY INTENTION WAS TO
 ASK A QUESTION AND START A
 DEBATE BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE ONE
 IS MUSLIM DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T
 SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION.
 SHE'S JUST ASKING QUESTIONS,
 PEOPLE.
 JUST PUTTING FORWARD IDEAS TO
 DISCUSS LIKE TUCKER CARLSON
 DOES.
 HE'S ALWAYS JUST ASKING QUESTION
 TZ.
 NOT DEFENDING ANYTHING, JUST
 ASKING QUESTIONS.
 I'M NOT DEFENDING TRUMP --
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WHAT HE
 SAID ON THE TAPE.
 I'M NOT DEFENDING IT.
 I'M NOT DEFENDING WHITE
 SUPREMACY.
 YOU DEFEND THE UGLINESS OF A
 LOT OF THINGS ONLINE.
 I'M NOT DEFENDING THE CREEPINESS
 ON THE INTERNET.
 I HATE IT LIKE YOU DO.
 AND EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT
 TUCKER IS DOING WHEN HE SAID
 THIS INCLUDING WHITE SUPREMACIST
 WHO RECENTLY LEAKED CHATS ARE
 PRAISING CARLSON FOR HOW HE
 INJECTED IDEALS OF WHITE
 NATIONALISM TO THE DISCOURSE
 THROUGH THIS COWARDLY
 DISASSOCIATION WITH HIS OWN
 VIEWS BUT CARLSON HAS BEEN DOING
 THIS SHSTICK FOREVER.
 HE'S MADE ON SHOCK JOCK RADIO
 BETWEEN 2006 AND 2011 ABOUT,
 AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS, WHEN
 CHILD RAPE IS OKAY AND
 DEFENSIBLE.
 YOU COULD TELL FROM LISTENING
 THEY ARE NOT MADE IN JEST.
 WELL HE -WARREN JEFFS
 DIDN'T MARRY UND AGE GIRLS.
 HE'S IN PRISON FOR
 PRECIPITATION OF CHILD RAPE.
 WHATEVER THE HELL THAT MEANS.
 HE'S IN PRISON BECAUSE HE'S
 WEIRD AND UNPOPULAR AND HAS A
 DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE THAT PEOPLE
 FIND CREEPY.
 HE'S AN ACCESSORY TO A RAPE
 OF CHILDREN AND THAT IS A FELONY
 AND A SERIOUS ONE AT THAT.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN AN
 ACCESSORY?
 HE'S GOT A WEIRD RELIGIOUS CULT
 WHERE HE THINKS IT IS OKAY TO
 MARY UNDERAGE GIRLS BUT HE
 DIDN'T DO IT.
 WHY WOULD THE GUY WHO DID IT --
 HE SHOULD BE THE ONE DOING LIFE.
 I'M NOT DEFENDING UNDERAGE
 MARRIAGE.
 AT ALL.
 I JUST DON'T THINK IT IS THE
 SAME THING EXACTLY AS PULLING A
 CHILD FROM A BUS STOP AND SEXUAL
 ASSAULTING A CHILD.
 THE RAPIST MADE A LIFE LONG
 COMMITMENT TO TAKE CARE OF THE
 PERSON.
 LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT.
 BE HONEST ABOUT THE
 DISTINCTION BETWEEN RAPING A
 CHILD ONCE AND THEN FORCIBLY
 MAINTAINING YOUR CONTROL OVER
 THEM TO RAPE THEM AGAIN.
 CARLSON WENT TO TWITTER AND DID
 NOT APOLOGIZE SAYING MEDIA
 MATTERS CAUGHT ME SAYING
 SOMETHING ON A RADIO SHOW MORE
 THAN A DECADE AGO AND WITH THE
 USUAL RITUAL CONTRITION.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE GROUP THAT
 UNCOVERED THAT OF MEDIA MATTERS
 OF AMERICA AND YOU HAVE NEW
 AUDIO YOU JUST PUBLISHED THIS
 EVENING.
 YES.
 WHERE SHOULD WE START.
 THERE IS ONE CLIP IN WHICH HE
 USED A HOMOPHOBIC SLUR.
 I THINK THAT WE HAVE THAT WHICH
 YOU'VE JUST PUBLISHED.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 TUCK, DO YOU LIKE COMING ON
 WITH US.
 I LIKE YOU.
 I'M NOT TRYING TO [ BLEEP ] BUT
 I LIKE YOU.
 WELL I LIKE YOU TOO.
 AND I MEAN THAT AND YOU SAY THAT
 IN A NON -[ BLEEP ] BY I MEAN
 IT IN A [ BLEEP ] WAY.
 WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THE
 CLIPS WAS NOT JUST THE FACT THAT
 THEY'RE SO CONSISTENT WITH THE
 THINGS THAT HE SAYS NOW, BUT THE
 COMFORT IN WHICH HE SAYS IT.
 IS IT -IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
 SEEING THE REAL TUCKER CARLSON
 AND HOW PRIVATE HE IS AND LIVES
 BEHIND A DEEP VENEER AND I FEEL
 LIKE THAT'S THE REAL TUCKER AND
 THAT STRUCK ME, THE CASUALNESS
 TO IT FEELS THAT IS NOT THE ONLY
 TIME HE SAID THAT.
 LET ME JUST SAY, THAT MY
 POSITION ON THIS IS LIKE -THE
 MORE INFORMATION THE BETTER AND
 PEOPLE SHOULD HEAR AND TUCKER
 COULD DEFEND HIMSELF AND OWN THE
 THINGS HE SAYS.
 LIKE FOR INSTANCE, I HATE THE
 WAR -I'M NOT DEFENDING THE WAR
 IN ANY WAY BUT JUST HAVE ZERO
 SYMPATHY FOR THEM AS A CULTURE
 MEANING IRAQIS WHERE PEOPLE
 DON'T USE TOILET PAPER OR FORKS.
 THIS IS HIM IN 2008.
 THIS IS AFTER HUNDREDS OF
 THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS HAVE BEEN
 KILLED.
 IF I DIDN'T LIKE CANADA I
 WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT WORTH
 INVADING.
 I MEAN, IRAQ IS A CRAPPI PLACE
 FILLED WITH SEMI LITERAL MONKEYS
 AND ISN'T WORTH INNOVATING.
 THESE ARE HIS VIEWS AND THEY
 SHINE THROUGH.
 AND THERE WAS A POINT WHERE
 HE FACT -A FANTASIZED ABOUT A
 PRESIDENT THAT PROMISED TO RAD
 KATE -ERADICATE MUSLIM.
 HOW MUCH A CANDIDATE WOULD
 CATCH FIRE SAYING I'M SICK OF
 P.C. CULTURE, I'M JUST GOING TO
 KILL MUSLIMS.
 AND IF YOU TIE THAT WITH HIS
 PROGRAMMING TODAY AND WHY YOU
 SEE A WINKING AND NODDING BEFORE
 HIS SHOW EVEN LAUNCHED, WE FOUND
 HIS NEW PRODUCER GOESING INTO
 THE CHAT ROOM AND ANNOUNCING
 THEIR THE -THE PROGRAM WAS
 THERE AND INVITING IDEAS AND
 THERE IS A SEGMENT THAT IS A TOP
 STORY ON THE CHAINS OR ONE OF
 THE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE EASEL
 VATING IT -EASEL VATING IT AND
 GIVING IT AIR TIME.
 THIS IS THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE,
 THIS IS SAID 12 OR 13 YEARS AGO
 DURING HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THIS
 NETWORK, NOT FOX NEWS.
 CORRECT.
 AND THIS WAS SAID A LONG TIME
 AGO AND YOU'RE DIGGING THIS UP
 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE HIM ANY
 WAY?
 THAT IS -I UNDERSTAND WHY
 THAT IS THE CASE.
 IF THAT WAS THE CASE, WE JUST
 WANTED TO BOMBARD WITH
 EVERYTHING, I WOULD HAVE TAKEN
 THE HUNDRED PLUS HOURS THAT WE
 LISTENED TO AND PLAYED A LOT OF
 CLIPS BECAUSE HE SAID A LOT OF
 THINGS THAT ARE OBJECTIONABLE.
 HE SAID STUFF YOU CHOSE NOT
 TO PUBLISH.
 TONS OF IT.
 WE DID IT PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
 THAT.
 I'M NOT BEING A NICE GUY AND
 GIVE HIM A FAVOR BECAUSE THE
 ARGUMENT FOR PULLING THIS OUT
 NOW IS, ONE, BECAUSE OF HIS
 RELATIONSHIP TO THE PRESIDENT
 AND THE CONSUMPTION, TWO THAT I
 THINK IT GIVES CONTEXT ANDIN
 SIGHT -INSIGHT INTO WHAT HE
 DOES NIGHTLY ON THE PROGRAM AND
 TO THE END THEY ENRICH THAT
 UNDERSTANDING IT IS WORTHWHILE
 SO WE FOCUS ON THINGS HE SAID
 REPEATEDLY AND ECHO HIS
 PROGRAMMING TODAY AND THAT MAKES
 IT MUCH MORE RELEVANT.
 THERE IS A RIV ABOUT BARACK
 OBAMA -MICHELLE OBAMA ACTING
 LIKE A, QUOTE, SISTER,
 EXCESSIVELY BLACK IN THE
 ESTIMATION OF THE CO-HOST AND
 TUCKER CARL SORN.
 I THINK HE USED THE
 CHARACTERIZATION GHETTO.
 AND THE IDEA THAT BARACK
 OBAMA WOULD STILL BE A STATE
 SENATOR IF HE WERE WHITE WHICH
 IS ONE THING THAT WAS SAID AT A
 CERTAIN POINT.
 SO THE RACIAL TY AND RAILING
 AGAINST THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK
 CAUCUS AND POLITICAL
 CORRECTNESS.
 THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS
 EXISTS TO BLAME THE WHITE MAN
 FOR EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE
 KNOWS IT IS TRUE.
 THAT IS THE KIND OF THING SAID
 ON HIS PROGRAM.
 THIS IS NOT REVEALING ANYTHING
 ABOUT THE MAN'S CHARACTER VIEW.
 ALL OF THAT COULD BE FOUND AT
 MEDIA MATTERS WEBSITE AND LISTEN
 TO THE CLIPS AND GET THE FULL
 CONTEXT.
 AND JOINING ME KARINE
 JEAN-PIERRE AND WALEED SHAHID.
 WHEN THIS BROKE OVER THE
 WEEKEND, THIS IS NOT SURPRISING
 STUFF.
 ALTHOUGH THE QUOTES ABOUT THE
 IRAQIS MAKE ME VISCERALLY
 ENRAGED BECAUSE IT IS DISGUSTING
 BIGOTRY.
 DON JR. SAID I THINK THAT REAL
 DONALD TRUMP WAS THE ONE TO PAVE
 THE WAY IN RESPONSE TO THE
 REFUSAL TO APOLOGIZE, THE ACTS
 OF CONTRITION.
 HE TALKED IN TERMS JUST BECAUSE
 THE MOB WANTS TO TAKE THE LOSS,
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
 HE SHOWED CONSERVATIVES HOW TO
 FIGHT AND WIN.
 DO YOU THINK SOMETHING IS
 CHANGING IN THE DISCOURSE.
 NO, WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT
 FOX -LET ME ST. PAUL E STEP
 BACK.
 THERE IS SOMETHING THAT ANGELO
 SAID THAT RINGS TRUE TO ME WHICH
 IS WHEN YOU LISTEN OR HEAR
 TUCKER CARLSON ON THE RADIO
 SHOW, IT IS CASUAL.
 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE'S
 TOTALLY COMFORTABLE WITH.
 WHEN YOU SEE HIM ON TV, SOME
 PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT IS AN ACT.
 THAT IS NOT REALLY --
 IT IS NOT AN ACT.
 AND NOW YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT
 AN ACT.
 ANYBODY WHO THOUGHT IT WAS, IT
 ISN'T.
 HE SAYS THESE THINGS CASUALLY.
 AS IF HE'S COMFORTABLE.
 THESE ARE HIS VIEWS AND WHAT HE
 BELIEVES.
 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO FOX NEWS,
 THIS IS FOX NEWS.
 THEY REPEATEDLY HEAR HOSTS AND
 ANALYSTS AND REPORTERS ARE
 SAYING THINGS THAT ARE RACIST,
 HOMOPHOBIC AND MOSS --
 MISOGYNIST AND IT SELLS TO THE
 MARKETING TO THE PEOPLE
 WATCHING.
 BECAUSE IT IS PART OF A
 POLITICAL PROJECT.
 RIGHT.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
 THE POLITICAL PROJECT IS WHAT
 IS INTERESTING.
 OBVIOUSLY HATE CRIMES HAVE GONE
 UP FOR THE THIRD TIME THIS YEAR
 IN THE COUNTRY AND THE FBI
 REPORTED THAT AND ANTI-MUSLIM
 SENTIMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IN
 2017 IN TERMS OF HATE CRIMES WAS
 MATCHED THAT RIGHT AFTER 9/11 SO
 THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A -THIS
 DEHUMANIZING RHETORIC DOES
 IMPACT MUSLIMS ON A REGULAR
 DAILY LIFE AND AS FOR THE
 MARRIAGE BETWEEN FOX NEWS AND
 THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT IS A
 COALITION OF WHITE NATIONALISM
 AND THE CORPORATE GREED AND IT
 MAKES ME SICK THAT THE
 FRAUDSTERS AT THE TOP HIGHEST
 LEVELS OF FOX NEWS ARE SITTING
 AT THE TOP OF AMERICA'S
 OLIGARCHY AND PEDALING OUT
 CONSPIRACY THEORIES BY MUSLIMS
 AND BLACK PEOPLE TO BE THE BLAME
 FOR COUNTRY'S PROMISE AND THEY
 BELIEVE IT AND MAKING MILLIONS
 OF DOLLARS OFF OF THIS.
 AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR, ONE
 OF THE KEY THINGS TO UNDERSTAND
 ABOUT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY IN
 THIS MOMENT AND THE REASON THIS
 TAPE -AND I THOUGHT I WAS GLAD
 THAT PIRRO SAID WHAT SHE SAID IN
 SO FAR AS SHE JUST SAID WHAT IS
 THE BELIEF OF MANY PEOPLE AT
 THAT NETWORK AND IN THE
 CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT AND IT IS
 THAT THIS WOMAN WITH THE HIJAB
 IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE
 CONSTITUTION.
 OWN YOUR VIEWS AND DON'T PRETEND
 OTHERWISE.
 BUT ONE THING ABOUT YOUR POINT,
 ALL OF THAT MASS OTH ANNIE IS
 NOT AN ACT.
 THEY SIT THERE GETTING THEIR
 BRAIN ROTTED BY IT.
 THAT IS THEIR BELIEF AND TRUE
 CORE.
 AND PIRRO DIDN'T AD LIB.
 IT WAS LOADED INTO THE
 PROMPTER.
 AND SOMEBODY WROTE THAT FOR
 HER AND PROBABLY A PRODUCER
 APPROVED THAT LANGUAGE.
 LOOK, THIS IS WHAT FOX -AND
 THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS BEFORE
 DONALD TRUMP.
 LET'S BE VERY, VERY CLEAR.
 ALL OF THE HATRED THEY SPEWED
 DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
 AND THIS IS JUST WHO THEY ARE.
 EVEN RUPERT MURDOCH BACK IN 2015
 WAS TWEETING THINGS THAT WERE
 ISLAMO PHOBIC AND DISGUSTING AND
 THEY PACKAGE THIS AND DO IT 24/7
 AND LIES AND HATE AND IT IS
 AWFUL AND DISGUSTING.
 THERE IS A VANGUARD PART OF
 IT TOO.
 THEY ARE APPEALING TO THE BASE
 BUT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE GREEN
 NEW DEAL, THIS JUST FULL OF -A
 ASSAULT.
 AND IT HAS [ INAUDIBLE ].
 THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE WHITE
 HOUSE AND THEY ARE INTERTWINED
 IS INDISTINGUISHABLE AND THERE
 IS ALSO A USEFUL PROPAGANDA ON
 THIS --
 TRUMP INTRODUCED BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS OF CUTS TO MEDICARE AND
 THEY ARE NOT COVERING THAT
 BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SEE THE
 IDEA OF THROUGH NEW BROWNING
 AMERICA AND THE AOC AND THE
 ILHAN OMAR OF THE WORLD ARE THE
 ONES THAT WANT TO -AT THE END
 OF THE DAY, THIS IS WHERE THE
 FOX NEWS EXECUTIVES COME INTO
 PLAY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE
 DAY THEY PEDDLING THESE
 CONSPIRACY THEORIES BECAUSE THEY
 DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO VOTE TO
 RAISE TAXES ON THEM TO MAKE SURE
 EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY HAS
 HEALTH CARE AND THAT IS WHAT IS
 SO SAD AND SICKENING BY FOX
 NEWS,ALITY THE END OF THE DAY
 THE REASON WE CAN'T HAVE NICE
 THINGS IN AMERICA IS BECAUSE OF
 THE PEOPLE IN FOX NEWS COLLUDING
 TO DESTROY THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF
 THE COUNTRY.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS
 OF AUSTRALIA AND ENGLAND AND
 U.S. AND THEY ARE A BASKET CASE
 WITH THIS RIGHT WING AND THAT IS
 WHERE RUPERT MURDOCH MADE HIS
 BONES IN ALL THREE PLACES.
 YOU WOULD SAY IT IS SHAMEFUL
 BUT THEY HAVE NO SHAME.
 THEY FEEL NO SHAME.
 BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID, IT IS
 THEIR CORE.
 THIS IS WHAT THEY BELIEVE.
 LOOK, AND THERE IS ALSO THIS
 BIZARRE RELATIONSHIP.
 THE SICK RELATIONSHIP LIKE
 DONALD TRUMP NEEDS FOX AND FOX
 NEEDS DONALD TRUMP.
 AND THE THING ABOUT, TOO, IS
 YES, IT IS A PROPAGANDA STATE TV
 FOX NEWS AND THE PROBLEM IS
 DONALD TRUMP'S ONLY GETTING HIS
 INFORMATION FROM FOX NEWS.
 HE LITERALLY -THAT IS
 LITERALLY HOW THE PRESIDENT
 LEARNS ON THE WORLD.
 IT IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THEY
 ARE USING WHAT THEY'RE DEALING.
 THEY ALL ARE.
 THERE IS NO DISTINGUISHING
 BETWEEN THE TWO AND THE
 PRESIDENT IS A CONSUMER AND AVID
 CONSUMER.
 HIS VIEW OF THE WORLD AS HE IS
 PROUD TO TELL YOU IS FORMED IN
 REALTIME BY THE INFORMATION THAT
 COMES INTO HIM FROM FOLKS WHO
 SAY THAT IRAQIS FOR INSTANCE ARE
 SEMI-LITERATE PRIMITIVE MONKEYS.
 THIS IS THE BELIEF ABOUT THE
 WORLD.
 THIS IS THE MAN MAKING --
 AND TUCKER CARLSON IS GOING
 TO BE THIS RISING INTELLECTUAL
 STAR OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TEN
 OR 15 YEARS AGO AND THAT TELLS
 YOU WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
 IS IN TERMS OF THEIR IDEAS OF
 FREE MARKET ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL
 CONSERVATISM, IT IS ALL A SCAM.
 IT IS NOT AN ACT.
 THEY BELIEVE WHAT THEY BELIEVE.
 WHICH IS THE IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY
 FROM THIS.
 KARINE JEAN-PIERRE AND WALEED
 SHAHID.
 AND NEXT THE MASSAGE PARLOR
 MAGNATE REPORTEDLY SELLING
 ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT.
 WHO IS CINDY YANG AND WHAT IN
 THE NAME OF GOD IS HAPPENING AT
 THE PRESIDENT'S GOLF RESORT
 NEXT.
 UNDERSTAND
            RESORT NEXT

 UNDERSTAND
    I was cured an those          doubts behind.
  I faced reminders of my hep C            every day.
       But in only 8 weeks          with MAVYRET,
           I was cured.
    Even hanging with friends
    I worried about my hep C.
       But in only 8 weeks          with MAVYRET,
           I was cured.
 <i>MAVYRET is the only 8-week cure</i>
  <i> for all common types of hep C.</i>
     <i> Before starting MAVYRET</i>
      <i> your doctor will test</i>    <i> if you've had hepatitis B</i>
        <i> which may flare up</i> <i>and cause serious liver problems</i>
   <i> during and after treatment.</i>
         <i> Tell your doctor</i>    <i> if you've had hepatitis B,</i>
  <i> a liver or kidney transplant,</i>
      <i> other liver problems,</i>
         <i> HIV-1, or other</i>       <i> medical conditions,</i>
    <i> and all medicines you take</i>
  <i> including herbal supplements.</i>
        <i> Don't take MAVYRET</i>         <i> with atazanavir</i>
  <i> or rifampin, or if you've had</i>     <i> certain liver problems.</i>
   <i> Common side effects include</i>
     <i> headache and tiredness.</i>
      With hep C behind me,          I feel free...
          ...fearless...
 ...and there's no looking back,
       because I am cured.
       <i> Talk to your doctor</i>          <i> about MAVYRET.</i>
 BY NOW YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN
 PHOTOS OF A CERTAIN REPUBLICAN
 DONOR WITH DONALD TRUMP.
 HER NAME IS CINDY YANG AND LAST
 WEEK THE "MIAMI-HERALD" REPORTED
 THAT SHE FOUNDED AND NO LONGER
 OWNS THE DAY SPA IN FLORIDA
 WHERE THE OWN OF THE NEW ENGLAND
 PATRIOTS FOOTBALL TEAM ROBERT
 KRAFT WAS ARRESTED FOR
 SOLICITING PROSTITUTION.
 AND THAT IN A REALLY BIZARRE
 TWIST, SHE HAD A TENDING A SUPER
 BOWL PARTY THIS YEAR WITH KRAFT
 AND DONALD TRUMP AT THE WEST
 PALM BEACH COUNTRY CLUB.
 YANG FACES NO CHARGES IN
 CONNECTION WITH THE KRAFT ARREST
 OR THE TRAFFICKING PROBE.
 BUT MORE PICTURES OF YANG
 SURFACED WITH NOTABLE
 REPUBLICANS AND NOW MOTHER JONES
 REPORTS THAT YANG MIGHT HAVE
 BEEN SELLING ACCESS TO THE
 PRESIDENT TO CHINESE EXECUTIVES
 AT MAR-A-LARGO.
 A REPORTER WHO HELPED BREAK THAT
 STORY, DAVID CORN AND MOTHER
 JONES JOINS ME NOW.
 SHE WASN'T AT THE PARTY WITH
 KRAFT HIMSELF, WHO WAS AT THE
 SUPER BOWL BUT THERE WITH DONALD
 TRUMP.
 AND THEN THERE IS ALL OF THE
 PHOTOS THAT PROLIFERATE OF HER
 WITH EVERYONE IN REPUBLICAN
 POLITICS.
 WHAT IS YOUR REPORTING SAY ABOUT
 WHAT HER LATEST GIG HAS BEEN?
 WELL, IN ADDITION TO OWNING
 CHAIN OF MASSAGE PARLORS, SHE
 HAD WHAT SHE CALLED AN
 INVESTMENT COMPANY WHICH WAS
 GEARED TOWARDS CHINESE CLIENTS.
 IT'S MAIN WEBSITE WAS IN CHINESE
 AND TALKED ABOUT GIVING ADVICE
 TO U.S. BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO
 INVEST IN CHINA BUT THE REAL
 THING IT SEEMED TO BE DOING WAS
 TELLING CHINESE EXECUTIVES THAT
 IF YOU COME TO THE UNITED
 STATES, I CAN GET YOU INTO TO
 SEE PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP CIRCLE.
 THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF OR TRUMP'S
 FAMILY MEMBERS AND HIS SISTER
 ELIZABETH TRUMP GROU AND ELAINE
 CHOW.
 THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY
 AND WILBUR ROSS AND THE WEBSITE
 IS FULL OF PICTURES OF HER
 PRESUMABLY CLIENTS HAVING
 MEETINGS WITH THESE PEOPLE AND
 YOU SAID IN MARA LAGO, BUT IF
 EVENTS IN WASHINGTON WITH
 CABINET MEMBERS AND IT SAID WE
 CAN ARRANGE FOR YOU WHITE HOUSE
 DINNERS AND CAPITOL HILL
 DINNERS.
 IT IS SELLING ACCESS TO THE
 CHINESE AND SHE HAS GIVEN OVER
 $50,000 -SHE AND HER FAMILY
 MEMBERS TO VARIOUS TRUMP
 POLITICAL GROUPS.
 SO SHE -IS SHE PAYING TO GET
 ACCESS?
 IT SMELLS LIKE PAY TO PLAY.
 AND THERE IS PICTURES OF ALSO
 CLIENTS OF HERS HAVING WHITE
 HOUSE MEETINGS AND SUBSTANTIVE
 MEETINGS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
 ABOUT ISSUES?
 WELL, WITH MEETING WITH
 ELAINE CHOW AND GOING TO AN
 EVENT WITH WILBUR ROSS.
 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT
 THESE MEETINGS.
 WERE THESE MEET AND GREET WHERE
 THEY PAID THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
 TO GET A PICTURE, THEY GO BACK
 TO CHINA AND SAY, LOOK WHO WE'RE
 BUDDIES WITH AND DO BUSINESS
 WITH US AND THEN WE REPORTED
 YESTERDAY AND I SHOULD SAY I'M
 DOING THESE STORIES WITH MY
 COLLEAGUES DAN FREEMAN AND DAN
 SHOWMAN THAT SHE HAS CONNECTIONS
 TO TWO GROUPS LINKED TO THE
 CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND THE
 COMMUNIST PARTY THERE.
 SO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT
 WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.
 IS SHE -PART OF ONE OF THE
 THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT
 THE SORT OF SWAMPINESS OF
 MAR-A-LARGO, ANYONE COULD KIND
 OF HIT UP THE PRESIDENT WITH
 THEIR FAVORITE IDEA NEXT TO THE
 OMELET BAR AND PLANT A BUG IN
 HIS EAR.
 WE HAVE THIS CRAZY -IN TERMS
 OF THE EFFICACY OF SELLING
 ACCESS TO THIS PRESIDENT IT IS
 NOT A CRAZY IDEA AND THERE WAS
 AN IDEA ABOUT SOME -DENTAL
 REIMBURSEMENT AND TRUMP IS LIKE,
 SEND IT ON TO THE V.A.
 LIKE YOU CAN GET PRETTY CLOSE TO
 THIS GUY IF YOU PONY UP TO BE IN
 THIS CIRCLE OF CRONIES.
 AND YOU CAN DO IT BY GETTING
 A MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB.
 AND WE DON'T HAVE -A LOT OF
 VETTING OF PEOPLE WHO GO THERE
 AND IT SEEMS YOU COULD PAY THIS
 WOMAN WHO OWNS THESE MASSAGE
 PARLORS AND WHO MAKES DONATIONS
 TO -THE SIZABLE DONATIONS TO
 THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND SHE
 SOMEHOW IS ABLE TO EXPLOIT THAT
 AND BRING YOU RIGHT INTO
 MAR-A-LARGO AND GET YOU A PHOTO
 WITH THE TRUMP KIDS, DONALD AND
 ERIC AND WITH TRUMP'S SISTER AND
 ON THE WEBSITE ITSELF IN
 CHINESE, SHE MARKETS, WE CAN GET
 YOU IN THERE ON THE NEXT NEW
 YEAR'S EVE PARTY AT MAR-A-LARGO,
 WE HAVE AN ELITE FORM GOING ON
 AT MAR-A-LAGO SO YOU COULD MEET
 FAMILY MEMBERS.
 IT IS VERY BRAZEN AND NOT SUBTLE
 BUT KATE ORRING TO CHINESE.
 WE KNOW OF ONE THAT MADE A TRIP
 THERE AND HAD A MEETING AND DID
 SO THROUGH HER SERVICES.
 I WANT TO BRING IN CAITLIN
 OSTROFF WHO BROKE THE STORY.
 WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT HOW
 THIS WOMAN HAS MANAGED TO BE SO


 REMARKABLIOMY -REMARKABLE
 OM NYPRESENT.
 AND SHE WAS THE FOUNDER TO
 THE MASSAGE PARLOR AND THEN
 HAVING AN INVESTMENT COMPANY AND
 DOING OTHER PRACTICES OUTSIDE OF
 BEING A BUSINESS OWNER.
 SO THE QUESTION IS, IN A SPAN OF
 A COUPLE OF YEARS HOW DID SHE GO
 FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL DONOR TO
 THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND TO THE
 REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO ALL OF
 A SUDDEN TAKING SELFIES WITH
 PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OTHER
 HIGH-RANKING REPUBLICAN
 OFFICIALS SO THAT IS NOT
 SOMETHING WE COMPLETELY KNOW THE
 ANSWER TO.
 THERE IS AMBIGUITIES TO HOW SHE
 GOT THE CONNECTIONS TO GET THERE
 BUT SLEAZE BEEN INCREASINGLY
 GIVING MONEY TO CANDIDATES IN
 THE LAST YEAR OR SO SO THAT IS
 THE QUESTION I THINK US AND
 MOTHER JONES AS WELL ARE SEEKING
 TO ANSWER, HOW DID SHE GO FROM
 THAT ZERO TO 100.
 FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND I'LL
 COME BACK TO YOU, DAVID.
 THE "MIAMI-HERALD" SUGGESTS AND
 THIS IS NOT THE BIGGEST PART OF
 THE STORY, SINCE THE ORIGINAL
 WOE FACTORS WHAT SHE FOUNDED THE
 SPA THAT BOB KRAFT WAS BUSTED AT
 AND AT A SUPER BOWL PARTY
 WATCHING THE PARTSZ -PATRIOTS
 AND YOUR REPORTING THAT THEY ARE
 OFFERING THE KIND OF SERVICES
 THEY'RE OFFERING TODAY.
 YES.
 AND SHE WAS NOT BROUGHT UP ON
 ANY CHARGES IN THE ARREST OF
 KRAFT.
 BUT THERE HAS BEEN PEOPLE WHO
 USED TO WORK THERE WHO ALERTED
 LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
 THAT DID NOT PRESS CHARGES.
 BUT THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS
 RAISED AS TO WHETHER ILLICIT
 ACTIVITIES AND SERVEISES WERE
 OFFERED AT HER PARLORS.
 A FORMER EMPLOYEE THAT HAD
 QUESTIONS ON COMMENTS ON YELP
 SAYING THAT THEY HAVE PEOPLE
 BEEN SENT THERE AND THEY'VE BEEN
 OFFERED SEX OR OTHER
 SEXUAL-RELATED SERVICES.
 SO THAT IS CERTAINLY WITHIN
 QUESTION BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN
 BROUGHT UP ON ANY CHARGES
 RELATED TO THAT.
 DAVID, THERE IS PROBABLY SOME
 SORT OF -AT THIS POINT, SOME
 PART OF THE INTELLIGENCE
 APPARATUS SCRABBLING TO NAIL
 DOWN WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS
 INDIVIDUAL GIVEN THE FACT SHE'S
 HANGING AROUND MAR-A-LARGO TO
 THE PRESIDENT AND SELLING ACCESS
 TO HIM.
 WE GO FROM SEX TO NATIONAL
 SECURITY IMPLICATIONS.
 IF SHE'S BRINGING IN CHINESE
 EXECUTIVES TO MEET PEOPLE IN HIS
 CIRCLE AND KNOWN TO THE CHINESE
 GOVERNMENT OR AUTHORITIES, YOU
 THINK THEY WOULD WANT TO PIGGY
 BACK ON THIS.
 WE KNOW THERE IS VERY LITTLE
 VETTING WHEN THE SESSIONS HAPPEN
 AT MAR-A-LARGO AND AS WE
 REPORTED YESTERDAY WE KNOW SHE
 WORKS WITH TWO GROUPS THAT ARE
 OUT THERE PROMOTING CHINA'S TOP
 FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES.
 INCLUDING THE REABSORPTION OF
 TAIWAN.
 SO THERE A LOT TO DIG INTO HERE.
 I HATE TO SAY THIS, CHRIS, BUT
 THIS IS ANOTHER CONGRESSIONAL
 INVESTIGATION.
 THERE ARE SO MANY ALREADY, IT IS
 LIKE AIRPLANES ON THE RUNWAY.
 YOU CAN'T GET THEM ALL UP INTO
 THE AIR BUT IF THIS HAPPENED
 UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,
 YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GOING ON
 RIGHT NOW?
 DAVID CORN, IT IS VERY GOOD.
 AND CAITLIN OSTROFF, GREAT
 REPORTING.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 JUST AHEAD, A SURPRISE
 DECISION IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL FIELD.
 AS SENATOR SHERROD BROWN OF OHIO
 ANNOUNCES HE WILL NOT RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 I'LL ASK HIM WHY HE DECIDED TO
 STAY OUT, NEXT.
 I'LL ASK HIM WHY HE DECIDED TO STAY OUT, NEXT

         That was awful.
   Why are you so good at this?
   Had a coach in high school.
   Really helped me up my game.
       I had a coach. Math.
               Ooh.
      So, why don't traders          have coaches?
       Who says they don't?
          Coach McAdoo!
   You know, at TD Ameritrade,
  we offer free access       to coaches
  and a full education      curriculum-
         just to help you       improve your skills.
        Boom! Mad skills.
      <i> Education to take your</i>    <i> trading to the next level.</i>
     <i> Only with TD Ameritrade.</i>
       SARAH'S LAST TUITION       PAYMENT, SENT OFF.
          FEELING GOOD?
             OH YEAH.
       NOW I'M READY TO       FOCUS ON MY PROJECT.

       THIS IS WHY WE PLAN.

           YOU NEVER CEASE           TO AMAZE ME, MAYA.
  SEE HOW INVESTING WITH A J.P.  MORGAN ADVISOR CAN HELP YOU.
 THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES CONSIDERING ENTERING
 THE DEMOCRATIC RACE INCLUDING
 JOE BIDEN STILL MULLING OVER HIS
 DECISION AND BETO O'ROURKE WHO
 WILL HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT SOON
 AND TODAY STACEY ABRAMS SAID
 THAT A 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RUN IS
 ON THE TABLE.
 I HEAR THAT AND I WONDER WHAT
 THE PERIOD OF CONTEMPLATION
 LOOKS LIKE AND HOW SOMEONE MAKES
 THE DECISION TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY DECIDES TO
 DO IT LIKE FOR INSTANCE SHERROD
 BROWN WHO TOURED THE COUNTRY AND
 THEN ANNOUNCED HE WOULD NOT RUN
 LAST WEEK.
 HOW DID HE MAKE THAT DECISION?
 WELL, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SHERROD
 BROWN OF OHIO JOINS ME NOW.
 SENATOR, I'M REALLY CURIOUS
 ABOUT THIS -WHAT GOES INTO THE
 CALCULATION, BECAUSE YOU
 CONSTANTLY HEAR REPORTS ABOUT
 PEOPLE, THEY ARE TALKING TO
 ADVISERS AND FUNDRAISERS AND
 TALKING TO PEOPLE.
 WHAT IS IN YOUR HEAD AND WHAT
 DID YOU COME TO BELIEVE THROUGH
 THE PROCESS THAT LED TO YOUR
 DECISION?
 WELL AS YOU KNOW, CHRIS, I
 HAVEN'T HAD A LIFE LONG DREAM TO
 BE PRESIDENT.
 I'VE KNOWN YOU A LONG TIME AND
 YOU'VE NEVER HEARD ME -NOBODY
 THAT I KNOW HAS HEARD ME TALK
 ABOUT AS SOMETHING I WANTED TO
 DO AT SOME POINT IN MY LIFE AND
 THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE IN NOVEMBER
 OR DECEMBER WHEN I SAW THAT
 JUST -I JUST THOUGHT DEMOCRATS
 WEREN'T TALKING TO WORKERS
 ENOUGH AND I DON'T THINK WE WIN
 IN THE SOUTH OR THE MOUNTAIN
 WEST OR THE MIDWEST IF WE DON'T
 TALK TO WORKERS BETTER AND
 LISTEN TO WORKERS BETTER AND
 WORKERS OF ALL RACES AND I
 ANNOUNCED ON THIS SHOW, ON THE
 CHRIS HAYES SHOW, A COUPLE OF
 MONTHS AGO OUR DIGNITY OF WORK
 TOUR AND I UNDERLINE LISTENING
 BECAUSE WE SPEND TIME IN EACH OF
 THE FOUR EARLY STATES, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, IOWA, AND SOUTH
 CAROLINA AND NEVADA LISTENING TO
 PEOPLE AND THIS WHOLE IDEA OF
 THE DIGNITY OF WORK, WE WANTED
 THIS TO BECOME THE NARRATIVE FOR
 OTHER CANDIDATES AND I CONSIDER
 IT A SELECT IN -CONSIDER IT A
 VICTORY.
 IF YOU LOVE FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU
 FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE
 IT WORK AND I'VE CHOSE TONE DO
 THAT IN THE SENATE.
 BUT WHY?
 I THINK I COULD HAVE A LOUD
 VOICE THERE.
 AT SOME POINT YOU WERE
 CONSIDERING NOT DOING THAT.
 THE QUESTION IS DO YOU DRAW UP A
 SPREADSHEET OR MAKES A PROS AND
 CONS LIST?
 WHAT IS THE THING THAT TIPS ONE
 OVER WHEN MAKING A MONUMENTAL
 DECISION.
 I THINK IT IS THE QUESTION OF
 WHATRY WILLING TO GO THROUGH,
 WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT YOUR
 FAMILY THROUGH.
 I THINK THAT -SORT OF THE
 JOYFUL WAY I TRY TO DO MY JOB IN
 THE SENATE, I DIDN'T FEEL THAT I
 COULD DO THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
 QUITE THE SAME WAY AND BE
 EFFECTIVE.
 AND SO THE DECISION WAS -I
 KNOW EVERYBODY GETS TO IT
 DIFFERENTLY.
 I THINK IT IS I DON'T LONG TO
 HAVE THIS HUGE DESIRE TO BE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 I LOVE MY JOB IN THE SENATE.
 I THINK I'M EFFECTIVE AND OUR
 DIGNITY OF WORK NARRATIVE
 BECAUSE WE STARTED ON THIS SHOW
 HAS BECOME A MUCH BIGGER THING
 THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.
 SO I -I JUST THINK I'M READY
 TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS IN THE
 SENATE.
 WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT, I
 WONDER, WAS THERE PRESSURE --
 YOU WON THIS RACE -YOU WERE
 JUST RE-ELECTED IN OHIO AND PART
 OF THE PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT YOU
 AS A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS
 RECORD TO BE A FAIRLY LIBERAL
 SENATE IF YOU LOOK AT VOTING
 RECORDS IN A CASE THAT HAS
 TRENDED CONSERVATIVE AND RED.
 AND YOU JUST GOT RE-ELECTED.
 YOU CLEARLY HAVE A CONNECTION
 WITH THE STATE AND ABLE TO
 MESSAGE YOUR POLITICS AND
 CONNECT TO VOTERS THERE.
 WERE YOU GET ANY PUSHBACK FROM
 CHUCK SCHUMER, IF YOU WOULD WIN
 THIS THING WE WOULD BE DOWN A
 SEAT IN OHIO AND WE WOULD HAVE A
 HARD TIME REPLACING BECAUSE THE
 GOVERNOR WOULD APPOINT YOUR
 SUCCESSOR.
 NO.
 I HEARD THAT FROM SOMEBODY.
 I WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT IT BY
 MEDIA BUT NOBODY SAID --
 INCLUDING PEOPLE IN OHIO AND
 SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP,
 NOBODY SAID YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
 PARTLY BECAUSE WE WOULD BE GLAD
 IN THIS TIME TO TRADE A SENATE
 SEED FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
 AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A
 RECOGNITION THAT IF I WERE THE
 NOMINEE, I WOULD HAVE PERHAPS
 THE BEST CHANCE TO BEAT TRUMP.
 BUT I THINK THAT IF THIS DIGNITY
 OF WORK THEME -I WANT
 PEOPLE -I WANT OUR CANDIDATES
 TO THINK ABOUT THE GENERAL
 ELECTION AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO
 WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION AND IF
 THEY START TALKING TO WORKERS,
 OF COURSE WE PLAYED A PRO -A
 PROGRESSIVE BASE AND AGAINST
 NAFTA AND THE BANKRUPTCY BILL
 AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF ISSUES AS A
 PROGRESSIVE BUT WE HAVE TO TALK
 TO WORKERS.
 IF WE DO THAT, I PREDICT WHOEVER
 RAISES HIS OR HER HAND ON
 JANUARY 20th, 20 -WHOEVER YEAR
 IT WOULD BE, 2021, THEY WILL
 TALK ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK
 IN HIS OR HER INAUGURAL SPEECH.
 SHARPEN THAT.
 YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY, LOOK,
 DEMOCRATS NEED TO BE THINKING
 ABOUT A WAY TO TALK TO VOTERS
 BROADLY AND APPEAL BROADLY AND
 YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCE RUNNING IN
 OHIO WHERE THERE IS A BUNCH OF
 DIFFERENT CONSTITUENTS AND AS
 OPPOSED TO WHAT IS THE THING YOU
 ARE WORRIED THE FIELD HAS BEEN
 DOING OR IS GOING TO DO THAT
 YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE AN
 ANTIDOTE TO THAT IS BAD.
 I DON'T SAY IT IS BAD.
 IT MIGHT BECOME THAT.
 I DON'T THINK THAT OUR
 CANDIDATES ARE THINKING OF THE
 GENERAL ELECTION.
 I THINK THAT THERE IS A BIT OF
 ONE BIRD FLIES OFF THE TELEPHONE
 WIRE AND FIVE MORE BIRDS FLY OFF
 THE WIRE AND I JUST THINK THERE
 IS THAT.
 AND I JUST WANT CANDIDATES TO
 THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES AND MOVE
 THE COUNTRY FORWARD AND THINK
 ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION, EVEN
 THOUGH I HAVE A LIFETIME EFFORT
 FROM THE NRA, I GET GUN OWNERS
 VOTES IN ZANESVILLE AND
 NANCEVILLE AND LYME, OHIO,
 BECAUSE I TALK ABOUT KEEPING
 HEALTH CARE COSTS DOWN AND GOING
 AFTER THE DRUG COMPANIES AND HOW
 DO YOU SEND YOUR KID TO
 COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ZANE STATE
 OR ROAD STATE AND HOW DO YOU DO
 THAT AND IT REALLY IS -IT
 IS -THIS TOUR WE DID REALLY
 WAS A LISTENING TOUR.
 I WASN'T TRYING TO GET THE
 BIGGEST CROWD.
 I WAS LISTENING TO PEOPLE AND
 LEARNED STUFF.
 ONE WOMAN IN LACONIA, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, SAID YOU HAVE TO RUN
 A CHILDCARE FACILITY FOR YEARS,
 SAID YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
 CHILDCARE A PUBLIC GOOD AND WE
 INVEST IN TRANSPORTATION AND
 PUBLIC PARKS AND WE NEED TO
 INVEST IN CHILDCARE.
 AND THE IRONY OF CHILDCARE IS
 PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THE
 WORKERS THAT PROVIDE CAN'T MAKE
 A LIVING WAGE.
 SOMETHING IS WRONG THERE.
 THANK YOU SENATOR SHERROD
 BROWN.
 A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON.
 A WITNESS IN THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION IS CAUGHT IN AN
 APPARENT LIE ABOUT A 2016
 MEETING IN TRUMP TOWER AND THAT
 INTERVIEW AND THE MAN WHO
 EXPOSED HIM AHEAD.
 PLUS A SPECIAL FORENSIC
 INVESTIGATION IN THING ONE AND
 THING TWO, NEXT.
                 STIGATION IN THD THING TWO, NEXT.
        Hi, I'm Bob Harper,
        and I recently had          a heart attack.
        It changed my life.
        But I'm a survivor.
     After my heart attack, my    doctor prescribed BRILINTA.
   It's for people who have been hospitalized for a heart attack.
      BRILINTA is taken with        a low-dose aspirin.
    No more than 100 milligrams
           as it affects     how well BRILINTA works.
   BRILINTA helps keep platelets      from sticking together
    and forming a clot.
   In a clinical study,
  BRILINTA worked better       than Plavix.
  BRILINTA reduced the chance of  having another heart attack...
       ...or dying from one.
    <i> Don't stop taking BRILINTA</i> <i>without talking to your doctor,</i>
    <i> since stopping it too soon</i>       <i> increases your risk</i>
     <i> of clots in your stent,</i>      <i> heart attack, stroke,</i>
         <i> and even death.</i>
   <i> BRILINTA may cause bruising</i>     <i> or bleeding more easily,</i>
           <i> or serious,</i>    <i> sometimes fatal bleeding.</i>
 <i>Don't take BRILINTA if you have</i>  <i> bleeding, like stomach ulcers,</i>
   <i> a history of bleeding in the</i> <i>brain, or severe liver problems.</i>
        <i> Slow heart rhythm</i>        <i> has been reported.</i>
 <i>Tell your doctor about bleeding</i>
   <i> new or unexpected shortness</i>            <i> of breath</i>
       <i> any planned surgery,</i>   <i> and all medicines you take.</i>
        If you recently had          a heart attack,
    ask your doctor if BRILINTA         is right for you.
    My heart is worth BRILINTA.
 If you can't afford your       medication,
 AstraZeneca may be able to help.
    How many people love you         unconditionally?
  WhilIt would mean the worldider      ad     to them,
      <i> and they will love you</i>             <i> forever.</i>
 THING ONE TONIGHT, THE TIM APPLE MOMENT JUST WON'T GO AWAY
 FOR DONALD TRUMP.
 AND THAT IS BECAUSE HE WILL NOT
 LET IT GO.
 IN CASE YOU'RE OUT OF THE
 COUNTRY, LET US REFRESH YOUR
 MEMORY ABOUT THE MOMENT WITH TIM
 COOK, THE CEO OF APPLE.
 WE HAVE SO MANY COMPANIES
 COMING IN.
 PEOPLE LIKE TIM, YOU'RE
 EXPANDING ALL OVER AND DOING
 THINGS THAT I REALLY WANTED TO
 DO RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.
 I USED TO SAY, TIM, YOU GOT TO
 START DOING IT OVER HERE AND YOU
 REALLY HAVE.
 YOU'VE REALLY PUT A BIG
 INVESTMENT IN OUR COUNTRY.
 WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH TIM
 APPLE.
 OH, YES, TIM APPLE.
 THIS IS THE THING TRUMP HAS BEEN
 KNOWN TO DO.
 EVERYONE WAS IN HIS -MAYBE
 BECAUSE EVERYONE IN HIS FAMILY
 IS NAMED FOR THE COMPANY THEY
 WORK FOR.
 LAST MARCH HE APPEARED WITH THE
 CEO OF LOCKHEED MARTIN MARILYN
 HOUSTON.
 MARILYN LOCKHEED, THE LEADING
 WOMAN'S BUSINESS EXECUTIVE IN
 THIS COUNTRY ACCORDING TO MANY.
 HER NAME IS NOT MARILYN
 LOCKHEED, SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE
 LAST NAME OF THE COMPANY SHE
 RUNS, THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT
 WORKS.
 BUT THE COVERAGE OF TIM APPLE
 HAS GOTTEN UNDER TRUMP'S SKIN.
 AT MAR-A-LAGO ON FRIDAY NIGHT
 WITH NO CAMERAS PRESENT HE
 EXPLAINED TO A GROUP OF DONORS
 WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT THEY
 DESCRIBED AS ONE OF TRUMP'S
 WEIRDEST LIES EVER.
 THAT IS THING TWO IN 60 SECONDS.

       <i> -Driverless cars...</i>     -All ground personnel...
       <i> ...or trips to Mars.</i>
              <i> $4.95.</i>
         <i> Delivery drones</i>
      <i> or the latest phones.</i>
              <i> $4.95.</i>
    <i> No matter what you trade,</i>           <i> at Fidelity</i>
    <i> it's just $4.95 per online</i>        <i> U.S. equity trade.</i>
 SO AFTER DONALD TRUMP CALLED
 TIM COOK TIM APPLE AND EVERYBODY
 HAS A CHUCKLE OVER IT THE
 PRESIDENT TOLD A GROUP OF DONORS
 AT MAR-A-LAGO THIS WEEKEND, IT
 NEVER HAPPENED.
 AXIOS REPORTED THAT TRUMP TOLD
 THE DONORS THAT HE SAID TIM COOK
 APPLE REALLY FAST AND THE COOK
 PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS SOFT,
 BUT ALL YOU HEARD FROM THE FAKE
 NEWS HE SAID WAS TIM APPLE.
 WELL, THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
 IT IS POSSIBLE THIS LIE WORKED
 ON THE AUDIENCE AT TRUMP'S HOUSE
 OF FANCY GOLF AND OMELETS, SO
 JUST TO BE SURE, THING ONE AND
 THING TWO HAS DONE A FORENSIC
 ANALYSIS OF THE TAPE.
 ENHANCE.
 WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH
 TIM APPLE.


 YEAH, HE SAID TIM APPLE.
 SO THE LIE WAS SO BLATANT THAT
 HE CAME UP WITH A NEWS STORY AT
 A RECENT ROUND TABLE MEETING OF
 BUSINESS EXECUTIVE AND LONG
 AFTER FORMALLY INTRODUCING TIM
 COOK OF APPLE AND I REFERRED TO
 HIM AS TIM APPLE AS AN EASY WAY
 TO SAVE TIME IN WORDS.
 HOW IS HE STILL WRITING ABOUT
 THIS?
 WHAT IS -THIS IS WHY WE
 ELECTED HIM.
 TO SAVE TIME IN WORDS.
 AND NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAVED
 SO MANY WORDS.
 YOU KNOW, I'M TOTALLY OFF
 SCRIPT.
 RIGHT?
 DARLING IS THE WIND BLOWING
 TODAY.
 I WOULD LIKE TO WATCH
 TELEVISION.
 HE ASKED RUSSIA TO GO GET THE
 E-MAILS.
 HE'S BAD.
 HE'S A BAD, BAD -HE'S A BAD,
 BAD GUY.
 HEY, DON, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 HOW DONNIE, I LOVE YOU DONNIE.
 WHITE HAIR?
 SEE, I DON'T HAVE WHITE HAIR.
 RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA,
 RUSSIA --
           RUSSIA, RUSSIA -
         ete job
       <i> from any one else.</i>
       <i> Why accept it from</i>       <i> your allergy pills?</i>
   <i> Flonase Sensimist relieves</i>   <i> all your worst symptoms,</i>
   <i> including nasal congestion,</i>
     <i> which most pills don't.</i>
   <i> And all from a gentle mist</i>
      <i> you can barely feel.</i>
      <i> Flonase Sensimist.</i>
 ONE OF THE STRANGER PLOT TWISTS IS THE RETURN OF ERIK
 PRINCE, THE BROTHER OF BETSY
 DeVOS AND FOUNDER OF THE
 MERCENARY COMPANY ONCE CALLED
 BLACK WATER.
 AFTER THE INVOLVEMENT IN
 KILLINGS OF IRAQI CIVILIANS
 BROUGHT PUBLIC SCRUTINY, PRINCE
 REBRANDED THE COMPANY UNDER
 DIFFERENT NAMES AND SOLD IT OFF
 RELOCATED TO THE UNITED ARAB
 EMIRATES AND BEGAN FRONTIER
 SERVICES GROUP WHICH MARKETED
 SECURITY SERVICES TO FOREIGN
 STATES.
 THEN IN 2016 HE POPS UP HANGING
 AROUND TRUMP WORLD.
 DURING THE TRANSITION AFTER
 TRUMP WAS ELECTED, PRINCE WAS
 PART OF AN EFFORT TO SET UP A
 MEETING, MEETING THAT ACTUALLY
 HAPPENED WITH THE A RUSSIAN FUND
 MANAGER IN THE SEYCHELLES WHICH
 HE TESTIFIED ABOUT THE MEETING
 WAS UNCLEAR AND THERE WAS A
 STRANGE MEETING DURING THE
 CAMPAIGN AT TRUMP TOWER THAT
 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN
 ABOUT.
 AS THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED
 THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE
 ELECTION, DONALD TRUMP JR. MET
 WITH A GULF STATE EMISSARY WHO
 WAS OFFERING TO HELP DONALD
 TRUMP WIN THE ELECTION.
 ERIK PRINCE, THE PRIVATE
 SECURITY CONTRACTOR AND FORMER
 HEAD OF BLACK WATER ARRANGED THE
 MEETING THAT TOOK PLACE AUGUST
 3rd, 2016 IN TRUMP TOWER.
 APPARENTLY PRINCE DIDN'T TELL
 THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE ABOUT
 THAT MEETING IN TRUMP TOWER
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND ASKED
 ABOUT HIS OMISSION BY MEHDI
 HASAN ON AL JAZEERA SHOW HEAD TO
 HEAD.
 IN NOVEMBER OF 2017 YOU TOLD
 CONGRESS UNDER OATH THAT YOU
 PLAYED NO OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL
 ROLE IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BUT
 WHAT YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM IS ON
 AUGUST OF 2016 YOU WERE AT TRUMP
 TOWER WITH DON JR., AND STEVE
 MILLER THEN A CAMPAIGN ADVISER,
 GEORGE NADER WHO IS A BACK
 CHANNEL TO THE SAUDIS AND
 EMIRATES AND A CONVICTED
 PEDOPHILE AND JOEL ZEMMEL A
 SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT, HOW COME
 YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT MEETING
 TO CONGRESS GIVEN IT IS SO
 RELEVANT TO THEIR INVESTIGATION.
 I DID, AS PART OF THE
 INVESTIGATION, I CERTAINLY
 DISCLOSED --
 NOT IN THE
 TRUMP TOWER.
 THEY SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU WHAT
 CONTACTS YOU HAD AND YOU DIDN'T
 ANSWER THAT.
 I DON'T BELIEVE I WAS ASKED
 THAT QUESTION.
 YOU WERE ASKED ANY
 COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CAMPAIGN
 AND YOU SAID APART FROM WRITING
 PAPERS AND PUTTING UP YARD
 SIGNS, YOU SAID NO.
 I HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT TO THE
 CONVERSATION HERE.
 SURE, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN -I
 THINK I WAS AT TRUMP
 HEADQUARTERS OR THE CAMPAIGN
 HEADQUARTERS.
 AUGUST 3rd, 2016, USABLE, DON
 JUNIOR.
 WE WERE THERE TO TALK ABOUT
 IRAN POLICY.
 DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S
 IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE.
 I DID.
 YOU DIDN'T.
 WE JUST WENT THROUGH THE
 TESTIMONY.
 THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE TRUMP
 TOWER IN AUGUST 2016, THERE IS
 NOT.
 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY GOT THE
 TRANSCRIPT WRONG.
 THEY GOT THE TRANSCRIPT
 WRONG.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I REMEMBER --
 THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR YOU
 BECAUSE WE KNOW ROBERT MUELLER
 HAS GOT A LOT OF GUYS FOR LYING
 TO THE AUTHORITIES AND NOT
 TELLING THE WHOLE TRUTH.
 IS THAT A PROBLEM NOW IF YOU
 ACCIDENTLY DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT
 COULD COME BACK AND HAUNT YOU?
 I FULLY COOPERATED AND
 HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ANYBODY IN
 MORE THAN NINE MONTHS.
 HOUSE INTEL CHAIR ADAM SCHIFF
 RESPONDS TO THAT AND I'LL TALK
 WITH HASSAN HIMSELF AFTER THE
 BREAK.
 DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
                   MSELF AFTER T BREAK.
 DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
        They're America's  biopharmaceutical researchers.
   Pursuing life-changing cures
    in a country that fosters            innovation
 Here, they find breakthroughs...
    Like a way to fight cancer
    by arming a patient's own            T-cells...
   Because it's not just about     the next breakthrough...
  It's all the ones after that.
   Flight number 417 is being...
  <i> You should be mad at airports.</i>
           Excuse me,        where is gate 87?
     <i> You should be mad at</i>    <i> non-seasoned travelers.</i>
          And they took       my toothpaste away.
 <i>And you should be mad at people</i>   <i> who take unnecessary risks.</i>
      How dare you, he's my     emotional support snake.
       <i> But you're not mad,</i>
    <i> because you have E*TRADE,</i>
 <i>whose tech helps you understand</i>
  <i> the risk and reward potential</i>
       <i> on an options trade</i>
      It's a paste. It's not         liquid or a gel.
     <i> and even explore what-if</i>            <i> scenarios.</i>
         Where's gate 87?
          <i> Don't get mad.</i>         I have a vision        correction number,
    But I'm more than a number.
      When I'm not teaching,
      I'm taking steep grades        and tight corners.
   My Essilor lenses offer more      than vision correction
       with three innovative           technologies
     For my ultimate in vision

 I THINK I WAS AT TRUMP HEADQUARTERS OR THE CAMPAIGN
 HEADQUARTERS.
 TRUMP TOWER, AUGUST 3rd,

 YOU, AN ISRAELI DUDE, BACK
 CHANNEL TO THE SAUDIS, DONE
 JUNIOR.
 THERE TO TALK ABOUT IRAN
 POLICY.
 YOU WERE THERE TO TALK ABOUT
 IRAN POLICY?
 UH-HUH.
 ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO
 DISCLOSE UNDER OATH?
 I DID.
 THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE
 TRUMP TOWER MEETING 2016.
 WHY NOT?
 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY GOT THE
 TRANSCRIPT WRONG.
 ERIK PRINCE IS SUGGESTING HE
 DIDN'T LIE TO CONGRESS AND ADAM
 SCHIFF SIGNIFICANT --
 SUGGEST
 OTHERWISE.
 BOB MUELLER HAS THAT
 TESTIMONY ALREADY.
 AND BOB MUELLER WILL HAVE TO
 MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER
 THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF
 DELIBERATE FALSEHOOD.
 JOINING ME IS MEHDI HASAN.
 GOOD INTERVIEW.
 GETTING LOTS OF KUDOS, VERY RARE
 TO FIND SOMEONE THAT CAUGHT AS
 ERIK PRINCE WAS.
 HOW DID YOU NOTICE THAT
 OMISSION?
 I HAVE A GREAT TEAM OF
 PRODUCERS AND RESEARCHERS WHO
 WENT THROUGH EVERY SINGLE PAGE
 OF THAT.
 I WISH I COULD SAY I WENT
 THROUGH EVERY PAGE OF THE HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
 TESTIMONY, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S
 SOMETHING WE WANTED TO TALK TO
 HIM ABOUT.
 HE HADN'T BEEN PRESSED ABOUT HIS
 ROLE IN THE MEETINGS BOTH IN THE
 SEYCHELLES.
 WE WANTED TO GET HIM IN THE
 RECORD TALKING PUBLICLY ABOUT IT
 BECAUSE HE'S NOT COMFORTABLE
 TALKING ABOUT IT.
 YOU SAW HIS BODY LANGUAGE.
 WHAT IS ABSURD HE HAD ALL OF
 THIS TIME TO THINK ABOUT A
 DEFENSE AND CAME UP WITH THEY
 GOT THE TRANSCRIPT WRONG.
 COME ON.
 WHAT'S ALSO STRIKING IS JUST
 HOW WEIRD THIS MEETING IS.
 SIT BACK FOR A SECOND.
 THAT'S WHAT I WAS REALLY GLAD --
 IT'S AUGUST.
 TRUMP IS A NOMINEE.
 YOU'RE MEETING WITH THE
 CANDIDATE'S SON AT TRUMP TOWER
 WITH THIS VERY SKETCHY DUDE
 GEORGE NATER WHO IS A BECOME
 CHANNEL AND BEEN CONVICTED OF
 CHILD MOLESTATION WITH THIS
 ISRAELI SORT OF SOCIAL MEDIA
 GURU DUDE.
 WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT
 MEETING WAS ALL ABOUT?
 WHAT IS INTERESTING IS I
 DIDN'T GET AROUND TO ASKING HIM.
 HE VOLUNTEERED THAT IT WAS ABOUT
 IRAN POLICY THINKING THAT THAT
 WOULD BE SOME SORT OF GOOD
 ANSWER.
 THAT MAKES EVERYTHING MUCH WORSE
 FOR HIM BECAUSE THAT'S A PRETTY
 CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUE.
 WHY IS STEVEN MILLER ASK DONALD
 TRUMP JUNIOR WERE EXPERTS ON THE
 MIDDLE EAST NATIONAL SECUITY
 HAVING A PRIVATE MEETING WITH
 THE SAUDI GOVERNMENTS, GEORGE

 NATR AND THIS EXPERT THAT RUNS
 THIS IF I RECALL AND ERIK PRINCE
 A FORMER COMPANY GUY.
 IT'S A WEIRD GROUP OF PEOPLE
 TALKING ABOUT IRAN AND WE KNOW
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
 VERY, VERY HAWKISH ON IRAN.
 WE KNOW THE SAUDIS HAVE WANTED A
 CONFLICT WITH IRAN FOR A LONG
 TIME AND HERE IS WHAT IS
 INTERESTING, WE TALK ABOUT
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA AS IF THAT
 WAS THE ONLY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
 THAT WANTED TO SEE TRUMP ELECTED
 AND GOT INVOLVED.
 WE NOW THE GULF COUNTIES LIKE
 SAUDI ARABIA AND NETANYAHU WERE
 KEEN TO SEE A DONALD TRUMP
 PRESIDENT.
 THAT'S WHY THE MUELLER INVEST

  -INVESTIGATION IS
 INTERESTING.
 THIS MEETING IS A CLASSIC
 EXAMPLE OF THAT.
 WHY IS AN COMING TO THE TRUMP
 TOWER.
 NATR BROUGHT A PLAN USING
 PRIVATE CONTRACTORS, WHICH IS
 PRINCE'S SPECIAL.
 THERE IS A NEXUS.
 YOU HAVE THIS MEETING AND AFTER
 THE TRANSITION YOU HAVE A NEXUS
 BECAUSE HE IS INVOLVED IN THIS
 CRAZY MEETING SET UP IN THE
 SEYCHELLES THAT HAS THE SECURITY
 DUDE FOR THE RUSSIAN HEDGE FUND
 GUY.
 HE'S NOT JUST A HEDGE FUND
 GUY BUT THE HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN
 DIRECT INVESTMENT AUTHORITY VERY
 CLOSE TO PUTIN AND LEAKED
 E-MAILS REFERRED AS THE
 MESSENGER TO PRESIDENT PUTIN AND
 I ASK ERIK PRINCE WHY DID YOU GO
 TO THIS MEETING IN THE
 SEYCHELLES?
 HE SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, I
 HAD A BEER WITH HIM.
 YOU FLEW HALF WAY AROUND THE
 WORLD WITH A CLOSE ALLY OF
 VLADIMIR PUTIN TO DRINK A BEER?
 REALLY?
 COME ON.
 THESE LIES ARE ABSURD.
 THERE ARE MANY INDICATIONS
 THAT MEETING, SO THERE IS THE
 AUGUST 3rd MEETING.
 NINE DAYS BEFORE THE
 INAUGU
 INAUGURATION.
 THE GEORGE NATER FIGURE.
 AND A CONVICTED PEDOPHILE.
 REMEMBER, TRUMP SURROUNDS
 HIMSELF WITH THE BEST PEOPLE.
 GEORGE NATER, ERIK PRINCE,
 THE SEYCHELLES MEETING.
 THERE IS LOTS OF EVIDENCE
 FOREIGN INFLUENCE WASN'T
 ROOTING, THERE IS A WEIRD TRY
 ANGULATION WHO ARE ALL WORKING
 VARIOUS DIFFERENT ANGLES.
 YES, FLYNN AND KUSHNER MEET
 WITH KISLYAK AND FLYNN WANTS TO
 GO TO THE SEYCHELLES OR WHEREVER
 IT IS AND HE'S TOLD YOU'RE TOO
 HIGH PROFILE.
 THAT'S WHY PRINCE IS SEEN AS THE
 BACK CHANNEL.
 PRINCE DENIES THIS AND SAYS I
 WENT FOR THE BEER BECAUSE YOU
