EXPOSED HIM AHEAD. PLUS A SPECIAL FORENSIC PLUS A SPECIAL FORENSIC INVESTIGATION IN THING ONE AND INVESTIGATION IN THING ONE AND THING TWO, NEXT. STIGATION IN THD THING TWO, NEXT. Hi, I'm Bob Harper, and I recently had a heart attack. It changed my life. But I'm a survivor. After my heart attack, my doctor prescribed BRILINTA. It's for people who have been hospitalized for a heart attack. BRILINTA is taken with a low-dose aspirin. No more than 100 milligrams as it affects how well BRILINTA works. BRILINTA helps keep platelets from sticking together and forming a clot. In a clinical study, BRILINTA worked better than Plavix. BRILINTA reduced the chance of having another heart attack... ...or dying from one. <i> Don't stop taking BRILINTA</i> <i>without talking to your doctor,</i> <i> since stopping it too soon</i> <i> increases your risk</i> <i> of clots in your stent,</i> <i> heart attack, stroke,</i> <i> and even death.</i> <i> BRILINTA may cause bruising</i> <i> or bleeding more easily,</i> <i> or serious,</i> <i> sometimes fatal bleeding.</i> <i>Don't take BRILINTA if you have</i> <i> bleeding, like stomach ulcers,</i> <i> a history of bleeding in the</i> <i>brain, or severe liver problems.</i> <i> Slow heart rhythm</i> <i> has been reported.</i> <i>Tell your doctor about bleeding</i> <i> new or unexpected shortness</i> <i> of breath</i> <i> any planned surgery,</i> <i> and all medicines you take.</i> If you recently had a heart attack, ask your doctor if BRILINTA is right for you. My heart is worth BRILINTA. If you can't afford your medication, AstraZeneca may be able to help. 
- How many people love you unconditionally? WhilIt would mean the worldider ad to them, <i> and they will love you</i> <i> forever.</i>
