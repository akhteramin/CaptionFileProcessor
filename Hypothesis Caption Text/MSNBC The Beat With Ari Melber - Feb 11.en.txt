 THAT IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  WILL BE BACK TOMORROW WITH
 MORE "MTP DAILY."
 "THE BEAT WITH ARI MELBER" START
 S RIGHT NOW.
 A LOT OF STORIES ON "THE
 BEAT" TONIGHT.
 NANCY PELOSI MAKING THE NEWS,
 DECLARING HER STANDARD TONIGHT
 FOR WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO
 IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 SHE SAYS, QUOTE, THIS IS NE.
 I'M GOING TO BE JOINED LIVE BY
 ONE OF HER TOP LIEUTENANTS ON
 THAT UNFOLDING STORY FROM THE
 HILL.
 LATER, AN INSIDER SPEAKS OUT
 ON THE STORMY DANIELS HUSH MONEY
 PAYMENTS AND CORROBORATING PARTS
 OF MICHAEL COHEN'S ALLEGATIONS
 AGAINST TRUMP.
 ALSO, MORE NEWS ON THE
 CAMPAIGN FROM ELIZABETH WARREN,
 INCLUDING SOME OF THE NEWS SHE
 BROKE RIGHT HERE ON THIS SHOW ON
 FRIDAY.
 BUT WE BEGIN WITH BOB
 MUELLER GRINDING DOWN TWO FORMER
 TRUMP AIDES.
 THIS IS A PIVOTAL WEEK IN THE
 MUELLER PROBE.
 YOU'VE GOT ONE FEDERAL JUDGE WHO
 WILL ISSUE RULINGSHAT WILL
 DEFINE THE FATE AND POSSIBLY THE
 FREEDOM OF BOTH ROGER STONE AND
 PAUL MANAFORT, TWO FORMER TRUMP
 AIDES WHO'VE ALSO WORKED
 TOGETHER FOR DECADES.
 AND IT'S THROUGH THEIR WORK ON
 BEHALF OF DONALD TRUMP THAT BOTH
 MEN ARE NOW IN POSITION.
 THEY BOTH AWAIT RULINGS FROM AMY
 BERMAN JACKSON.
 SHE IS KNOWN AS A PRETTY TOUGH
 FEDERAL JUDGE.
 SHE IS THE ONE WHO FIRST CRACKED
 DOWN ON MANAFORT, PUTTING HIM IN
 JAIL OBVIOUSLY BEFORE HIS TRIAL.
 OBVISLY A TOUGHER TACK THAN
 THE OTHER FEDERAL JUDGE THAT
 GAVE HIM A LENIENT SENTENCE LATE
 LASTEEK FOR SEPARATE CRIMES.
 ALSO, AT ANY MOMENT, RER
 STONE'S FORMER LAWYERS WILL
 FORMALLY SUBMIT THEIR ARGUMENT
 TO HER, TO JUDGE JACKSON,
 BASICALLY TRYING TO CONVINCE HER
 THAT ROGER STONE DIDN'T REALLY
 VIOLATE HER GAG ORDER.
 HE IS SOMETHING OF AN INSTAGRAM
 BAND DID, AS YOU MAY KNOW, AND
 HE HAD THE RECENT POSTS WHICH
 APPEARED TO VIOLATE THE GAG
 ORDER.
 SHE COULD JAIL HIM FOR THAT,
 ALSO THIS WEEK.
 AS SOON AS THAT FILING COMES IN,
 I CAN TELL YOU WE'LL REPORT IT
 OUT FOR YOU.
 WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS.
 THERE ARE ALSO DEVELOPMENTS
 KICKING UP IN THE MUELLER PROBE
 THIS WEEK.
 WEDNESDAY MANAFORT RECVE THAT
 SENTENCE IN THE D.C. CASE THAT
 COULD BE UP TO TEN SEPARATE
 YEARS IN PRISON.
 THEN YOU HAVE MUELLER AND
 MICHAEL FLYNN'S LAWYERS
 PROVIDING AN UPDATE THAT COULD
 DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE
 ARE READY FOR SENTENCING.
 THEN COMES THE STONE DAY
 THURSDAY WITH JUDGE JACKSON.
 IDAY TN WE'LL ALSO GET AN
 UPDATE OVER WHETHER MANAFORT'S
 DEPUTY RICK GATES CAN BE
 SENTENCED OR WHETHER MUELLER
 NEEDS MORE TIME WITH HIM AS
 WELL.
 SO THAT'S A LOT OF ACTION RIGHT
 INSIDE THE COURTROOM.
 THEN OUTSIDE OF IT, YOU HAVE
 PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY
 PRIVATY HAILING MANAFORT FOR
 NOT BEING A RAT OR A COWARD AND
 LIKENING HIM TO A, QUOTE,
 POLITICAL PRISONER.
 ON ALL OF THE LEGALITIES, I WANT
 TO BEGIN WITH TWO FORMER FEDERAL
 PROSECUTORS, GLEN KIRSHNER AND
 PAUL HENDERSON.
 GOOD EVENING, JEFF.
 GOOD EVENING.
 THANKS FOR HAVING US.
 GLEN, WHAT DO YOU SEE IS
 IMPORTANT IN THIS BIG WEEK?
 YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MANAFORT
 SENTENCING, BECAUSE I THINK
 JUDGE ELLIS IS REALLY UNJUST AND
 UNJUSTIFIABLE SENTENCE OF
 MAFO SO FAR BELOW THE
 GUIDELINES WITH REALLY NO
 JUSTIFICATION FOR IT.
  DOES HARM NOT ONLY TO SORT OF
 THE MUELLER PROBE, BUT REALLY TO
 OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
 YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
 REASONS WHY A JUDGE CAN DEPART
 DOWNWARD, THAT IS GO BELOW WHAT
 IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BOTTOM OF
 THE POTENTIAL SENTENCE FOR
 MANAFORT OF 19 1/2 YEARS.
 AND THE JUDGE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED
 THAT NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS
 APPLIED.
 HE DIDN'T ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
 FOR HIS CRIMES AND HE DIDN'T
 SUBSTANTIALLY ASSIST THE
 GOVERNMENT IN OTHER
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 FACT, WE KNOW JUDGE JACKSON
 FOUND HE LIED TO THE MUELLER
 PRECUTORS ON, AMONG OTHER
 THINGS, ONE OF THE CENTRAL
 ISSUES TO THE MUELLER PROBE.
 SO FOR THEM TO HAVE JUDGE ELLIS
 ANNOUNCE THAT HE'S GOING FROM
 19 1/2 DOWN TO JUST 3 YEARS AND
 LEONARDO MONTHS I THINK REALLY
 DOES DAMAGE IN SO MANY WAYS TO
 THE SYSTEM.
 I THINK JUDGE JACKSON, WHO IS
 STRONG, INDEPENDENT, SMART, NO
 NONSENSE AND LAW AND ORDER IS
 GOING TO GET THE MANAFORT
 SENTENCE RIGHT.
 AND FOR THIS FORMER CAREER
 PROSECUTOR, THOSE THINGS STILL
 ER.
 SO, PAUL, I WONDER IF YOU
 COULD HANDICAP BOTH OF THESE BIG
 RULINGS THIS WEEK.
 SHE IS IN THE CENTER OF IT.
 AND ROGER STONE'S ARGUMENTS,
 WHICH WE'RE GOING REPORT IN
 DETAIL AS SOON AS WE GET THEM,
 THEY MAY BE A VY SIMPLE
 VERSION OF OUTKAST, I'M SORRY
 MISS JACKSON, ADMIT
 RESPONSIBILITY AND HOPE YOU
 DON'T GET JAILED.
 WHAT DOES MANAFORT SEE HAPPENING
 IN BOTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS?
 I THINK THE HAMMER IS GOING
 TO FALL AND IT'S GOING FALL VERY
 SEVERELY ON JACKSON.
 AND ALL OF THE OTHER REPORTS ARE
 ONLY GOING TO MAKE THAT SENTENCE
 EVEN WORSE FOR HIM.
 I THINK THE REAL ISSUE HERE, AND
 WHAT A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN
 TALKING ABOUT IS WHETHER OR NOT
 THESE SENTENCES ARE GOING TO BE
 CONCURRENT OR CONSECUTIVE.
 AND HERE THESE ARE SEPARATE
 CRIMES.
 I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS
 JUDGE IS MOVING IN THE DIRECTION
 THAT THE SENTENCES ARE NOT GOING
 TO BE CONCURRENT.
 YOU'RE TALKING WITH MANAFORT
 WHETHER SHE TAKES THE FOUR THAT
 HE'S GOT IN THIS OTHER LENIENT
 CASE AND ADDS TO THAT RATHER
 THAN COMBINING?
 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS.
 IS SHE GOING TO LET THEM RUN
 SIMPLY OR GOING TO RUN
 CONCURRENTLY.
 I THINK SHE IS GOING TO LET THEM
 SEPARATELY BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE
 DISPARITIES WE'VE SEEN THIS CASE
 AND THE HUGE DISPARITY WE'VE
 SEEN IN THE FIRST CASE WITH
 ELLIS.
 THIS IS BEFORE WE EVEN START
 TALKING ABOUT THE HUGE ECONOMIC
 AND RACE DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE
 IN FEDERAL SENTENCING.
 BUT IN THIS CASE IN PARTICULAR
 THAT IS SO FAR BELOW THE
 STANDARD AND THE GUIDELINE THAT
 WE'VE SEEN, I THINK JACKSON
 AFTER THIS 17 MONTHS OF DEALING
 WITH THIS CASE AND THE 500
 MOTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED
 BACK AND FORTH, IN ADDITION TO
 BREAKING HIS PLEA DEAL AND THE
 BAD BEHAVIOR BOTH FROM MANAFORT
 AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES, NOW IS
 THE TIME TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE
 TRANSGRESSIONS IN SENTENCING.
 ALL OF THOSE ARE AGGRAVATING
 FACTORS.
 DO YOU EXPECT JUDGE JACKSON
 HAT
 HAPPENED ELSEWHERE OR IS SHE
 GOING TO STAY LASER FOCUSED ON
 THESE CHARGES?
 I THINK SHE IS GOING TO STAY
 LASER FOCUSED IN THESE CHARGES,
 BUT SHE HAS TO TAKE IO ACCOUNT
 AND CONTEMPLATE SOME OF THE
 BIGGER PICTURE IN TERMS OF
 WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE
 MUELLER PROBE AND WHAT'S
 HAPPENING WITH HIS
 CO-CONSPIRATORS BECAUSE THAT'S
 ONE OF THE CHARGES THAT HE'S
 PLEAD TO IS HERE THE OBSTRUCTION
 OF JUSTICE AND ALSO THE
 CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE UNITED
 STATES.
 EACH OF THOSE CHARGES HE'S GOT
 TEN YEARS EACH FOR THOSE
 CHARGES.
 SO EVEN IF SHE BLENDS THEM
 TOGETHER AND JUST GIVES HIM THE
 TEN Y WHEN HE IS FACING
 ACTUALLY TWO DECADES, I THINK HE
 IS LIKELY TO LOOK AT A SENTENCE
 OF SOMETHING LIKE 14 YEARS.
 BUT EVEN IF ROLLS THEM IN
 AND CONTEMPLATES THE MITIGATING
 FACTORS WHICH I DON'T THINK SHE
 IS LIKELY TO DO BECAUSE OF HIS
 BEHAVIOR IN THIS CASE, I STILL
 THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND 14
 YEARS AND NOT THE 10 OR
 SOMETHING LOWER.
 AND, GLENN, ONE OF THE
 REASONS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS
 BEEN HAVING A BIG DEBATE OVER
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE INEQUITY SINCE
 THURSDAY NIGHT IS A GOOD THING
 THAT EXPOSES AAD THING.
 THE BAD THING ACCORDING TO MANY
 PEOPLE IS THE VERY CELEBRATE
 IMPORTANT INEQUITIES THAT WERE
 REVEALED IN JUDGE ELLIS'
 APPROACH.
 THE GOOD THING IS THAT WE DO
 HAVE TRANSPARENT FEDERAL COURTS
 WHICH MEANS IN OUR DEMOCRACY, IN
 OUR RULEF LAW, THE CITIZENRY
 LEARNS IN REALTIME NOT ONLY THE
 RESULT, BUT JUDGES HAVE TO SIT
 THERE AND EXPLAIN THEMSELVES,
 AND THAT THAT CAN HAVE A
 POSITIVE FACTOR HERE THAT CAN BE
 PART OF THE PROCESS OF
 ACCOTABILI.
 I MENTION THAT LOOKING FORWARD
 TO JUDGE JACKSON BECAUSE
 ALTHOUGH SHE HAS NOT BEEN
 CRITICIZED THE WAY JUDGE ELLIS
 HAS, THAT SAME TRANSPARENCY PUT
 HER ON RECORD AS SAYING NO MORE
 DO-OVERS FOR MR. STONE.
 AND WE ALL KNOW THA NOW.
 I WONDER HOW YOU THINK THAT
 FACTORS IN.
 I'M GOING READ YOU FROM WHAT SHE
 TOLD ROGER STONE THE LAST TIME
 OVER THE GAG ORDER.
 I GAVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE.
 THIS ISN'T BASEBALL.
 YOU DON'T GET A THIRD CHANCE.
 OU THINK HER SAYING THAT ON
 THE RECORD AND THE NATION
 KNOWING IT REALLY RAISES THE
 PRESSURE ON HER TO HAVE
 MEANINGFUL PUNISHMENT FOR HIM
 NOW?
 THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, ARI,
 CAUSE SHE DID PUT HERSELF SORT
 OF IN A BIT OF A BOX BY SAYING
 YOU DON'T GET A THIRD CHANCE.
 BUT LET ME TELL YOU, I THINK SHE
 IS GOING TO SEE STONE'S
 TRANSGRESSION HERE AS A BIT OF A
 FOUL TIP.
 I HAVE A FNG SHE IS NOT YET
 READY TO, AS WE SAY IN D.C.,
 STEP 'EM BACK, WHICH IS
 BASICALLY TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY
 AND DETAIN HIM PENDING TRIAL.
 WE SAW THE POST W HE SAID
 WHO FRAMED ROGER STONE, WHICH
 DOES SEEM TO VIOLATE THE
 MODIFIED GAG ORDER THAT SHE
 HANDED DOWN LAST TIME.
 WE DID H THAT I GUESS A
 RERELEASE OF A BOOK IS IN
 PROGRESS.
 I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT SHE'S
 GOING TO SEE THIS AS ENOUGH OF A
 DIRECT TRANSGRESSION OF HER
 MODIFIED GAG ORDER.
 SO LET ME ASK YOU.
 ISN'T THIS THE ISSUE WITH ROGER
 IS THAT HE PARSES AND PETTY FOGS
 HIS WA TO T BOUNDARY?
 I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE BOTH DEALT
 WITH CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE
 DONE LESS AND ALREADY BEEN HIT
 WITH MORE.
 ABSOLUTELY.

 AND HE DOES IT FOR THE
 ATTENTION.
 I THINK HE IS GETTING EXACTLY
 WHAT HE WANTS.
 BUT I HAVE A FEELING SHE IS
 GOING TO TREAT HIM LIKE THE
 TEENAGER THAT 'S BEHAVING
 LIKE.
 SHE IS GOING TO TAKE HIS PHONE.
 SHE IS GOING TO BAN HIM FROM
 SOCIAL MEDIA.
 SHE IS GOING TO SEND HIM TO HIS
 ROOM, PERHAPS PUT HIM ON HOME
 DETENTION WITH ELECTRONIC
 MONITORING VIA A GPS ANKLE
 BRACELET, AND I THINK SHE IS
 GOING TO CALL THIS ONE A FOUL
 ND GIVE HIM ONE MORE
 CHANCE, AND THEN IF HE VIOLATES,
 STEP HIM BACK.
 I COULD BE WRONG.
 SHE NO NONSENSE.
 SHAY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?
 I'VE ALREADY HAD ENOUGH WITH
 YOU.
 STAY WITH THE ME.
 I'M GOING TO BRING IN TO OUR
 CONVERSATION SHELBY HOL WHO
 IS NOT A REPORTER BUT SURE
 SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WITH
 REPORTERS ON THE STORY.
 WHICH IS FUN.
 I ENJOY IT.
 IF YOU WANT TO BE TOUGH ON
 MR. STONE, HE'S CLEARLY GONE UP
 TO THE LINE OVER AND OVER.
 IF YOU WANT TO BE BENIGN ABOUT
 IT, YOU SAY HE DIDN'T GO GIVE A
 SPEECH OR DO SOMETHING WE WOULD
 CALL THE TRADITIONAL VIOLATION.
 HE KEEPS USING INSTA STORIES AS
 A WAY TO TIPTOE AROUND AND MESS
 WITH IT.
 HE LIKES TO PLAY WITH FIRE.
 WHEN YOU TALK TOEGAL EXPERTS,
 YOU SAY THIS MAY NOT BE
 BLATANTLY OVER THE LINE BUT HE
 SURE AS HECK IS WALKING VERY
 CLOSE TO IT.
 THAT'S HIS PERSONALITY.
 I THINK WHAT'S TO INTERESTING
 ABOUT THIS WEEK IS JUDGE JACKSON
 WILL SENTENCE PAUL MANAFORT AND
 SEND A SIGNAL TO ROGER STONE.
 THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HER
 INTENTION, BUT WHATEVER COMES OF
 THAT SENTENCING WILL BE WATCHED
 VERY CLOSELY BY ROGER STONE
 BECAUSE HE'S COMING UP TO THE
 PELINE NEXT.
 I THINK WITH THE FOUR YEARS THAT
 MANAFO GOT LAST WEEK, A LOT OF
 PEOPLE WERE FRUSTRATED.
 A LOT OF MUELLER WATCHERS AND
 LEGAL EXPERTS WERE FRUSTRATED
 THAT THAT SENDS A SIGNAL TO
 OTHERS WRAPPED UP IN THE
 3450U8ER PROBE THAT MAYBE YOU
 DON'T HAVE TO COOPERATE.
 MAYBE YOU CAN LIE THE
 PROSECUTORS.
 MAYBE YOU CAN BREAK THE TERMS OF
 YOUR BAIL, DO ALL OF THESE BAD
 THINGS AND STILL KIND OF GET OFF
 THE HOOK.
 NOW FOUR YEARS IS NOT NOTHING.
 THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT JAIL
 SENTENCE.
 RIGHT.
 WHAT HE WAS FACING --
 IT'S A SLICE.
 IT'S A TINY SLICE BASED ON WHAT
 HE DID AND WHAT HE WAS UP FOR.
 RIGHT.
  AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS
 RUMOR MONGERING ABOUT WHETHER
 HIS LAWYER EMPHASIZING NO
 COLLUSION OTHER THAN LEGAL
 DENIALS IS AN APPEAL FOR A
 PARDON.
 HERE IS THE WHITE HOUSE
 RESPONDING AGAIN TO ALL OF THESE
 RUMORS TODAY.
 PAUL MANAFORT GOES FOR THE
 SECOND HALF OF HIS SENTENCING
 THIS WEEK.
 WHY HAVEN'T THE PRESIDENT RULED
 OUT A PARDON FOR PAUL MANAFORT?
HE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS
 POSITION ON THAT CLEAR, AND
 HE'LL MAKE A DECISION WHEN HE IS
 READY.
 THIS IS A FASCINATING -- THAT
 WAS A FASCINAING POINT THAT
 SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS MADE,
 BECAUSE EVEN PROSECUTORS NOTE
 THEY'D THOUG PAUL MANAFORT
 MIGHT BE ANGLING FOR A PARDON
 AND THEREFORE REFUSING TO
 COOPERATE FULLY.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY
 NONCOMMITTAL ON THIS ISSUE,
 WHICH MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE
 THINK HE WILL ISSUE A PARDON,
 AND SOME OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 SUPPORTERS WANT TO ISSUE A
 PARDON, BUT I JUST THINK YOU
 HAVE TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT
 THE HUGE RANGE OF CRIMES PAUL
 MANAFORT HAS EITHER PLEADED
 GUILTY TO OR BEEN CONVICTED OF,
 AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT AN
 AMERICA FIRST PRESIDENT COULD
 POTENTIALLY PARDON SOMEONE WHO
 CONSPIRED AGAINST THE UNITED
 STATES AND HAS YET TO EVEN
 APOLOGIZE TO AMERICANS FOR THAT.
 I THINK THAT'S A BIG POLITICAL
 CALCULATION IF THE PRESIDENT'S
 REALLY THINKING ABOUT A PARDON,
 WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORTH IT,
 WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORTH
 SPENDING THAT POLITICAL CAPAL
 REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
 GLENN, ON THAT POINT?
 YEAH, YOU KNOW, THIS IS MAN
 WHO STOLE FROM THE UNITED STATES
 BY FAILING TO PAY HIS TAXES,
 ENGAGED IN BANK FRAUD, ENGAGED
 IN CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE UNITED
 STATES BY ILLEGALLY LOBBYING,
 AND HE COMMITTED WITNESS
 TAMPERING.
 HERI TO URGE WITNESSES TO
 LIE SO HE IS DISRESPECTFUL OF
 THE COUNTRY.
 HE IS DISRESPECTFUL OF THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE, HANDY IS
 DISRESPECTFUL OF THE CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE SYSTEM.
 FOR THE PRESIDENT TO COME OUT
 AND SAY HE IS NOT A RAT, HE IS
 NOT A COWARD, HE IS A BRAVE MAN,
 THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE
 MESSAGE THAT A LAW-ABIDING
 PRESIDENT WOULD BE SENDING.
 AND PAUL, TAKE A LISTEN TO
 HOW PAUL MANAFORT SPOKE ABOUT
 ALL OF THIS BACK IN THE BETTER
 DAYS WHEN HE AND ROGER WERE
 TOASTING EACH OTHER FOR THEIR
 PROXIMITY TO DONALD TRUMP.
 ROGER RECOMMEND YOU FOR THE
 JOB?
 ROGER WAS ONE OF THE TWO OR
 THREE PEOPLE WHO STRONGLY
 RECOMMENDED ME, YES.
 EVEN AFTER ROGER STOPPED BEING
 THE PRINCIPLE POLITICAL ADVISER
 TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE CONTINUED
 TO BE AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL
 ADVISER AND IS TO THIS DAY.
 TAKE IT ALL TOGETHER FOR US,
 PAUL.
 YOU SEE THESE INDIVIDUALS, ONE A
 CONVICTED FELON WAITING FOR A
 POTENTIAL SENTENCE OF UP TO TEN
 MORE YEARS.
 THE OTHER LITERALLY PLEADING FOR
 HIS LIBERTY BEFORE HE GOES TO
 TRIAL.
 HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO OTHER
 LEGAL CASES YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED
 IN WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE FLYING SO
 HIGH,OW EVEN ON A BEST CASE
 SCENARIO, EVEN THE QUOTE/UNQUOTE
 LENIENT SENTENCE FACING REAL
 TOUGH TIMES?
 I THINK THAT LENIENCY IS OUT
 THE WINDOW.
 AND WHEN YOU H THESE PLEASE
 THAT THEY'RE MAKING NOW TO STAY
 OUT OF CUSTODY, I THINK IT'S
 GOING TO FALL ON DEAF EARS.
 I THINK THOSE STATEMENTS THAT WE
 HEARD ARE ALL GOING TO COME BACK
 AND BITE THEM.
 THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE USED AS
 STATEMENTS IN AGGRAVATION WHEN
 THEY'RE CONTINUE PL ALL O
 THE SENTENCES.
 I CAN ALREADY ANTICIPATE THE
 ARGUMENTS THAT PROSECUTORS ARE
 GOING TO BEAKING JUST TO GET
 THE SENTENCE, AND I BELIEVE THAT
 THIS SENTENCE IS GOING TO BE
 MUCH MORE HARSH THAN THE FIRST
 SENTENCEH ELLIS, AND I THINK
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME SERIOUS
 TIME, AND IT'S NOT GOING TO
 MATTER THAT THIS HAS BEEN A
 HIGH-FLYING POLITICAL INSIDER.
 WHAT'S GOING TO MATTER IS HIS
 BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL,
 HIS BEHAVIOR WITH THE PLEA
 BARGAINING, HIS BEHAVIOR WITH
 THE ASSOCIATION WITH ALL OF
 THESE OTHER FOLKS AROUND HIM
 THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN ALL OF THIS
 TERRIB HAVIOR.
 ALL OF THAT ADDS TO MORE YEARS.
 ALL OF THAT ADDS TO A NOT
 CONSIDERING A MITIGATING FACTOR
 TO KEEP SOMEONE OR RUN A
 SENTENCE THAT'S GOING TO BE
 CONCURRENT.
 WHAT'S GOING TO RESULT HERE IS A
 HEAVY STACK OF SENTENCES AND A
 HEAVY STACK OF YEARS I BELIEVE
 FOR MANAFORT.
 AND WE'RE GOING SEE THAT IN A
 MATTER OF DAYS.
 MY GUESS IS 14 YEARS OR MORE FOR
 THESE CHARGES.
 AND YOU -- MAYBE WE WILL SEE A
 CHANGE IN ATTITUDE.
 I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THAT'S
 REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE
 NOT HEARD AN APOLOGY.
 WE HAVE NOT HEARD MANAFORT COME
 FORWARD AND SAY THAT HE IS
 SORRY, THAT HE REGTS HIS
 CRIMES THAT HE'S COMMITTED, HIS
 CRIMES THAT HE HAS PLEAD TO.
 ALL OF THAT I THINK PUTS THE
 JUDGE IN A SITUATION WHERE SHE'S
 GOING TO SHOW HIM.
 RIGHT.
 THAT SHE IS IN CHARGE.
 RIGHT.
 SHE HAS NOT APPRECIATED HIS
 BEHAVIOR.
 RIGHT.
 HE HAS PLAYED GAIMT GAMES
 WITH HER.
 SO THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO
 HAPPEN.
 PAUL HENDERSON, GLENN
 KIRSHNER AND SHELBY HOLIDAY,

 BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT. SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI IS
 DECLARING SOMETHING OF A NEW
 STANDARD ON THE RECORD FOR WHAT
 IT WOULD TAKE TO IMPEACH
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 IN A BRAND-NEW INTERVIEW WITH
 "THE WASHINGTON POST" MAGAZINE,
 SPEAKER PELOSI SAYS THAT IT'S
 JUST NOT WORTH IT TO PURSUE
 IMPEACHMENT AT THIS TIME AND
 SAYS IN ORDER TO PURSUE IT, SHE
 WOULD NEED COMPELLING EVIDENCE
 AND A BIPARTISAN PROCESS.
 SHE ALSO PREFACED HER REMARKS BY
 SAYING THIS IS NEWS, SUGGESTING
 FOR WHATEVER REASON WANTS TO PUT
 A MARKER DOWN TONIGHT.
 AND HERE IS ONE OTHER REASON
 WHY.
 POLITICALLY, AS YOU MAY HAVE
 HEARD, THERE ARE GROWING CALLS
 FROM HER OWN CAUCUS, FROM HER
 OWN DEMOCRATIC MEMBER SAYING
 MAYBE IT IS TIME TO CONSIDER
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I RISE TODAY, MR. SPEAKER, TO
 CALL FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 OF AMERICA.
 I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE
 EVERYTHING THAT IT NEEDS TO
 BASICALLY IMPEACH HIM.
 YEAH.
 I BELIEVE THAT.
 BULLIES DON'T N, AND I SAID
 BABY, THEY DON'T.
 BECAUSE WE'RE GOING GO IN THERE
 AND WE'RE GOING IMPEACH THE
 [ BLEEP ].
 I'M NOW JOINED BY MEMBER OF
 SPEAKER PELOSI'S LEADERSHIP TEAM
 FROM THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC
 CAUCUS, AS WELL AS A MEMBER OF
 THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,
 RELEVANT FOR ALL THESE REASONS.
 CONGRESSMAN HAKEEM JEFFRIES,
 THANKS FOR JOINING ME TONIGHT.
 GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, ARI.
 THE BOTTOM LINE, THE SPEAKER
 TRYING TO MAKE NEWS HERE AND
 RAISE THE BAR AND THUS THE
 EXPECTATIONS ON WHAT IT WOULD
 TAKE TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP?
 I THINK WHAT THE SPEAKER IS
 DOING IS DRAWING A CLEAR
 DELINEATION IN TMSF WHAT THE
 HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IS ALL
 ABOUT.
 WE DIDN'T RUN A CAMPAIGN LAST
 YEAR AND SEIZE CONTROL OF THE
 HOUSE OF REPSENTATIVES BASED
 ON A DESIRE TO IMPEACH THE
 PRESIDENT.
 WE RAN A CAMPAIGN ON THE FOR THE
 PEOPLE AGENDA INDICATING WE WERE
 GOING TO FOCUS ON DRIVE DO YOU
 THINK THE HIGH COSTS OF
 LIFE-SAVING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS,
 INCREASE PAY FOR EVERY DAY
 AMERICAS, ENACT A INFRASTRUCTURE
 PLAN AND CLEAN UP CORRUPTION AND
 BRING OUR DEMOCRACY TO LIFE
 THAT'S WHAT WE RAN ON.
 THAT'S WHAT THE SPEAKER
 APPROPRIATELY WANTS TO KEEP OUR
 FOCUS ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD.
 THAT MAKES SENSE.
 I'M GOING PUSH YOU ON IT,
 THOUGH.
 I THINK EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS
 ABOUT SUPPORTING BASICALLY THE
 POLICY AGENDA TO TRY TO IMPROVE
 WORKING PEOPLE'S LIVES ACROSS
 AMERICA.
 NO DOUBT THERE IS A RECORD ON
 THAT.
 BUT WOULDN'T YOU AGREE WITH ME,
 REAL TALK, THAT THE MAJORITY OF
 PEOP I YOUR DISTRICT, THE
 MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS
 ALREADY THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP
 HAS ABUSED HIS POWER, AND THEY
 WERE EXPECTING, AT LEAST WAITING
 UNTIL MUELLER ISSUES HIS
 FINDINGS TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT
 THERE WOULD BE POTENTIAL
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS?
 THAT'S CORRECT.
 I DON'T THINK ANYTHING THE
 SPEAKER SAID IS INCONSISTENT
 WITH THAT NOTION THAT WE'RE
 GOING TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE
 APPROACH AS IT RELATES TO THE
 INVESTIGATION BEING CONDUCTED BY
 BOB MUELLER, AS WELL AS THE
 INVESTIGATION BEING CONDUCTED BY
 THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW
 YORK.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY,
 IMPEACHMENT IS THE ULTIMATE
 POLITICAL DEATH PENALTY.
 IT INCLUDED IN THE CONSTITUTION
 FOR EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.
 AS THE SPEAKER POINTED OUT, WE
 SHOULD ONLY PROCEED ABSENT A
 COMPELLING FINDING THAT ALLOWS
 US TO MAKE AN ABSOLE
 DETERMINATION TO GO DOWN THIS
 ROAD.
 CONGRESSMAN, SHE DIDN'T JUST
 REFER TO THE EVIDENCE WHICH IS
 WHAT YOU'RE CALLING WAIT AND
 SEE.
 SHE SAID AS PART OF THE STANDARD
 THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE,
 QUOTE/UNQUOTE, BIPARTISAN.
 AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
 LOOK AT THE CONDUCT OF THE
 REPUBLICANS IN THE TRUMP ERA,
 AND THEY SAY WHY WOULD ANYONE
 WITH SUBPOENA POWER RUNNING THE
 HOUSE WAIT ON THEM TO MAK THEIR
 OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT ABOUT
 WHAT MUELLER MAY OR MAY NOT
 FIND?
 WELL TWO, THINGS.
 WE'RE GOING CONTINUE OUR
 AGGRESSIVE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION AS
 IT RELATES TO BEING A CHECK AND
 BALANCE ON AN OUT-OF-CONTROL
 UTIVERANCH THAT IS OUR
 RESPONSIBILITY.
 WITH RESPECT TO IMPEACHMENT, AS
 YOU KNOW, LISTEN, THE HOUSE
 FUNDAMENTALLY IS THE GRAND JURY.
 THE SENATE IS THE ULTIMATE JURY.
 UH-HUH.
 IMPEACHMENT IS LIKE AN
 INDICTMENT, AND WE CAN INDICT IN
 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IF
 THE EVIDENCE IS COMPELLING
 ENOUGH TO MOVE FORWARD.
 BUT THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE
 PRESUMABLY OF THE PEOPLE WHO
 BELIEVE APPROPRIATELY THAT
 DONALD TRUMP HAS PRESIDED OVER
 CHAOS, CRISIS, CONFUSION, AND A
 CULTURE OF CORRUPTION IS TO
 REMOVE HIM.
 AND WHAT THE SPEAKER HAS MADE
 CLEAR IS TO GET TO REMOVAL, YOU
 WILL ND AT LEAST 20 REPUBLICAN
 SENATORS IN THE OTHER HOUSE OF
 CONGRESS.
 THAT'S REALITY.
 YOU'RE SPEAKING TO AN
 INTRICACY THAT YOU MAY KNOW OF
 BECAUSE YOU DEAL WITH HER DAILY
 THAT WASN'T QUITE IN HER
 STATEMENT, WHICH IS MAKING WAVES
 TONIGHT.
 ARE YOU SAYING THAT SHE'S
 BASICALLY LAYING OUT A POSITION
 THAT SHE'S NOT GOING TO GO NEWT
 AND GO IN WITH A BATTLE PLAN
 THAT IS ON AARTISAN BASIS IN
 THE HOUSE WITHOUT A LONGER TERM
 STRATEGY OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
 IN THE SENATE, AND YOU WOULD
 HAVE THE BUILD EITHER THROUGH
 THE EVENTS, THE EVIDENCE
 WHATEVER IS UNCOVERED ABOUT THE
 PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE
 SUPPORT FOR THAT BEING A
 POSSIBILITY IN THE SENATE,
 OTHERWISE IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO
 GETT STARTED AT ALL?
 WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD AN
 OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THAT
 DIRECTLY WITH SPEAKER PELOSI
 ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THOSE
 REMARKS BUT I CAN INTERPRET
 THEM.
 I'VE HEARD YOU GUYS ARE
 TIGHT.
 THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
 I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT
 THEM.
 WE'RE ALL DOWN WITH NDP.
 BUT ATTEND OF THE DAY, I DO KNOW
 THAT CHAIRMAN JERRY NADLER,
 SPEAKER PELOSI ON OTHER
 OCCASIONS, MYSELF AND OTHER
 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC
 LEADERSHIP HAVE MADE THE
 OBSERVATION THAT THERE IS A
 DISTINCTION BETWEEN IMPEACHMENT
 AND REMOVAL, AND THAT IN ORDER
 FOR US TO PROCEED, ULTIMATELY,
 IF THERE IS A CONCLUSION THAT
 THIS PRESIDENT HAS PRESIDED OVER
 A CULTF CRIMINALITY AND
 CORRUPTION IS TOTALLY OUT OF
 CONTROL SO THAT THE ULTIMATE
 POLITICAL DEATH PENALTY IS
 MERITED, YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN A
 BIPARTISAN WAY IF YOU'RE GOING
 GET TO REMOVAL.
 WE CAN INDICT IN THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES, BUT IN ORDER TO
 CONVICT, IT HAS TO BE DONE WITH
 DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND
 THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE.
 I AGREE WITH SPEAKER PELOSI THAT
 THAT IS THE REASONABLE WAY TO
 PROCEED.
 VERY INTERESTING, BECAUSE
 THIS IS MAKING WAVES, AND SHE'S
 OBVIOUSLY SPEAKING TO A
 CONSTITUENCY THAT'S GOT WHOLE
 BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VIEWS ON,
 AGAIN, ON WHAT YOU CALL THE
 DOCUNTED CORRUPTION OF THIS
 PARTICULAR PRESIDENT.
 CONGRESSMAN HAKEEM JEFFRIES FROM
 LEADERSHIP, THANKS FOR JOINING
 ME TONIGHT.
 THANK YOU, ARI.
 APPRECIATE IT, SIR.
 UP AHEAD, AOC MAKING WAVES
 OF HER OWN AT THE SOUTH BY
 SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE TALKING

 BUT FIRST, THE LAWYER WHO
 STUCK ON STORMY DANIELS' HUSH
 MONEY DEAL, WHO WAS ALL INVOLVED
 IN IT, WHO WASN'T SPEAKING,
 WELL, HE IS BREAKING HIS
 SILENCE.
 WE HAVE MORE ON THAT WHEN WE
 BACK IN 30.

 HERE IS THE HEADLINE. IT WAS POLITICAL.
 THAT IS WHAT THE FOR LAWYER
 FOR STORMY DANIELS AND KAREN
 McDOUGLE IS SAYING ABOUT THESE
 HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS THAT HE
 ORIGINALLY NEGOTIATED.
 YOU MAY REMEMBER THE NAME.
 KEITH DAVIDSON WAS THE LAWYER
 BEFORE MIKE MICHAEL AVENATTI, A
 SAYS IT WAS THE RELEASE OF THE
 NEW INFAMOUS "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD"
 TAPE THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING.
 THE "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE
 WAS THE MOTIVATING FACTOR IN
 THIS CASE ACTUALLY RESOLVING.
 IT DEFEATS THE ARGUMENT THAT
 THIS WAS DONE FOR PURELY
 PERSONAL REASON AND THAT THIS
 WAS IN FACT DONE FOR POLITICAL
 REASONS BECAUSE AFTER THE
 "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE, THAT
 SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD BE THE
 STRAW TT BROKE THE CAMEL'S
 BACK.
 YOU MIGHT SAY OF COURSE IT
 WAS POLITICAL OR WHO CARES, BUT
 THIS ALL MATTERS NOW BECAUSE IT
 GOES BACK TO THE CRIME THAT
 MICHAEL COHEN CONFESSED TO.
 DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO MOUNT
 A DEFENSE CLAIMING THAT THOSE
 PAYMENTS WERE PERSONAL AND NOT
 POLITICAL, MEANING YOU WOULDN'T
 GET IN TROUBLE WITH CAMPAIGN
 LAW.
 NOW COHEN'S GOING TO JAIL
 BECAE HE PLEAD GUILTY TO, YES,
 A CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION,
 AND THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE
 OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE WITH
 COHEN, DAVIDSON, ISN'T IN THE
 CLEAR EITHER.
 CONGRESS WANTS TO HEAR FROM HIM.
 HE IS NOW ON THAT NOW FAMOUS
 LIST O81 PEOPLE THAT THE HOUSE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS
 INVESTIGATING.
 HE IS ALSO FACING SEPARATE
 ALLEGATIONS THAT HE ORIGINALLY
 COLLUDED AGAINST HIS OWN CLIENTS
 WITH COHEN.
 THAT'S A CLAIM DENIES.
 WE'VE COVERED IT ON THE SHOW.
 BUT IN THIS NEW INTERVIEW, HE IS
 DISHING ON HOW FRIENDLY HE AND
 COHEN WERE.
 DAVIDSON SAYS COHEN CONFIDED IN
 HIM ABOUT BEING UPSET THAT HE
 DIDN'T EVEN GET, WAIT FOR IT, A
 ROLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHICH
 OF COURSES ALSO INTERESTING
 BECAUSE WHATEVER EVERYONE THINKS
 OF MICHAEL COHEN, THIS HAS COME
 UP IN WHAT EVERYONE THINKS ABOUT
 BEING 100% TRUTHFUL ABOUT.
 HE CONDED IN ME THAT HE WAS
 JUST BESIDE HIMSELF, AND IN HIS
 WORDS, HE SAID CAN YOU [ BLEEP ]
 EVEN BELIEVE IT.
 AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE, HE'S
 NOT TAKING ME T WASHINGTON.
 CAN YOU BELIEVE HIT?
 WELL, MANY PEOPLE SAY YEAH YOU
 WORK HARD FOR DONALD TRUMP, IT
 DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET
 RETURNED.
 THE HOUSE CENTRAL IS "ACCESS
 HOLLYWOOD" TAPE.
 A FORMER FOX REPORTER IS ALSO
 TRYING TO GET OUT OF AN NDA
 AFTER REPORTS THAT FOX KILLED
 THE STORY ON THAT BEFORE THE
 ELECTION BECAUSE RUPERT MURDOCH
 WAS TRYING TO PUT A THUMB ON THE
 SCALE AND GET TRUMP TO WIN,
 RELEASING A STATEMENT THAT
 QUOTE, THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT
 TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
 FOX NEWS HAS DENIED THIS.
 DAVIDSON WEIGHING IN SAYING THE
 FOX REPORTER CALLED HIM F
 COMMENT RIGHT AFTER THE "ACCESS
 HOLLYWOOD" TAPE CAME OUT WITH
 FACTUALLY SPECIFIC DETAILST
 3450IG9 HAVE INFORMED THAT STORY
 WHICH DIDN'T ORIGINALLY RUN.
 HERE WITH ME NOW EXCLUSIVELY IS
 THE LAWYER FOR THAT FORMER FOX
 REPORT, NANCY ERIKA SMITH, A
 LEADING CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER WHO
 ALSO REPRESENTED GRETCHEN
 CARLSON IN A SEXUAL HARASSMENT
 LAWSUIT AGAINST FORMER FOX NEWS
 CEO ROGER AILES.
 AND FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE
 SENATE WATERGATE COMMITTEE WHO
 KNOWS A TNG OR TWO ABOUT
 INVESTIGATING POLITICAL CRIMES.
 THANKS TO EACH OF YOU FOR BEING
 HERE.
 NANCY, BEFORE WE GET DEEP INTO
 THE DETAILS, WHAT DO YOU THINK
 MR. DAVIDSON, WHATEVER HIS
 CREDIBILITY, THE CORE OF WHAT
 HE'S SAYING, DOES THAT HELP THE
 CASE AGAINST TRUMP?
 BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE ANOTHER
 PERSON CORROBORATING THAT THIS
 WAS CAMPAIGN-RELATED.
 IT ABSOLUTELY DOES, AND THE
 TIMING DOES AS WELL.
 WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
 MID-OCTOBER, WEEKS BEFORE THE
 ELECTION, YOU'RE TALKINGBOUT
 SOMETHING THAT COULD CLEARLY
 AFFECT AN ELECTION.
 OBVIOUSLY TRUMP THOUGHT THAT,
 AND THERE ARE WITNESSES WHO
 SPOKE TO JANE MAYER AT "THE NEW
 YORKER"S WHO INDICATE THAT
 MURDOCH KNEW THAT AS WELL.
 THAT'S WHY THE STORY WAS KILLED
 ACCORDING TO JANE MAYER AT "THE
 NEW YORKER."
 ALTHOUGH THEY DENY THAT.
 THEY DENY IT, BUT THIS IS
 ALLY EASY.
 THIS IS SIMPLE.
 MAYBE CONGRESS SHOULD SUBPOENA
 MY CLIENT AND ALL OF HER
 RECORDS, AND THEN WE WILL SEE
 EXACTLY WHAT FOX NEWS HAD.
 HAVE YOU AND YOUR CLIENT BEEN
 CONTACTED BY SAY, HOUSE
 JUDICIARY OR OVERSIGHT?
 NOT YET.
 BUT SUB AENA WILL TRUMP AN
 NDA.
 SO YOU'RE MAKING A LITTLE BIT
 OF NEWS HERE, WHICH WHY WE LIKE
 EXCLUSIVE GUTS.
 YOU'RE SAYING THAT FORMER FOX
 NEWS REPORTER, WHICHSY DIANA
 FALZONE.
 UNTIL IT IS VALIDATED BY THE
 COURT.
 OR UNTIL SHE GETS A SUBPOENA.
 WHICH YOU'RE SAYING WOULD
 OVERRIDE IT ANYWAY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 SO YOU'RE SAYING IF WE JUST
 HAD A CONGRESSMAN EARLIER IN THE
 SHOW.
 IF ONE OF THESE CONGRESS PERSONS
 WANTED TO SUBPOENA YOUR CLIENT
 WITH THE POWER OF THE HOUSE,
 THAT WOULD YOU SAY DELIVER WHAT?
 WHAT VALUE WOULD THAT ADD?

 THAT WOULD ADD -- IT WOULD ADD
 TO THE INVESTIGATION OF WHETHER
 FOX IS REALLY A NEWS
 ORGANIZATION OR WHETHER IT IS A
 CAMPAIGN ARM OF DONALD TRUMP OR
 WHETHER JUST KILLING THE STORY
 WAS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN
 CONTRIBUTION WORTH WHAT?
 OBVIOUSLY THEY THOUGHT IT WAS
 WORTH SOMETHING IF IT HAPPENED.
 HE WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BY
 78,000 VOTES.
 WOULD8,000O-CALLED
 EVANGELICALS THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY
 ABOUT HIM IF THEY KNEW ABOUT AN
 AFFAIR AND A PAYOFF STORY WITH A
 PORN STAR?
 POSSIBLY.
 I ALMOST GET THE FEELING YOUR
 LIKE AN EFFECTIVE LAWYER WITH A
 LONG-TERM STRATEGY HERE.
 THANK YOU.
 DAVID, YOU KNOWR WAY
 AROUND THE CONGRESSIONAL
 INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS.
 NANCY KNOWS A LOT, BUT ALSO HAS
 A CLIENT HERE, SO SHE HAS AN
 AGENDA AND INTEREST.
 DO YOU FUNDAMENTALLY THINK IN
 YOUR INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS THAT
 THIS IS A PROPER A FRUITFUL
 AVENUE FOR THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS?
 WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO WHAT SHE
 JUST SAID AND THE STORY?
 WELL, ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT
 RT OFHE PICTURE, AND I THINK
 IT'S ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT PART
 OF THE PICTURE FOR THE SOUTHERN
 DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
 AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE
 ACTION IS GOING TO BE.
 FOR ONE REASON, AS A PROSECUTOR,
 I COULD GET INCOME TAX RETURNS.
 SO THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW
 YORK MAY BE SITTING THERE WITH
 TRUMP'S INCOME TAX RETURNS.
 AND WHAT'S GOING ON, WHEN TRUMP
 PAID COHEN TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR
 THE PAYMENTS TO STORMY DANIELS,
 HE LISTED THAT AS A RETAINER AND
 PRESUMABLY DEDUCTED THOSE
 PAYMENTS.
 THAT DEDUCTION --
 YOU START TALKING ABOUT TAX EN
 DEDUCTION.
 WELL, IT'S A SUBJECT THAT
 FLOORS A LOT OF PEOPLE.
 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD
 TRUMP, IT MAY BE PART OF HIS
 DOWNFALL BECAUSE HE DEDUCTED
 THOSE PAYMENT TO MICHAEL COHEN.
 BUT IS THIS LIKE -- ARE YOU
 BASICALLY IMAGINING AN AL CAPONE
 SITUATION WHERE AFTER EVERYTHING
 THAT'S HAPPENED, HE GETS IN
 TROUBLE FOR TAX DEDUCTIONS?
 PERHAPS.

 BECAUSE FOR ONE THING, TRUMP
 COULD PARDON HIMSELF, BUT HE
 COULDN'T PARDON HIMSELF FOR
 VIOLATING STATE LAW.
 AND THE INCOME TAX RETURNS THAT
 HE FILED ON BEHALF FOR THE STATE
 WOULD BE FALSE BECAUSE HE
 PRESUMABLY DEDUCTED THE PAYMENTS
 TO MICHAEL COHEN.
 WELL, DAVID, TAKE A LTEN TO
 THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE IS
 HANDLING THIS, DEFLECTING
 BASICALLY ON COHEN, A PROBLEM
 THAT WON'T SEEM TO GO AWAY.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 WHY DID THE PRESIDENT WRITE A
 CHECK TO MICHAEL COHEN FOR
 $35,000 IN AUGUST OF 2017?
 HE TESTIFIED ABOUT THIS.
 HE SPECIFICALLY ACCUSED THE
 PRESIDENT OF ENGAGING IN
 CONSPIRACY TO ENGAGE IN CAMPAIGN
 VIOLATION.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR
 THERE WASN'T A CAMPAIGN
 VIOLATION.
 DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE HUSH
 MONEY.
 THE STORY HAS CHANGED.
 AGAIN, I WOULD REFER YOU BACK
 TO THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS.
 DAVID, YOUR VIEW OF THEIR
 STRUGGLE TO EVEN EXPLAIN WHAT IS
 CORROBORATED, WHICH IS THESE
 PAYMENTS FOR, AGAIN, AN NDA THAT
 THEY LITERALLY SUEDRMY OVER
 WHICH WAS THEIR WAY OF
 CORROBORATING THEY PAID FOR IT.
 WELL, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
 WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
 BECAUSE THE PAYMENTS ARE
 DOCUMENTED NOW WITH CHECKS.
 I THINK THEY'RE DOING
 GOBBLEDYGOOK, AS IN WATERGATE
 WHERE HUSH MONEY WAS AN
 IMPORTANT PART OF THE PICTURE
 AND ULTIMATELY I THINK WAS THE
 DOWNFALL OF A PART OF THE
 COVER-UP, I THINK THESE PAYMENTS
 ARE GOING TO BE VERY, VERY
 IMPORTANT.
 INTERESTING.
 AND THAT'S INTERESTING COMING
 FROM YOUR WATERGATE EXPERIENCE
 AND SDNY.
 NANCY, I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE
 WE'RE CLEAR HERE BECAUSE THIS IS
 A DISPUTE.
 I WANT TO READ WHAT A FOX
 EXE SAYS ABOUT THIS, WHICH
 IS, QUOTE, DANIELS AND HER
 ASSOCIATES WERE ACTUALLY PLAYING
 A BIZARRE CAT AND MOUSE NEWS
 GAME WITH FOX AND OTHER NEWS
 TLETS, TRYING TO GET THEIR
 STORY OUT, WITHOUT FINGERPRINTS
 AND ULTIMATELY WITHOUT ENOUGH
 PROOF T PUBLISH.
 ISN'T THAT A FAIR DEFENSE FOR
 JOURNALISTIC OUTLETS WHO SAID
 THEY NEEDED TO BE SURE BEFORE
 THEY WENT WITH SOMETHING?
 JOURNALISTIC OUTLETS WOULDN'T
 HAVE TO KEEP THE STO UNDER AN
 NDA IF THEY WANTED THE STORY TO
 COME OUT.
 AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
 SHOULD NOT BE ABLE HIDE
 INFORMATION FROM THE AMERICAN
 PUBLIC WITH NDAs.
 SO YOU'RE SAYING IF THAT
 DEFENSE IS TRUE IT MIGHT BE
 VALID, AND YOUR FORMAL
 ENTINT SHEER NOT THAT THEY
 DON'T HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT TO
 DISCUSS, BUT THAT THEY'RE
 ACTUALLY TRYING TO PREVENT THE
 DISCUSSION OF THAT.
 ABSOLUTELY, THAT'S EXACTLY --
 THAT MAKES A GOOD POINT.
 AND I THINK THE POINT YOU MAKE
 ABOUT THE HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY
 INTERESTING.
 NANCY ERIKA SMITH AND DAVID
 DORIS SENN, THANKS TO BOTH OF
 YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 UP NEXT, MAKING WAVES ABOUT
 WHAT LIBERAL VOTER THINKS OFHE
 SOCIALIST AGENDA.
 AOC SOUNDING OFF.
 AND LATER COMEDY IN THE TRUMP
 ERA AND MORE WITH THE MAN BEHIND
 "SEINFELD."
 EXCUSE ME, I THINK YOU FORGOT

                  of life
    into our Subaru Forester.
      It's good to be back.
           It sure is.
    Over the years, we trusted    it to carry and protect
    the things that were most    important to us.
  We always knew we had a lot of  life ahead of us.
          Remember this?
  That's why we chose a car that  we knew would be there for us
         through it all.

     Do your asthma symptoms       ever hold you back?
     About 50% of people with          severe asthma
    have too many cells called   eosinophils in their lungs.
      Eosinophils are a key     cause of severe asthma.
  FASENRA is desned to tget     and remove these cells.
      FASENRA is an add-on     injection for people 12
       and up with asthma      driven by sinophils.
     FASENRA is not a rescue             medicine
           or for other     eosinophilic conditions.
    FASENRA is proven to help  prevent severe asthma attacks,
    improve breathing, and can     lower oral steroid use.
        FASENRA may cause       alrgic reactions.
    Get help right away if you      have swelling of your
   face, mouth, and tongue, or        trouble breathing.
      Don't stop your asthma            treatments
        unless your doctor          tells you to.
  Tell your doctor if you have a       parasitic infection
     or your asthma worsens.
   Headache and sore throat may             occur.
    Haven't you missed enough?
    Ask an asthma specialist          about FASENRA.
       If you can't afford        your medication,
         AstraZeneca may        be able to help.      My experience with USAA
        has been excellent.
      They really appreciate      thmilitary family
       and it really shows.
     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we wocall
    another insurance company,
      hey would say      “Oh we can't beat USAA”
     We're bber family.
     We're the Tenney's
         We're the Hayles,
 and we're USAA members for life.

 FOR A HUGE SHAKE-UP IN THE TECH SECTOR.
 IT'S BIG AND IT'S BOLD AND
 IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO
 ACHIEVE.
 COULD SHE REALLY FORCE THIS
 KIND OF BREAKUP?
 COULD SHE REALLY DO IT?
 YOU BET.
 WHAT'S THE ANSWER?
 THE ANSWER IS YES.
 YES.
 THAT WAS SENATOR ELIZABETH
 WAENIG HERE ON FRIDAY
 NIGHT.
 SHE'S GOT A SWEEPING PLAN THAT
 SHE WAS UNVEILING TO TRY TO
 BREAK UP THESE POPULAR TECH
 GIANTS LIKE GOOGLE AND AMAZON,
 AND NOW SHE IS TAKING HER
 MESSAGO SNTETHING OF A
 PROVERBIAL TECH LIONS DEN
 BECAUSE SHE WENT TO ONE OF THE
 LEADING TECH CONFERENCES IN THE
 NATION IN TEXAS, YOU MAY HAVE
 HEARD OF IT, SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST.
 AND SO DID FIVE OTHER DEMOCRATIC
 HOPEFULS IN 2020.
 LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT, MARA GAY,
 EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER FORE
 NEW YORK TIMES."
 NICE TO SEE YOU.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 THEY ALL GO DOWN THERE
 BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE NEW
 SCHOOL PLACES TO GATHER.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SENATOR
  BEING THE ONE WITH KIND
 OF THE TOUGHEST TECH AGENDA IN
 THIS TECH SPACE?
 I THINK IT'S A SMART PLAY FOR
 HER POLITICALLY.
 I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER
 OVER THESE TECH COMPANIES BEING
 UNREGULATED, AND I THINK THEY'VE
 BEEN MAKING THE ARGUMENT FOR A
 LONG TIME THEY'VE -- THEY'RE THE
 BIG INTERRUPTERS.
 THEY'RE KIND OF TRYING TO BE
 GOOD CITIZENS IN A WAY THAT MOST
 CORPORATIONS DON'T PORT TEND TO
 BE, REALLY.
 AND I THINK THEY'RE KIND OF
 ASKING FOR IT IN A SENSE.
 AND SO THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN
 THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER FROM
 THEIR LACK OF ACTION THAT THEY
 TOOK.
 FACEBOOK, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE
 2016 ELECTION DOWN TO AMAZON
 HAVING CITIES COMPETE.
 RIGHT.
 TO GIVE THEM, YOU KNOW, A
 CORPORATE GIVEAWAYS.
 AND PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO
 THINK OF MOST CORPORATIONS AS
 RED OR BLUE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 BUT BEFORE THESE -- WHA
 YOU'RE DEFINING AS THESE 2016
 SCANDALS, THE TECH SECTOR WAS
 CONSIDERED SOMEWHAT CLOSE TO THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WAS CONSIDERED
 SORT OF NEW SCHOOL.
 AMAZON WAS NOT CONSIRED EXXON,
 IT'S FAIR TO SAY.
 AS YOU POINT OUT, THAT MAY BE
 CHANGING.
 THIS IS HER IN RAPID-FIRE WHEN I
 ASKED HER IN A WORD TO DEFINE
 THESE COMPANIES AND A FEW OTHER
 THINGS.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 SURE.
 AMAZON.
 TOO BIG.
 GOOGLE.
 TOO BIG.
 FACEBOOK.
 TOO BIG.
 MARK ZUCKERBERG.
 TOO POWERFUL.
 FAVORITE MEMBER OF THE
 FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OF
 VERNORS?
 OH, JANET YELLEN.
 YOUR DREAM RUNNING MATE
 THROUGHOUT HISTORY, LIVE
 ORGANIZE DEAD, IF YOU COULD PICK
 A PERSON THAT WOULD RUN WITH
 YOU.
 TEDDY ROOSEVELT.
 AND SHE CITED TEDDY, WHO
 HAPPENS TO BE REPUBLICAN FOR
 TAKING ON THE BIG CORPORATIONS.
 THE TRUST BUSTER.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 HOW MUCH OF THIS COULD BE THE
 FAULT LINE OF THE DEMOCRA
 PRIMARY?
 LISTEN, IT'S A WARNING SHOT.
 I THINK ACTUALLY THAT THE REAL
 FAULT LINE OFHE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY IS GOING TO BE AND THE
 CENTRAL QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATIC
 VOTERS AND OTHER VOTERS IS GOING
 TO BE HOW THESE CANDIDATES DEAL
 WITH NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP BUT
 ALSO INCOME INEQUALITY.
 AND THE TECH SECTOR CERTAINLY
 PLAYS INTO THAT, AMAZON IN SOME
 WAY ABSOLUTELY.
 BUT I DON'T SEE THIS AS THE
 CENTRAL ISSUE NECESSARILY OF THE
 ELECTION.
 AND BEFORE I LET YOU GO,
 SPEAKER PELOSI SAYING VERY
 CLY WE'RE NOT ON OUR WAY TO
 IMPEACHING HIM.
 THE GRASSROOTS AND SOME OF THE
 2020 CANDIDATES SEEM TO BE
 STRIKING A DIFFERENT CHORD.
 LO, THE CASE FOR
 IMPEACHMENT SHOULD BE -- THE BAR
 FOR IMPEACHMENT, EXCUSE ME,
 SHOULD BE EXTREMELY HIGH.
 IT'S A DRASTIC MOVE.
 BUT I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE
 MICHAEL COHEN, THE PRESIDENT'S
 FORMER LAWYERMPLICATING THE
 PRESIDENT IN POTENTIALLY A DOZEN
 CRIMES, WE'VE CROSSDELINE THAT
 DEMANDS A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION,
 AND WE CAN WAIT FOR THE MUELLER
 REPORT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BUT
 I THINK -- I THINK, YOU KNOW,
 SPEAKER PELOSI IS GOING TO BE IN
 A TOUGH PLACE AND SHE IS TRYING
 TO GIVE HERSELF TIME, AND THAT'S
 JUST FINE.
 RIGHT.
 AS YOU SAY, I THINK WHAT SHE WAS
 SAYING AND CONGRESSMAN JEFFRIES
 IS ALLUDING TO THIS NIGHT THEY
 DON'T WANT TO BE MARCHED INTO IT
 BEFORE THEY EVEN FIND OUT WHAT
 MUELLER HAS.
 I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE,
 AND WE'VE INTERVIEWED THEM WHO
 SAY SHE HAS GONE TOO FAR IN
 BUYING TIME.
 IF THE PRESIDENTS GUILTY OF
 SYSTEM OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS
 BEEN ACCUSED OF DOING, THEN SOME
 OF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE
 IMPEHABLE OFFENSES.
 RIGHT.
 AND SO THE QUESTION THEN AS THEY
 PUT IT, DO THEY WAIT FOR THE
 SENATE AND SAY WE DON'T HAVE A
 CAUSE.
 THAT'S WHAT WAS JEFFREYS'
 ARGUMENT TONIGHT OR DO YOU HAVE
 AN OBLIGATION TO DEAL WITH IT.
 THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WILL
 KEEP ROLLING.

 ANK YOU TONIGHT.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

 DANGEROUS WORLD, MURDERERS,
 TERRORIST, EXTREMISTS AND WHAT
 THEY LAUGH AT.
 WE WILL EXPLORE COMEDY IN PLACES
 WHERE NOTHING THE FUNNY, IN
 PLACES WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG.
 BY KNOWING A COUNTRY'S COMEDY,
 YOU WILL  ITS PAST, PRESENT,
 AND FUTURE.
 THANKS FOR BEING HERE, LARRY.
 MY PLEASURE.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
 FOR HAVING ME.
 COMEDY AS A WINDOW INTO THE
 SOUL.
 YES.
 THAT'S SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE
 THE OR JUST YOUR PITCH TO
 NETFLIX?
 KIND OF SOMETHING I LEARNED.
 I CAME IN THINKING I WOULD MEET
 PEOPLE DOING WHAT THE DAILY SHOW
 DOES HERE.
 SATIRIING CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS
 AND TRYIN TO SURVIVE.
 THAT DOES EXIST IN GREAT NURMS

  -- NUMBERS AROUND THE WORLD.
 COMEDY ALSO HEALS.
 PEOPLE DYING AND BEING WOUNDED
 AND INJURED.
 FAMILIES BEING DESTROYED AND
 LAUGHTER BEING USED AS A TOOL
 FOR HEALING.
 BECAUSE SEINFELD WAS SO
 BELOVED.
 IT WAS ONE OF THE LAST SHOWS
 THAD REALLY THE WHOLE
 COUNTRY TUNING IN.
 ITS JOKES WERE SEEN AS ABOUT
 EVERY ONE SAID NOTHING.
 IT WAS MORE THAN THAT BUT ABOUT
 STUFF WE CAN ALL RELATE TO
 INCLUDING THE LITTLE STUFF.
 WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH AIRPLANE
 FOOD?
 I'M NOT IF NOT HOPELESSLY
 DERIVATIVE.
 YOU WORK WITH LARRY DAVID.
 YES.
 WE ARE ALL IN POLITICS
 GETTING READY TO SEE MORE LARRY
 DAVID BECAUSE BERNIE SANDERS IS
 BACK.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ICONIC
 IMPRESSION.
 PEOPLE LOVE ME.
 I HAVE MORE INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS
 THAT ANY CANDIDATE IN HISTORY
 AND I DON'T TAKE FROM
 MILLIONAIRES ANDBILLIONAIRES.
 WE KNOW.
 YOU SAY IT EVERY TIME YOU'RE ON
 TV.
 EVERYBODY KNOWS.
 DOES THAT COUNT AS AN
 IMPRESSION OR IS THAT JUST LARRY
 DAVID?
 I THINK LARRY DAVID IS SO
 UNIQUELY QUALIFIED FOR THAT
 IMPRESSION IT'S NOT MUCH OF A
 LEAP.
 BERNIE IS FROM THE SAME
 NEIGHBORHOOD AS WE ARE.
 WE GREW UP WITHUYS LIKE BERNIE
 SANDERS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
 D YOU EVER THINK ONE OF
 THEM WOULD GET THIS FAR IN
 POLITICS?
 I GREW UP IN TRUMP VILLAGE.
 AS MUCH AS I'M STILL GETTING
 OVERERNIE SANDERS, TRUMP BEING
 PRESIDENT IS SOMETHING I'LL
 NEVER GET USED TO.
 TRUMP VILLAGEAS BUILT BY H

 HIS FATHER.
 HE WAS LIKE A 14-YEAR-OLD KILL
 STILL IN A SUIT WANDER AROUND
  THE HAIR.
 HE WANTS TO BE A COMEDIAN.
 HE THINKS HE'S FUNNY AND HOW HE
 HAS A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE WHICH IS
 DANGEROUS.
 BEFORE I LET YOU GO, I WANT
 TO PLAY SOME OF YOUR WORK TO DO
 SOMETHING THAT NO ONE IS ASKING
 FOR WHICH WAS TRY TO MAKE
 HOLOCAUST SURVIVAL HUMORIST.
 PEOPLE HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ONE
 WAY OR THE OTHER AND YOU ARE
 JEWISH.
 RIGHT.
 LET'S TAKE LOOK AT THIS
 CLIP.
 HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE SHOW?
 DID YOU EVER SEE OUR SHOW?
 IT WAS CALLED THE HOLOCAUST.
 ALL I KNOW IS I WAS CLOSE TO
 THAT MILLION DOLLARS.
 EVERY ONE WAS TRYING TO KICK ME
 OFF THE SHOW.
 I'M A SURVIVOR.
  I'M A SURVIVOR.
 I'M A SURVOR.
 FUNNY.
 FUNNY?
 IF IT BENDS IT'S FUY.
 IT'S NOT REALLY EXPLOITING
 THE HOLOCAUST.
 WHO IS THE TARGET OF THE
 JOKE?
 THE TARGET IS THE GUY ON
 SURVIVOR.
 THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO
 SENSE OF WHAT THE HOLOCAUST AND
 HAVE A COMPETITIVE CONVERSATION
 WITH THE SURVIVOR SHOWS HOW
 OBLIVIOUS SHE.
 IT'S COMPLETELY FUNNY AND
 RELATABLE.
 ISN'T THERE THE OLD SAYING,
 IN YOU'RE IGNORANT OF HISTORY,
 YOU'RE DESTINED TO BE MADE FUN
 OF ON A PREMIUM CABLE SHOW?
 THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
 I'M ASKING THE QUESTIONS
 HERE.

 SATIRE VIOLENCE.
 WHAT'S MORE BITING THAN SATIRE?
 YOU'RE A BIT LIKE ANDY McCAB.
  DN'T WANT TO ANSWER, HE
 WOULD REPEAT THE QUESTION BACK
 OR SAY WHAT ARE YOU REALLY
 ASKING.
 I'M WAITING FOR MUELLER
 REPORT ALSO.
 LARRY CHARLES, I THINK YOU
 HAVE THAT IN COMMON WITH MANY
 PEOPLE.
 WHEN YOU LOOK A  COMEDY, IS IT A
 HELPFUL PART TO GET THROUGH OF
 WHAT YOU CALL A ROUGH PERIOD OR
 JUST AERSION

 COMEDY IS LIKE BREATHING AND
 EATING.
 LAUGHTER IS A CRUCIAL PART OF

 SURVIVAL.
 I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
 SUBJECT AND SOM WE NEED
 MORE THAN EVER NOW.
 LARRY CHARLES.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ALL RIG
