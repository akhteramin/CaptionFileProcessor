 I'M ALL THE WAY 100 WITH IT.
 I WOULD ON SOCIAL MEDIA, I'M
 TALKING BACK TO PEOPLE.
 "WHAT'D YOU SAY?"
 I'M DOING ALL THIS.
 PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW
 MUCH FUN WE WERE HAVING, THAT
 THE AUDIENCE HAD GREAT ENERGY.
 BUT THEN THEY WOULD LIKE, "NICK,

 I'M GLAD BECAUSE I'M EXCITED!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 WELCOME TO THE WENDY WILLIAMS
 SHOW.
 YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE ENERGY.
 WE DRESSED LOUD.
 Y'ALL SEE THESE LOUD SHOES.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 IT'S FUNNY, MY RUBY SLIPPERS.
 ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS, FUNNY
 COMEDIAN IN THE GAME, HE SAW ME
 AND SOME SHOES LIKE THIS ONE
 TIME AND SAID, "MA'AM, WHAT'S UP
 WITH THEM SHOES?
 YOU CLICK YOUR HEELS THREE TIMES
 AND YOU END UP BACK AT MARIAH'S
 HOUSE?"
 GOING TO MAKE THE MARIAH'S JOKES
 ON MY RUBY RED SLIPPERS...
 [LAUGHTER]
 SPEAKING OF FRIENDS, I TALKED
 THE OF THE DAY.
 SPEAKING OF COMEDY, I WAS SAYING
 IT LAST NIGHT WITH MY LITTLE
 BROTHER, PETE DAVIDSON.
 [APPLAUSE]
 WE WAS IN BROOKLYN!
 HE WANTED TO BE HERE, BUT --
 LOOK, I WAS FEELING MYSELF LAST
 NIGHT.
 HAD A LITTLE GREENERY.
 IT'S FOR MY LUPUS!
 MY LUPUS!
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I GOT A CARD!
 HE'S GOT PEOPLE.
 THEY REPRESENT HIM, THEY SAID IT
 MIGHT NOT BE THE SMARTEST THING
 FOR HIM AND I TO GET UP HERE AND
 START TALKING.
 BECAUSE WE VOWED TO SAY
 ANYTHING.
 I GOT PEOPLE, TOO.
 I JUST DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I TOLD PETE, WE WERE HAVING GOOD
 CONVERSATION.
 WE WERE HAVING COUGAR
 CONVERSATION.
 KATE BECKINSALE.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I TAUGHT THAT YOUNG BOY WELL.
 I'LL TELL YOU, I'M THE ONE -I
 WILL TAKE CREDIT FOR IT.
 I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD HIM, "GET
 YOU AN OLDER WOMAN, MAN!"
 I SAID THAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 "LEAVE THEM LITTLE POP STARS
 ALONE!
 AN OLD WOMAN KNOWS WHAT SHE
 WANTS!
 SHE DON'T PLAY NO GAMES!"
 THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
 YOU SOMEBODY OLDER!
 THEM LITTLE POP STARS, THEY
 DON'T KNOW!
 THE GIVING JAPANESE MENUS
 TATTOOED ON THEIR --
 I'M JOKING, BUT THAT IS ARIANA
 GRANDE'S HAND.
 I THINK THAT'S EVEN AFTER SHE
 TRIED TO FIX IT.
 SHE HAS A TATTOO, IT WAS
 SUPPOSED TO SAY "SEVEN RANKS,"
 FOR HER DOING SO WELL IN JAPAN.
 BUT ENDED UP SAYING "TINY
 BARBECUE."
 [LAUGHTER]
 THAT'S SOME YOUNG GIRL STUFF.
 OLDER WOMEN DON'T LIKE TARDY
 BARBECUES.
 THEY LIKE CHITLINS AND GRITS."
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU EVER THINK ABOUT GETTING
 "GRITS" TATTOOED ON YOU?
 GET IT RIGHT ON THE THIGH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I FEEL YOUR PAIN, ARIANA GRANDE.
 I FEEL YOUR PAIN.
 I GOT A JAPANESE TATTOO RIGHT
 THERE, TOO.
 THAT SAY "CALIFORNIA ROLLS."
 [LAUGHTER]
 I MADE THE SAME MISTAKE.
 BUT I TOLD -EVERYBODY KNOWS,
 YES, I DID AT ONE POINT GET
 MARIAH TATTOOED ALL ON MY BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]
 BUT THAT WAS FOR LOVE!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THAT'S LOVE RIGHT THERE!
 PEOPLE SAID, "DID YOU GET IT
 COVERED UP?"
 NO, I JUST ADDED TO IT.
 PUT SOME MORE ON THERE.
 PUT "JESUS" NEXT TO MARIA, MY
 KIDS.
 NOW IT'S LIKE A WHOLE FAMILY
 PICTURE BACK THERE.
 BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOU AN
 OLDER WOMAN.
 REMEMBER, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
 THAT YESTERDAY.
 MY TOP THREE.
 NUMBER ONE, MARIAH.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THE AMAZING MOTHER, SUPERSTAR
 SINGER.
 NUMBER TWO, HALLE BERRY.
 I'M STILL WORKING ON IT.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 I'VE STILL GOT SOME MORE TATTOO

 [LAUGHTER]

 [LAUGHTER]

 Norman: JENNIFER LOPEZ.
 Nick: I DON'T KNOW HER.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT WAS A JOKE!
 THAT WAS A JOKE FOR THE LAMBS!
 SHOUT OUT TO THE LAMBS.
 I'M PLAYING UP -IN ALL
 SERIOUSNESS, I'M GOING TO STOP
 USING THE WORD "OLDER WOMAN."
 I'M GOING TO STOP.
 I WANT MATURED.
 [APPLAUSE]
 SEASONED.
 PUT A LITTLE SPRINKLE ON IT.
 SEASON.
 THEY'RE WHAT SAYING?
 VINTAGE -I'M SORRY, MAMA.
 I'M SORRY, MAMA!
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I'M SORRY.
 I FORGOT IT WAS LIKE TO BE.
 I'M SORRY.
 BUT THAT'S WHAT I LIKE IN MY
 LIFE.
 I'M SORRY, MAMA.
 I LIKE A COUPLE OF YOUR FRIENDS,
 MAMA.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 JUST SAYING.
 MISS GERTRUDE GOT A LOT OF
 CHURCH AT BOOTY.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, THAT'S
 WHAT I LIKE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I'M SORRY.
 THE ONLY THING -I'M TRYING TO
 MAKE A POINT, I WAS TELLING
 PETE.
 THESE YOUNG GIRLS -I'M SINGLE,
 I CAN'T DEAL WITH ALL THAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 IT'S TOO MUCH!
 YOUNG GIRLS, THEY ARE COMING OUT
 WITH A PHONE.
 THEY WANT TO SNAPCHAT YOU AND
 FACE TIME, SEXTING.
 I GOT AN ANDROID!
 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK ON
 THAT.
 YOU SENDING ME PICTURES THAT ARE
 DISAPPEARING.
 I GOT ENOUGH TIME!
 GIRL, SEND ME A POLAROID!
 [LAUGHTER]
 I WANT SOMETHING I CAN SHAKE AND
 BLOW ON!
 PUT IT ON THE REFRIGERATOR!
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 SHOW MY SON!
 "YOUR POPS WAS COLD BACK IN THE
 DAY WITH THE COUGARS!"
 THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, THESE
 YOUNG GIRLS -"I'M ABOUT THE
 BAG.
 WE CAN GET TO THE BAG.
 BUY ME A BAG."
 I WANT A WOMAN WITH A
 POCKETBOOK.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 A MATURE WOMAN GOT A POCKETBOOK!
 SHE AIN'T GOT NO BAG!
 A POCKETBOOK, WITH ALL THE
 NECESSITIES AND IT!
 [LAUGHTER]
 SHE'S GOT ANYTHING YOU NEED.
 CHURCH MINTS.
 FIRST AID KIT.
 OINTMENT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 A MATURE SEASONED WOMAN.
 ALL THE COUGARS CALL ME.
 DMA, OR WHATEVER THEY DO NOW.
 [APPLAUSE]
 I KNOW I'M LOUD.
 I WOULD JUST SAY ANYTHING.
 I APOLOGIZE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, GETTING TO
 PROBABLY THE MOST HOT TOPIC -I
 WAS ONLINE, I WAS IN THERE
 COMMENTING ON THE SHADE ROOM AND
 "THE WENDY SHOW" IN ALL THIS.
 WHEN THIS WENT DOWN YESTERDAY, I
 WAS LIKE, "I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
 THIS TOMORROW."
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 LIAM NEESON GOT HIMSELF INTO A
 LOT OF TROUBLE YESTERDAY!
 HE WAS OUT PROMOTING HIS NEW
 MOVIE, WHICH IS ABOUT SEEKING
 REVENGE.
 AND HE TOLD A STORY ABOUT
 WANTING TO SEEK REVENGE IN REAL
 LIFE.
 HE WAS OVER SHARING.
 ABOUT A CLOSE FRIEND WHO WAS
 RAPED, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE
 MOST HORRENDOUS THING THAT CAN
 HAPPEN TO ANYONE IN THIS WORLD.
 I FEEL HIS ANGER AND HIS PAIN.
 BUT THEN IT WAS LIKE, BECAUSE
 SHE WAS RAPED BY A BLACK MAN, IT
 WENT TO DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
 HE STARTED SAYING SOME THINGS --
 AS A MATTER OF FACT, LET'S
 LISTEN TO IT SO I COULD LET HIM
 SPEAK FOR HIMSELF BEFORE I GET
 INTO ALL THAT.
 WE GOING TO LISTEN.
 JUST LISTEN.
 I ASKED DID YOU KNOW WHO IT
 WAS?
 NO.
 WHAT COLOR WERE THEY?
 SHE SAID IT WAS A BLACK PERSON.
 I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN AREAS WITH
 A COSH HOPING TO BE APPROACHED
 BY SOMEBODY.
 I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THAT.
 I DID IT FOR MAYBE A WEEK,
 HOPING SOME BLACK -WOULD COME
 OUT OF THE PUB AND HAVE A GO AT
 ME ABOUT SOMETHING, SO I COULD
 KILL HIM.
 WHO ARE YOU CALLING -HE'S
 TRYING TO BE THE NEXT MEL GIBSON
 OUT HERE!
 I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THIS -WE
 THROW THE STUFF AROUND, AND I
 UNDERSTAND HIS ANGER.
 BUT THERE IS NO REASON TO WANT
 TO KILL SOMEONE JUST BASED OFF
 OF THE COLOR, THEIR RACE --
 [APPLAUSE]
 THE THING THAT, WHEN YOU'RE
 DEALING WITH RACISM, THE IDEA
 THAT HE WAS ANGRY ABOUT THE RAP
 RAPE -AS WE SHOULD ALL BE --
 WITHIN THE NEXT QUESTION HE ASKS
 IS, "WHAT COLOR WAS HE?"
 I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S JUST TRYING
 TO FIND A DESCRIPTION, BECAUSE
 COLOR SHOULDN'T MATTER.
 WE ARE NOT CRAYONS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 BUT, YOU KNOW -I SEE WHERE HE
 WAS GOING WITH IT.
 BUT I THINK YOU JUST REALLY
 THINKS HE'S THE CHARACTER FROM "
 HE SAID HE WENT OUT FOR A WEEK
 OF LOOKING FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
 YOU COULDN'T FIND NO BLACK
 PEOPLE?
 HE SAID HE WENT TO THE PUB.
 FIRST OF ALL, BLACK PEOPLE DON'T
 GO TO PUBS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 WE DON'T GO TO THE PUB.
 WE GO TO THE CLUB.
 OKAY?
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU OUT THERE LOOKING AT PUBS --
 IF YOU HAD WENT TO MAGIC CITY,
 STARLETS OR SOMETHING, YOU
 WOULD'VE FOUND THAT'S WHERE WE
 ARE OVER THERE HANGING.
 YOU FOUND THEM.
 I'M RIGHT HERE.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 I WANT ALL THE SMOKE.
 I WILL TAKE THAT.
 I THINK HE WAS OVER SHARING,
 BECAUSE EVEN THE TERM "RACISM,"
 YOU GO A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR --
 WE ALWAYS THROW THAT WORD OUT
 THERE.
 "OH, THAT'S RACIST."
 RACISM IS ABOUT SYSTEMIC
 OPPRESSION.
 RACISM IS ABOUT POWER.
 THIS IS JUST IGNORANCE.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 I THINK HE IS AWARE OF THAT.
 I THINK HE PROBABLY FELT HE
 NEEDED TO CLEAN IT UP, SO THIS
 MORNING, AS WE SAW JUST A FEW
 MINUTES AGO, HE WENT ON
 "GOOD MORNING AMERICA" TO TRY
 AND CLEAN UP THE MESS.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
 IF YOUR FRIEND HAD SAID IT
 WAS A WHITE MAN QUESTIONING
 IF SHE HAD SAID IRISH, OR A
 SCOTT, BRITT, A LITHUANIAN COME
 I WOULD'VE HAD THE SAME REACTIO
 REACTION.
 IF IT'S AN INNOCENT BLACK MAN
 WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT --
 THAT WAS MY FEELING PRAYED
 THAT I DID WANT TO LASH OUT.
 I DID SEEK OUT -I WENT TO A
 PRIEST, I HAD MY CONFESSION.
 BELIEVE IT OR NOT, POWER
 WALKING.
 TWO HOURS EVERY DAY.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Nick: POWER WALKING?
 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO WALK THE
 RACISM OFF?
 [LAUGHTER]
 "YEAH, MAMA!
 I'M GOING TO GET ALL THIS
 BIGOTRY OUT ME!
 TWO MORE MINUTES ON MY FITBIT!"
 YOU CAN'T WALK RACISM OFF!
 POWER WALKING QUESTION RECORD IS
 GOING TO WALK IT OUT, HUH?
 IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU -HE THINKS
 HE'S THE GUY IN THE MOVIE.
 "I HAVE SOME VERY SPECIAL RACIST
 SKILLS.

 I WANT TO FIX THIS FOR YOU,
 BROTHER.
 I DON'T THINK IS RACIST.
 I JUST THINK HE'S A LITTLE --
 IT'S THAT SOCIOPATHIC BEHAVIOR.
 WHERE HE THINKS HE'S THE GUY IN
 THE MOVIE.
 YOU'RE GOING TO WALK UP ON SO
 PEOPLE IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY,
 INCORPORATED GOING TO BE NO
 STUNT COORDINATORS!
 [APPLAUSE]
 WE'VE GOT A WHOLE LOT OF BLACK
 PEOPLE YOU CAN FIND.
 I'M GOING TO FIX THIS.
 I'M A FAN OF THE "TAKEN" MOVIES.
 I'M A FAN OF "SCHINDLER'S LIST,"
 ALL OF THIS.
 I'LL FIX IT.
 I'VE GOT A WAY TO FIX IT, YOU
 ALL.
 GOING TO DO IT.
 LIAM NEESON, I CHALLENGE YOU TO
 A CELEBRITY BOXING MATCH!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 IT'S GOING DOWN!
 WE'RE GOING TO DONATE ALL THE
 MONEY TO THE NAACP!
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU GET ALL THAT ANGER ABOUT
 YOU.
 I WILL TAKE THAT FEED.
 IT'S A CLEAN FIGHT, WE WILL PUT
 ON THE GLOVES.
 I THINK IT.
 RIGHT?
 DO Y'ALL THINK I COULD TAKE HIM?
 I'LL DO THIS MOVIE IN DUBAI, I
 WILL PULL UP.
 I'M GOING TO GET TO IT.
 GO SEE HIS MOVIE THIS WEEKEND.
 [LAUGHTER]
 HE SAID IT'S A DARK COMEDY.
 WHY IT GOT TO BE A DARK COMEDY?
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 SPEAKING OF PEOPLE WHO CAN
 FIGHT, CARDI B IS BACK!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 SHOULD YOU WITH ONE OF THE RED
 BOTTOMS REAL QUICK.
 SHE ALSO HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH
 "GOOD MORNING AMERICA"
 YESTERDAY.
 AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER
 DATING LIFE.
 YOU KNOW WHEN HER AND OFFSET WAS
 UPSET.
 [LAUGHTER]
 THEY SPLIT FOR A MINUTE, AND
 CARDI HAD SOME INTERESTING
 THINGS TO SAY.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW DAYS WHO
 WANTS YOU FOR YOU.
 I THINK PEOPLE WANT ME FOR CARDI
 B.
 AS SOON AS I SAID I'M DOING A
 VIDEO, THAT ARE NOT WITH THIS
 GUY ANYMORE, I'VE GOT ALL THESE
 MAY ALSO LIVES IN MY DM PLAYER
 LIST.
 YOU WANT TO GO TO DINNER WITH
 ME, CARDI B?
 [LAUGHS]
 ARGUE ABOUT DATES?
 IT'S LIKE, BRO.
 [LAUGHTER] I'M SORRY, IT WAS ME.
 I'M SORRY.
 I TOLD YOU, I'M SINGLE.
 I WAS TRYING TO BE FIRST!
 I DON'T DO THE DM THING.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SLIDE TO THE
 DM.
 I GOT A BAD HIP, I CAN'T SLIDE.
 I DO.
 BECAUSE I SEE, I'M ONLINE LIKE
 THAT.
 IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A WEIRD
 CONCEPT.
 THIS IS A MARRIED WOMAN.
 YOU DON'T JUST GO --
 THEIR WORKING SURVEY THINGS, BUT
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SLIDE UP --
 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR HUSBAND IS
 OFFSET!
 HE'S GOT FACE TATTOOS!
 THERE'S GONNA BE SOME
 REPERCUSSIONS FOR SLIDING INTO
 HIS WOMAN'S DMs.
 IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF HIS
 SHOWS, HE SAID, "DAMN ALL THAT,
 I'M GOING TO GET MY WOMAN BACK!"
 THAT'S LIVER THERE.
 THEY SAID THEY ARE WORKING IT
 OUT.
 THEY'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL BABY,
 CULTURE.
 THAT SOME STRONG LIVER THERE.
 I LOVE ALL OF THAT.
 I WILL BE SLIDING INTO ANYMORE
 DMs.
 SORRY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 AND THE RATINGS ARE IN!
 I'M SO PROUD OF AMERICA RIGHT
 NOW.
 I HAVE TO SAY THIS.
 THE SUPER BOWL WAS A SLEEPER
 BOWL!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THIS YEAR'S SUPER BOWL WAS THE
 LOWEST RATED SUPER BOWL IN TEN
 YEARS.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IT'S FOR
 MANY DIFFERENT REASONS.
 PEOPLE TIRED OF TOM BRADY
 WINNING.
 I'M GOING TO KEEP IT.
 I LOVE TOM BRADY.
 KEEP ON WINNING.
 I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT WE WERE
 ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AT
 THIS.
 WE SAID WE'RE GOING TO STEP BACK
 AND MAKE A STATEMENT, A PEACEFUL
 PROTEST FOR MY BROTHER,
 COLIN KAEPERNICK.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TO SHOW THAT --
 YEAH.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 A PEACEFUL PROTEST.
 AND THAT IS A SALUTE TO THE
 VETERANS, A SALUTE TO
 LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND HONESTLY,
 THE FACT THAT HERE IN AMERICA WE
 CAN PEACEFULLY PROTEST WITHOUT
 PUNISHMENT.
 THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
 IT SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT ANY KIND
 OF BANNING SOMEONE OR
 BLACKBALLING OR ANY TYPE OF
 STUFF.
 I KNOW THIS BROTHER PERSONALLY.
 HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE, AND HE
 DID IT AND IS DOING IT FOR ALL
 THE RIGHT REASONS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 SPEAKING OF THE RIGHT REASONS,
 TODAY IS A SPECIAL DAY.
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVE ON
 MARTIN'S 24TH BIRTHDAY TODAY
 THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE REASON WHY MY BROTHER, COLIN KAEPERNIC
 COLIN KAEPERNICK, WAS TAKING
 MONEY.
 I'M GOING TO CONTINUE.
 WE ARE GOING TO ALL TAKE THE
 KNEE.
 NFL, PAY ATTENTION!
 WE KNOW THAT WAS A GIANT DISPLAY
 OF CAPITALISM.
 YOU NEED THE RATINGS THAT.
 GIVE MY MAN COLIN A JOB.
 I WANT TO SEE HIM SO THAT
 FOOTBALL AGAIN!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 BRING JANET JACKSON BACK!
 LET HER CONTROL!
 I'M GOING TO PULL MY NIPPLES OUT
 THIS TIME!
 I'LL DO THE DRUM LINED AND
 EVERYTHING.
 WE WILL HAPPEN.
 THAT WAS "HOT TOPICS."
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 KENAN THOMPSON IS UP NEXT.
 MY FRIEND IS HERE.
 GRAB A SNACK AND COME ON BACK!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]


 Nick: [WHISPERING]
 WELCOME BACK TO THE
 WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW.

 WE LOVE THAT!
 I'M REALLY EXCITED TO INTRODUCE
 YOU TO MY FAMILY, A TRUE FAMILY
 MEMBER.
 ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS.
 YES.
 REALLY, MY BROTHER PRAYED THIS
 IS MY BROTHER, Y'ALL.
 HE'S ALSO THE LONGEST RUNNING
 CAST MEMBER IN
 "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" HISTORY.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 TAKE A LOOK.
 I UNDERSTAND.
 IT IS NORMAL THAT SHE WOULD
 VOLUNTEER TO COOK FOR EVERYONE.
 ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER HAD POTATO
 SALAD, I SENSE THAT THIS WHITE
 WOMAN DOES NOT SEE HER FOOD.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 AND IF SHE DOES, IT IS ONLY
 WITH A TINY BIT OF SALT.
 AND NO PAPRIKA.
 AND SHE WILL PROBABLY ADD
 SOMETHING UNNECESSARY LIKE
 RAISINS.
 I KNOW, RIGHT?
 [LAUGHTER]
 SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT I
 SHOULD SAY --
 SAY IT.
 "AW HELL NAH, KAREN!
 KEEP YOUR POTATO SALAD
 YOURSELF!"
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU GOT IT!
 BLACK PANTHER, WELCOME TO BLACK
 JEOPARDY.

 Kenan: I'M DOING IT FOR THE
 GRAHAM GRAHAM.
 Nick: ONE TIME
 I AM GOING TO BE HONEST, I WOULD BE SITTING THERE THIS MOMENT
 TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS
 BROTHER RIGHT HERE.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 ARE USED TO DRIVE UP AFTER
 SCHOOL, TWO AND A HALF HOUR
 DRIVE COME ALL THE WAY TO
 HOLLYWOOD TO STAND IN LINE TO DO
 STAND-UP COMEDY FOR LIKE
 2 MINUTES.
 THIS DUDE WOULD COME OUT,
 SUPPORT, BE IN THE CLUB, SHOW

 THAT WAS BACK IN THE DAY!
 Kenan: [LAUGHS]
 Nick: HE WAS ALREADY ON
 NICKELODEON.
 A SUPERSTAR.
 I WAS A HUGE FAN.
 I WAS A FAN OF "ALL THAT."
 NOT ONLY DID HE INTRODUCE ME TO
 HIS MANAGER, WHO BE STILL ROCK
 WITH TODAY.
 THAT'S ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER.
 THAT'S LOYALTY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THIS IS THE THING -I USED TO
 TAKE MY MOM'S OLD BROKE DOWN BMW
 FROM THE '80s, LIKE AN OLD
 DOPE DEALER CARD.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I WOULD DRIVE UP, AND I WOULD
 HAVE TO SLEEP IN MY CAR.
 KENAN LET ME STAY IN HIS HOUSE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HE BROUGHT ME IN!
 HE MAY BE EVER MADE!
 I WAS LIKE HIS LITTLE BROTHER.
 Kenan: LET ME BACK UP -I
 MEAN, THE AMOUNT OF HUSTLE THAT
 YOU HAVE IN THE AMOUNT OF DRIVE
 AND THE AMOUNT OF TALENT, YOU
 WOULD HAVE BEEN WHEREVER YOU WAS
 GOING TO BE REGARDLESS.
 Nick: THANK YOU, MAN!
 [APPLAUSE]
 Kenan: I RECOGNIZED THAT
 HUSTLE A NEW PAIR THAT'S WHY I
 EMBRACE YOU.
 BECAUSE I HAD AN APARTMENT AND
 IT WAS A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT.
 THE OTHER BEDROOM WAS JUST WIDE
 OPEN.
 I SAW A YOUNG BROTHER WHO HAD
 DRIVE, WHO WANTED TO DO IT LIKE
 I DID IT.
 COMING FROM ATLANTA, I KNOW WHAT
 IT'S LIKE TO GET ON THAT
 FREEWAY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Wendy: I APPRECIATED!
 I WAS BROKE AT THE TIME
 BETWEEN EVERYTHING GOING DOWN, I GOT A JOB.

 AFTER THAT.
 WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING, BECAUSE
 HE BECAME MY FRIEND, MY MENTOR,
 MY BIG BROTHER, I ACTUALLY
 BECAME THE AUDIENCE WARM-UP.
 ENTERTAINING AUDIENCE.

 Nick:        Kenan: GIVE P
 BAND SOME LOVE!
 YOU'VE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE!
 Nick: HE INTRODUCE ME TO
 THE WRITERS ON THE SHOW AND I
 BECAME ONE OF THE YOUNGEST
 WRITERS IN TELEVISION HISTORY,
 WRITING FOR THIS MAN'S TV SHOW.
 Kenan: AND THEN HE GOT ON
 THE SHOW!
 AND I LOOK AT YOU.
 Nick: WE BECAME INMATES FOR
 REAL.
 I STARTED PAYING SOME RENT!

 THIGHS ALL OUT!
 I WOULD NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.
 I'M SORRY.

 WOODEN TYPE OF LOG CABIN.

 A WOODEN-MADE HOT TUB BUT IT

 HOT TUB THAT NEVER WORKED.

 BATHROOM, THOUGH!
 Nick: THAT WAS MY BATHROOM!
 IT WASN'T TO BE RUNNING ALL DOWN
 THE STREET!
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Kenan: IT WOULD STAY
 FLASHING, ONE OF THE TOILETS
 WOULD SAY FLUSHING.
 SOMEBODY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR
 LIKE, "EXCUSE US, Y'ALL HAVE
 TISSUE RUNNING DOWN THE STREET
 BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO
 TURN THE WATER OFF."
 THAT'S DISGUSTING.
 Nick: GIRLS WERE LIKE "I
 AIN'T COMING OUT TO YOUR HOUSE,
 NO MORE!"
