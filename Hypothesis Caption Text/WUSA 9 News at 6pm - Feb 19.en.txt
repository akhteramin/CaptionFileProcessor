 CHILDREN. THE NEWS THAT 6:00 STARTS RIGHT
 NOW.
 WE BEGIN WITH THE THREAT OF WICKED WINTER WEATHER THAT IS
 NEARLY AT OUR DOORSTEP.
 WHAT IS THE LATEST?
 WE ARE JUST HOURS FROM SNOW
 BREAKING OUT ACROSS THE METRO
 AREA, ABOUT 12 HOURS FROM SNOW
 IN THE METRO.
 LET'S GO OVER THE SNOWFALL
 TOTALS AGAIN.
 THESE ARE LOWER THAN WHAT WE
 SHOWED YOU YESTERDAY THAT DOES
 MEAN THE ROADS WILL BE BETTER.
 3 TO 5 INCHES IN LEESBURG AND
 GAITHERSBURG AND MARTINSBURG
 AND POINTS NORTH AND WEST.
 WE COULD EXCEED THE 3 TO 5 INCH
 MARK.
 1 TO 3 IN THE IMMEDIATE METRO
 AREA AND DC AND ROCKVILLE IN
 BETHESDA AND FAIRFAX AND EVEN
 INTO WALDORF.
 EXTREME SOUTHERN MARYLAND, WE
 ARE TALKING ABOUT A TRACE.
 THAT HASN'T CHANGED MUCH, YOU
 DON'T HAVE THE COLD AIR IN
 PLACE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT
 MUCH SNOW.
 SO WHAT ABOUT THE MODELS?
 HAVE THEY COME INTO A SIMILAR
 WAY OF THINKING?
 STILL FOR HALF OF THE P.M., ALL
 THE REST OF THE MODELS ARE
 UNDER THREE INCHES, SO I THINK
 THEY FINALLY GOT A HANDLE ON
 HOW MUCH SLEEP IS GOING TO
 FALL.
 ONCE AGAIN, MODERATE TO HEAVY
 SNOW 6 AM TO NOON AND ROADS
 WILL BE DANGEROUS, IT WILL
 CUMULATE QUICKLY AND ONCE IT
 STARTS, IT PICKS UP IN
 INTENSITY QUICKLY.
 SNOW WILL TURN TO A MIXED NORTH
 AND WEST IN THE AFTERNOON AND
 IT TURNS TO RAIN IN DC SOUTH
 AND EAST IN THE AFTERNOON AND
 SOME OF THE RAIN TO THE HEAVY
 OVERNIGHT AND EVERYONE GOES TO
 RAIN OVERNIGHT AND THEN MORNING
 SHOWERS ON THURSDAY AND THEN WE
 ARE IN THE 50s.
 NO SHORTAGE OF MOISTURE.
 THIS IS A TREMENDOUS STORM
 STRETCHING ALREADY FROM CAPE
 HATTERAS BACK TO KANSAS CITY
 AND BACK TO IOWA.
 5 AM SNOW ON THE DOORSTEP, BUT
 SNOW ALREADY A COUPLE HOURS IN
 CULPEPER AND SNOWING ALREADY IN
 MANASSAS AND BY 7:00, SNOWING
 ACROSS THE METRO AREA AND
 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY AND
 BALTIMORE AND BY 10:00, WE
 STILL HAVE SNOW WITH THE MIX
 DOWN TO THE SOUTH AND THEY
 THINK IT IS SLOW ERODING THE
 COLD AIR AND I THINK WILL GO TO
 THE MIX IN DC BY NOON WITH SNOW
 HANGING NORTH OF FREDERICK AND
 I-70 AND BY 4:00, JUST RAIN IN
 THE DC AREA COME BUT STILL
 HANGING ONTO ICE NORTH AND
 WEST.
 WE COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE
 POTENTIAL FOR AN ICE STORM
 NORTH AND WEST OF TOWN WHEN THE
 SNOW TRANSITIONS FROM SNOW AND
 FREEZING RAIN.
 TIME FOR PREPARATIONS
 UNDERWAY ALL ACROSS THE DMV FOR
 THE WINTER STORM LATE TONIGHT,
 SALT AND PLOW TRUCKS WILL BE
 STANDBY AT THE READY.
 THE BLOOMING PANSIES OR
 DAFFODILS PUSHING UP COULD FOOL
 YOU, LATE FEBRUARY SNOWSTORMS
 CAN PACK A PUNCH WITH HUGE
 SNOWFALLS.
 ARE YOU READY FOR THE SNOW?
 READY OR NOT, IT IS COMING,
 HARDWARE STORES STOCKED UP ON
 SHOVELS AND SLEDS.
 AND IN VIRGINIA, DDOT HAS
 ALREADY STARTED TREATING ROADS.
 THE STREAKS ON THE ROAD ARE
 FROM BRINE OVERNIGHT.
 THIS IS ONE OF THE 18
 FACILITIES ACROSS NORTHERN
 VIRGINIA.
 IT LOOKS EMPTY NOW, BUT BY
 MIDNIGHT, IT WILL BE ROCKING.
 A CONTINUOUS LINE OF PLOW
 TRUCKS PHILIP FROM THE SALT
 DOME TO TREAT MAJOR ROADS.
 ALLEN, LOCKE US SAYS HE WILL
 HAVE 3000 TRUCKS COVERING
 14,000 MILES OF ROAD.
 MOST OF THE FLEET IS A
 CONTRACT FLEET, SO THESE TRUCKS
 ARE LANDSCAPING TRUCKS OR
 CONSTRUCTION TRUCKS, BY DAY,
 AND WHEN THEY GO FROM CLARK
 KENT TO BEING SUPERMAN AND THEY
 BECOME OUR PLOW TRUCKS AT NIGHT
 DOES
 EACH TRUCK NEEDS A SPREADER.
 IS BETTER MOVES IN AND IT
 PACKS IN AND THEY GET A LOAD OF
 SALT, AND THEY DRIVE OFF AND AS
 THEY DRIVE, IT SPREADS SALT
 EVENLY ON THE ROADS.
 THE TRUCKS DO NOT PLOW RIGHT
 AWAY, THEY WAIT FOR A SIGNAL.
 AS SOON AS SNOW GETS TWO INCHES
 HIGH, BE.PUTS OUT THE CALL.
 PLOWS DOWN, AND THEN THINGS GET
 EXCITING.
 WHAT WE ARE ASKING IS FOR
 PEOPLE TO STAY OFF THE ROADS ON
 WEDNESDAY.
 WITH THE AMOUNT OF SNOW WE WILL
 BE GETTING AND WITH THE RATE IN
 WHICH IT WILL BE FALLING, WE
 ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT
 ESPECIALLY DURING THE SHOWER.
 AND FAIRFAX COUNTY, PEGGY
 FOX, WUSA9.
 AND REMINDER BECAUSE OF THE
 WINTRY WEATHER WE ARE
 EXPECTING, THE WAKE-UP WASHING
 THAT HE WILL BE ON EARLY , 4:00
 IN THE MORNING WITH THE LATEST
 ON CONDITIONS AND CLOSINGS
 ACROSS THE AREA.
 I'M BERNIE SANDERS AND I'M
 RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
 VERMONT SANDERS, VERMONT
 SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS NEEDED
 OFFICIAL, HE IS JOINING AND IS
 THE 10th CANDIDATE TO CHALLENGE
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE 2020
 ELECTION.
 IN AN INTERVIEW WITH JOHN
 DICKERSON, THE 77-YEAR-OLD
 PROGRESSIVE SAYS HE IS OKAY IF
 PEOPLE CALL HIM A RADICAL.
 I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE ARE
 INHERENTLY ENTITLED TO HEALTH
 CARE AND INHERENTLY ENTITLED TO
 GET THE BEST EDUCATION THEY
 CAN.
 THE TRUMPET MINISTRATION
 REACTED TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT
 SAYING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL
 REJECT AN AGENDA OF SKYHIGH
 TAXES AND GOVERNMENT RUN
 HEALTHCARE AND CODDLING
 DICTATORS LIKE THOSE IN
 VENEZUELA.
 SANDERS SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT
 THE U.S. TO BECOME VENEZUELA
 AND HE HOPES AMERICANS DO NOT
 BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
 TO SAY.
 LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE
 MOUNTING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
 HIS DECLARATION OF THE NATIONAL
 EMERGENCY TO FULLY FUND THE
 BORDER WALL.
 NATALIE BRAD BREAKS DOWN THE
 LEGAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE
 PRESIDENT'S MOVES.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DEFENDING
 HIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY
 DECLARATION TO BUILD A SOUTHERN
 BORDER WALL.
 I HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO
 CALL NATIONAL SECURITY.
 WE NEED STRONG BORDERS AND WE
 HAVE TO STOP DRUGS AND CRIME
 AND CRIMINALS.
 BUT PROFESSOR SEIDMAN FROM
 GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY SAYS THE
 STATISTICS MAY NOT BE IN THE
 PRESIDENT'S FAVOR AS THE
 DECLARATION FACES MULTIPLE
 LEGAL CHALLENGES.
 BORDER CROSSINGS ARE WAY
 DOWN FROM WHERE THEY WERE
 SEVERAL YEARS AGO, MOST OF THE
 DRUGS THAT THE PRESENT WORRIES
 ABOUT COME THROUGH PORTS OF
 ENTRY.
 16 STATES INCLUDING
 CALIFORNIA ARE ASSUMING
 PRESIDENT TRUMP ARGUING THAT HE
 DOES NOT HAVE THE
 CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO
 DECLARE THE EMERGENCY.
 A SEPARATE LAWSUIT FROM MEMBERS
 OF CONGRESS THAT ALSO BECOMING
 ON THE SAME GROUNDS.
 CONGRESS HAS PRETTY MUCH
 EXPRESSLY DECIDED NOT TO SPEND
 THIS MONEY.
 MUCH OF THE MONEY WILL COME
 FROM THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
 BUDGET, SPECIALIST SAY DHS IS
 ALREADY LOOKING AT CONSTRUCTION
 LOCATIONS.
 WE KNOW THERE WILL BE A
 LARGE PORTION OF IT BEING BUILT
 IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY.
 WHICH SETS UP ANOTHER LEGAL
 BATTLE WITH TEXAS LANDOWNERS,
 THREE OF THEM HAVE ALREADY
 FILED SUIT OVER POSSIBLE LAND
 SEIZURES.
 THOSE PEOPLE MORE CLEARLY
 MAYBE THAN ANYONE ELSE HAVE
 STANDINGS TO OBJECT TO WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAS DONE.
 LIKE THE PRESENT AND MOST
 LEGAL EXPERTS, FOR PFIZER
 SEIDMAN SAID THE SUPREME COURT
 WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE THE
 ISSUE.
 THE NEW NPR PBS NEWS HOUR
 SHOWS THAT OVERALL A MAJORITY
 OF AMERICANS DISAPPROVE OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S USE OF THE NATIONAL
 EMERGENCY TO BUILD A WALL.
 WE ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING
 NEWS OUT OF SOUTH DC.
 IT IS BEEN A VIOLENT AFTERNOON.
 A TEENAGER WAS SHOT ALONG THE
 2600 BLOCK OF SANDS ROAD.
 DC POLICE SAY THE BOY WAS
 CONSCIOUS AND BREATHING WHEN
 FIRST RESPONDERS RUSHED INTO
 THE HOSPITAL.
 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT LED UP TO
 THE SHOOTING.
 POLICE SAY THEY ARE LOOKING FOR
 A SUSPECT WEARING A BLUE HOODIE
 AND TAN KHAKI PANTS LASTING
 HEADING TOWARDS DOUGLAS ROAD.
 AND ABOUT 20 MINUTES FROM THERE
 EARLIER TODAY, A CRIME ALERT
 ABOUT ANOTHER CRIME, THREE
 PEOPLE INCLUDING A CHILD WERE
 SHOT AND IN THAT INCIDENCE, ELI
 PLACE TO THE FORT DuPONT ICE
 ARENA, CASINGS COULD BE SEEN
 ENTERING THE STREET ALONG WITH
 A LEXUS SEDAN WITH WINDOWS SHUT
 UP.
 ALL BUT ONE OF THE VICTIMS WAS
 CONSCIOUS AND BREATHING WHEN
 THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE
 HOSPITAL.
 WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A
 MOTIVE OR SUSPECTS IN THAT
 INCIDENT.
 AN IMPORTANT MEETING AT
 WINSTON CHURCHILL HIGH SCHOOL,
 PARENTS OF THE MONTGOMERY
 COUNTY SCHOOL ART INVITED, ARE
 INVITED TO DISCUSS AN EVENT
 WHERE STUDENTS HANDED OUT
 PASSES GRANTING PERMISSION TO
 USE THE N WORD.
 THEY WILL ADDRESS A SWASTIKA
 DRAWN ON THE DESK EARLIER THIS
 YEAR.
 THE MEETING IS SET TO BEGIN AT
 7:00 TONIGHT.
 COMING UP, FREDERICK COUNTY
 MOMS DETAINED BY IMMIGRATION
 OFFICERS TALK ABOUT HER
 NIGHTMARE AND THE LONG-AWAITED
 REUNION WITH HER FAMILY.
 STOMACH AND VATICAN SECRETS,
 DESPITE THE VOW OF CELIBACY,
 THE CATHOLIC
 A JEWISH CEMETERY WAS FOUND DESECRATED TODAY IN EASTERN
 FRANCE.
 SWASTIKAS AND INSCRIPTIONS WERE
 FOUND ON SOME 80 GRAVES IN A
 VILLAGE LOCATED CLOSE TO
 STRASBURG.
 THIS COMES TWO MONTHS AFTER
 ANOTHER JEWISH CEMETERY WAS
 VANDALIZED AND ON THE DAY THAT
 FRANCE HELD A LARGE GATHERING
 AGAINST TERRACE TO PROTEST.
 EMMANUEL MACRON VISITED THE
 HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL IN THE CITY.
 CBS NEWS CONFIRMED THE
 VATICAN HAS KEPT SECRET
 GUIDELINES FOR PRIESTS WHO
 FATHER CHILDREN.
 NEARLY 9 CENTURIES, THE
 CATHOLIC CHURCH HAD FORBIDDEN
 PRIESTS FROM HAVING SEX AND
 GETTING MARRIED.
 DARA THOMAS SAYS SHE IS PROOF
 THAT PRIESTS SOMETIMES BREAK
 THE BOWS AND HER MOTHER WAS
 TOLD BY THE CHURCH TO KEEP HER
 BIRTHDAY SECRET.
 SHE FIRST MET HER FATHER IN
 ENGLAND WHEN SHE WAS 14 YEARS
 OLD.
 IT BECAME APPARENT THAT HE
 COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T OR WASN'T
 ALLOWED TO BE ANY SORT OF A
 FATHER TO ME.
 WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF
 ALL OF THIS GROWING UP?
 FEELING VERY ISOLATED, I
 LITERALLY THOUGHT I WAS THE
 ONLY PRIEST CHILD IN THE WORLD.
 THEY PUBLISHED
 GROUNDBREAKING GUIDELINES AND
 CHURCH OFFICIALS IN AMERICA ARE
 LOOKING AT A SIMILAR MODEL.
 POPE FRANCIS MEETING IN ROME
 TO MEET WITH BISHOPS TO TALK
 ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDALS AND
 THE PLAGUE ON MULTIPLE
 COMMENTS.

 A FREDERICK COUNTY MOM AND LOCAL CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER AT
 THE CENTER OF AN IMMIGRATION
 BATTLE IS REUNITED WITH HER
 KIDS.
 ROXANA SANTOS TALK ABOUT THE
 TERROR OF BEING DETAINED BY ICE
 FOR NEARLY A MONTH.
 DESPITE A FEDERAL JUDGE'S ORDER
 BLOCKING HER DEPORTATION.
 Reporter: ROXANA SANTOS
 SPEAKING IN SPANISH SAYS SHE IS
 LIVING IN TERROR THAT SHE COULD
 BE TAKEN FROM HER FOUR KIDS
 AGAIN AT ANY MOMENT, THE THREE
 YOUNGEST INCLUDING SIX-YEAR-OLD
 TWINS ARE U.S. CITIZENS.
 I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH MY MOM.
 I'M REALLY SCARED THEY COULD
 SEPARATE ME FROM MY CHILDREN
 AGAIN.
 Reporter: SHE WAS TAKEN BY
 ICE AND LOCKED UP IN A RURAL
 COUNTY JAIL AND THREATENED WITH
 DEPORTATION IN JANUARY,
 SPARKING PROTESTS.
 SHE WON A CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT FOR
 ILLEGALLY PROFILING HER LEADING
 TO AN UNJUSTIFIED ARREST IN

 THE FINAL STAGE OF THE CASE IS
 STILL IN COURT.
 THAT IS THE REASON THE JUDGE
 BLOCKED HER DEPORTATION FOR
 NOW.
 IMMIGRATION HAS NO
 PRIORITIES ANYMORE, THEY'RE
 GOING AFTER MOTHERS AND GOING
 AFTER YOUNG PEOPLE.
 WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM AND
 MAKE SURE THEY ARE COMFORTABLE
 INTERACTING WITH THE LOCAL
 POLICE AND THAT IS NOT A
 PIPELINE TO DEPORTATION.
 THE FACT IS SHE DID
 ILLEGALLY EMIGRATE 14 YEARS AGO
 TO FLEE VIOLENCE IN EL
 SALVADOR, WHICH MEANS ICE IS
 WITHIN ITS RIGHTS TO ATTEMPT TO
 SEPARATE THE FAMILY AGAIN.
 IN HYATTSVILLE, SCOTT BROOME,
 WUSA9.
 A LOT OF SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY
 CALLING IT NOW.
 FOR GOOD REASON, THE ROADS
 WILL BE A MESS.
 BETWEEN 6 AM AND NOON, THAT
 WILL BE THE BIG SHOT OF SNOW
 AND THE HEAVY SNOW AND IT WILL
 ACCUMULATE QUICKLY.
 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY.
 WHEN IT STARTS TO SNOW, IT WILL
 BECOME A MODERATE TO HEAVY VERY
 SOON AND ACCUMULATE QUICKLY.
 WE HAVE 3 TO 5 IN LEESBURG AND
 GAITHERSBURG AND JUST NORTH OF
 ROCKVILLE AND JUST TOUCHING
 PARTS OF FAIRFAX COUNTY AND
 NORTHERN PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY.
 THERE ARE SPOTS THAT COULD GET
 MORE THAN FIVE INCHES.
 IN THE METRO AREA, 1 TO 3
 INCHES AND WE COULD END UP WITH
 TWO INCHES OF SNOW AND AN INCH
 OF SLEET.
 THAT INCLUDES BETHESDA AND DOWN
 TO WALDORF AND FREDERICKSBURG.
 TO THE SOUTH OF FREDERICKSBURG
 ACROSS INTO THE SOUTHERN
 MARYLAND AREA, WE HAVE A TRACE
 TO JUST AN INCH, NOT A HUGE
 PROBLEM, BUT IF YOU ARE
 TRAVELING, HE TRIED TO COME UP
 THROUGH SOUTHERN MARYLAND UP 5
 OR 301, IN THE CHARLES COUNTY,
 DURING THE MORNING IT WILL BE
 BAD.
 SNOWFALL, 2.8, 2.4, THE
 COMPUTERS HAVE COME INTO OUR
 WAY OF THINKING.
 HERE WE GO, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
 OF MOISTURE.
 MOST OF THIS IS RAIN AND A
 LITTLE BIT OF SNOW POPPING UP
 IN NORTHWESTERN NORTH CAROLINA
 IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THIS IS ON
 SCHEDULE FOR BEING ON EITHER
 SIDE OF 6:00 TOMORROW.
 I LIKE DOING A PURE SNOW ON THE
 METER.
 BECAUSE IT WILL BE IMPACTFUL
 AND DISRUPTIVE, WE WILL MAKE IT
 A FIVE.
 IT WILL BE A LEGITIMATE STORM
 BETWEEN THE SNOW AND ICE AND I
 THINK IT WILL BE PLIABLE AND
 SLIDABLE.
 OUT TOWARDS I-81, ISOLATED
 POWER OUTAGES, OKAY, AND
 FURTHER WEST FROM HAGERSTOWN
 INTO CUMBERLAND, WHERE YOU HAD
 THE ICE ABOUT A WEEK AGO, WE
 COULD SEE SCATTERED POWER
 OUTAGES AND WE ARE A LITTLE
 MORE CONCERNED ABOUT POWER
 OUTAGES OVER THERE AND HERE IS
 WHY.
 THIS MODEL HAS VERY LITTLE ICE
 AROUND THE METRO AND IT HAS
 OKAY AMOUNTS, IT COULD PROBABLY
 HANDLE 2/10 IN ROMNEY.
 THIS MODEL IS WAY AGGRESSIVE
 WITH ALMOST AN INCH IN
 CUMBERLAND AND HAGER AND
 OAKLAND AND EVEN MORE, .3 IN
 LEESBURG AND GAITHERSBURG
 LEADING TO LIMBS COMING DOWN
 AND POWER OUTAGES.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT TYPES OF
 PRECIPITATION, IT IS SNOW AND
 EVERYTHING IS COLD AND IT
 STARTS THAT WAY BUT IT DOESN'T
 STAY THAT WAY.
 IT ENDS UP WITH A WARM WEDGE
 AND THAT TURNS THINGS TO SLEET
 WHICH BOUNCES AND THEN WE SEE A
 TURN TO FREEZING RAIN AND THAT
 IS LIQUID AND FREEZES ON
 CONTACT.
 THAT IS THE WORST CASE
 SCENARIO.
 THE ROADS ARE WORSE 6 AM TO
 NOON AND IT KICKS TO A MIX AND
 RAIN OVERNIGHT AND THEN MORNING
 SHOWERS WITH 50s BY THURSDAY.
 33 WITH SNOW AT 6 AM, MODERATE
 TO HEAVY AT 9:00 AND THINGS
 BEGIN TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT
 INTO A MIX.
 THE RED WEATHER ALERT TOMORROW,
 32 AND 56 ON THURSDAY AND LOOK
 AT FRIDAY, WHAT A WAY TO FINISH
 THE WEEK.
 A LITTLE BIT OF A BLIP ON
 SATURDAY, 56 WITH RAIN AND THEN
 66 ON SUNDAY.
 FOUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES
 AND ANNIVERSARIES HAVE PASSED
 SINCE TIM GIMBEL AND HIS LITTLE
 GIRL LOST HER FAMILY.
 IT WAS TWO WEEKS BEFORE
 CHRISTMAS IN 2014, PLANE
 CRASHED INTO THEIR GAITHERSBURG
 HOUSE, AND INSIDE WAS MARIE,
 HOME ON MATERNITY LEAVE FOUND
 CRADLING HER SEVEN-WEEK-OLD SON
 AND 3-YEAR-OLD COLE IN AN
 UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.
 INSTEAD OF LETTING THIS DESTROY
 THEM, KEN AND CLARA BELL ARE
 LETTING, ARE REBUILDING A PARK.
 TONIGHT AT 11:00, HERE ABOUT
 THE DESIGN PLANS LITTLE CLARA
 BELL HAD TO HONOR
      My gums are irritated.
   I don't have to worry about   that, do I?
        Actually, you do.
 Harmful bacteria lurk just below the gum line.

 AND NOW WUSA9 SPORTS , BROUGHT TO YOU BY XFINITY.
 WUSA9 SPORTS DIRECTOR
 DARREN HAYNES  HAS SPRING
 TRAINING WITH THE NATIONALS AND
 THREE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW
 ABOUT THEM.
 Reporter: I'M DARREN HAYNES
 AT NATIONALS SPRING TRAINING
 AND HERE ARE THREE THINGS NEED
 TO KNOW, BRYCE HARPER IS NOT IN
 WEST PALM BEACH, THE FREE AGENT
 STILL HAS YET TO SIGN WITH THE
 TEAM.
 THE NATIONALS OFFERED HIM A
 $300 MILLION DEAL OVER 10
 YEARS, THE SAME AS THE PHILLIES
 WHO OFFERED HIM A 10 YEAR
 CONTRACT FOR $310 MILLION.
 HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT HIM ON
 THE TEAM?
 I WANT HIM ON THIS TEAM, AND
 THE GUYS IN THE CLUBHOUSE WANT
 HIM ON THE TEAM, HE'S ONE OF
 THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE GAME
 RIGHT NOW, AND PEOPLE IN AND
 AROUND THIS ORGANIZATION HAVE
 HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO REALLY
 SEE HOW GOOD OF A PLAYER HE IS.
 BUT YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE
 DAY, WE CAN'T BE SITTING AROUND
 WAITING FOR HIM TO WALK THROUGH
 THOSE DOORS.
 HERE IS THE SECOND THING YOU
 NEED TO KNOW, THERE IS ANOTHER
 BIG FREE AGENT OUT THERE.
 OR SHOULD I SAY USED TO BE FREE
 AGENT, MANNY MacHADO SIGNED A
 10 YEAR $300 MILLION CONTRACT
 WITH THE PADRES, WHAT DOES THIS
 MEAN?
 THIS COULD ACCELERATE THINGS
 FOR BRYCE HARPER TO SIGN.
 I SPOKE TO DAVID MARTINEZ WHO
 SAID BRYCE HARPER NEEDS TO
 FOCUS ON WHAT'S BEST FOR HIS
 FAMILY, BUT ALSO HE WILL FOCUS
 ON THE PLAYERS THAT ARE HERE AT
 SPRING TRAINING.
 SPEAKING OF DAVID MARTINEZ COME
 HERE SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T KNOW
 ABOUT HIM.
 HIDDEN TALENT.
 I CAN PLAY THE BALL GOES.
 THESE ARE NOT BONGOS, BUT,
 CAN YOU?
 DO A QUICK TAP?
 SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
 IT IS TOUGH.
 WE LEARNED SOMETHING NEW TODAY.
 COMING UP AT 11:00 TONIGHT,
 WHY WAS TODAY ALMOST LIKE A
 FAMILY REUNION FOR MANAGER
 DAVEY MARTINEZ?
 DARREN WILL BE AT NATIONALS
 SPRING TRAINING IN FLORIDA ALL
 WEEK LONG AND BRING YOU LIVE
 UPDATES ON THE PLAYERS.
 HE IS MISSING ALL OF THIS
 SNOW.
 WHAT A SHAME.
 SPEAKING OF FACEBOOK LIVE,
 HOWARD IS ON THERE IF YOU WANT
 TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS.
 WE SHOW YOU THE SNOWFALL
 MAP AGAIN.
 3 TO 5 NORTH AND WEST AND 1 TO
 3 IN THE METRO AND UP TO AN
 INCH IN THE NORTHERN NECK AND
 SOUTHERN MARYLAND.
 BUT IF YOU ARE DRIVING UP FROM
 SOUTHERN MARYLAND FROM ST.
 MARY'S THROUGH CHARLES COUNTY,
 AROUND 9:00 OR 10:00, IT WILL
 BE BAD.
 IT WILL START TO SNOW QUICKLY
 AND ACCUMULATE QUICKLY AND
 BECOME HEAVY RATHER QUICKLY.
 ONCE WE GET THROUGH THAT, WE
 ARE OKAY.
 56 ON THURSDAY AND 50s ON
 FRIDAY AND 66 ON SUNDAY.
 AS LONG AS HE CAN STAY OFF
 THE ROADS FOR ONE DAY.
 WE WILL BE BACK AT 7:00.
 WE WILL SEE YOU BACK HERE
 AT 11:00.
