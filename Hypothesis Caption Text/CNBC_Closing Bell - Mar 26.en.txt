 FAMILIAR WITH, DO THE PAPERWORK AND MAKE SURE SOMEONE CAN SIGN
 FOR YOU IN THOSE KINDS OF EVENT.
 YOU CAN HAVE A DIGITAL POWER OF
 ATTORNEY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE
 TECH COMPANIES, IF YOU SAY I
 NEED ACCESS --
 TO MY HUSBAND'S OR WIFE'S
 CLOUD ACCOUNT, YOU CAN GET IN.
 AND I FIND ALSO FROM MY OWN
 EXPERIENCE THAT ONE'S OWN POWER
 OF ATTORNEY MAY NOT BE
 SUFFICIENT AT CERTAIN FINANCIAL
 SERVICE COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE
 THEIR VERY OWN SPECIFICALLY
 WRITTEN ONES.
 IS THAT TRUE?
 YES
 CHECK WITH YOUR BANK AND
 BROKERAGE HOUSE TO MAKE SURE
 YOURS COMPLIES WITH THEIR RULES.
 THANKS FOR WATCHING "POWER
 LUNCH.
 IT IS THE FINAL HOUR OF
 TRADE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT TO HOLD A
 KEY TRADE MEETING WITH HOUSE
 REPUBLICANS IN JUST A FEW
 MOMENTS.
 WE WILL BRING YOU ALL THE
 DETAILS.
 CARNIVAL SHARES GETTING
 CRUSHED AFTER EARNINGS
 THE CEO JOINS US.
 AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GET A KEY
 READING ON HOUSING
 KB HOMES REPORTING AFTER THE
 BELL
 "CLOSING BELL" STARTS RIGHT NOW.
 GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME
 TO "THE CLOSING BELL."
 I'M WILFRED FROST ALONGSIDE SARA
 EISEN.
 LET'S CHECK IN ON THE MARKETS.
 WE HAVE LOST STEAM INTO THE
 FINAL HOUR OF TRADE BUT IT'S
 STILL A POSITIVE SESSION,
 UP 0.4% FOR THE MAJOR INDICES.
 S RUSSELL IS 0.8%.
 EVERY SECTOR IS POSITIVE, LED
 HIGHER BY ENERGY, COMMUNICATION
 SERVICES AT THE BOTTOM
 ALL THE FOCUS LATELY HAS BEEN
 ON THE BOND MARKET
 COMING UP, FED FUNDS FUTURES,
 KEY MARKET, SAYING WE MAY SEE A
 RATE CUT FROM THE FED AS EARLY
 AS SEPTEMBER
 FORMER FED GOVERNOR SARAH BLOOM
 RASKIN WILL BE WITH US.
 BOND MARKETS APPEAR TO HAVE
 STABILIZED FOLLOWING A BIG DROP
 FOR THE 10-YEAR AND MIKE SANTOLI
 IS HERE WITH MORE.
 YES, WILF
 LOOKING AT WHAT THE BOND MARKET
 IS DOING, ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST
 WEEK OR SO, YOU LOOK AT ABOUT A
 ONE-MONTH CHART OF THE S&P 500
 AGAINST THE 10-YEAR TREASURY
 YIELD, AND STARTING JUST A FEW
 DAYS AGO WHEN THE 10-YEAR YIELD
 BROKE DECISIVELY BELOW, IT GOT
 STOCKS' ATTENTION.
 BEFORE THAT LOW YIELDS, GOOD
 CREDIT MARKETS OF BEEN
 SUPPORTING STOCK VALUATIONS AND
 BEEN BEHIND THIS RALLY
 IT GOT DOWN TO A LEVEL THAT
 PEOPLE SAID DO WE HAVE TO BE
 CONCERNED ABOUT GROWTH
 LAST THURSDAY, TREASURY YIELDS
 STOPPED FALLING AND WE GOT A
 RALLY.
 FRIDAY YIELDS KEPT GOING DOWN.
 SO THIS SEEMS TO BE THE SEESAW
 THAT WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW.
 TODAY AS WE MENTIONED, WILF, WE
 DID HAVE STABILIZATION IN YIELDS
 BUT NOT A DECISIVE LIFT.
 THEREFORE, WE HAVE A LITTLE
 TENTATIVE RALLY GOING ON RIGHT
 NOW.
 WHAT'S WORKING IN THIS
 ENVIRONMENT IS LONG GROWTH
 STOCKS
 THE BIG CONSUMER MULTI-DECADE
 GROWTH NAMES LIKE NIKE AND
 STARBUCKS HITTING NEW HIGHS AS
 WELL AS SAFETY DIVIDEND PLAYS.
 THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS ARE WE
 OVERSHOOTING A LITTLE BIT?
 IS IT RIPE FOR REVERSAL?
 THERE ARE PEOPLE SAYING THE
 YIELD MOVE LOOKS A LITTLE
 EXTENDED
 YOU SEE BANKS RALLYING TODAY,
 PERHAPS ANTICIPATING A LITTLE
 BIT OF THE FACT THAT MAYBE
 THINGS SHOULD UNWIND.
 AND OBVIOUSLY GOOD TO SEE THE
 BANK REBOUND TODAY
 THAT'S NOT BEEN A TREND OF LATE.
 THE OTHER TREND OF LATE AS WE
 DISCUSSED YESTERDAY IS THAT ODD
 BALANCE BETWEEN THE LIKES OF
 UTILITIES AND THE LIKES OF THE
 BIG TECH STOCKS THAT CONTINUES
 AGAIN TODAY.
 IT DOES CONTINUE TODAY.
 SO IT'S NOT THE BANKS BOUNCING
 AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHER
 SECTORS THAT HAD BEEN WORKING
 MAYBE IT'S A QUARTER ENDING
 ISSUE.
 OF COURSE TODAY IS THE LAST DAY
 TO BUY BEFORE FUNDS CLOSE THE
 BOOKS ON THE QUARTER
 SO IT COULD BE PEOPLE JUST
 RIDING THE MOMENTUM AND SOME OF
 THOSE GOOD GROUPS AND BRACING TO
 SEE WHAT THE BOND MARKET DOES
 NEXT TO GIVE SOME KIND OF
 SIGNAL
 IS YOUR UPSHOT HERE THAT WHEN
 IT COMES TO STOCKS AND ACTING AS
 A PRESSURE POINT FOR STOCKS,
 IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT THE SWEET
 SPOT THE BONDS HAVE TO BE IN
 YES
 IT'S THE LEVEL AND THE SPEED
 WITH WHICH YOU GET THERE
 IF IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A
 BUYING PANIC IN TREASURIES, THAT
 SEEMS LIKE A RISK OFF MOVE OR
 PEOPLE POSITIONING AGGRESSIVELY.
 VERY ACCOMMODATIVE CENTRAL
 BANK ECONOMY STIMULATES.
 AND A LOT OF THE TECHNICAL
 ANALYSIS WHEN THE YIELD CURVE
 INVERTS EVEN THOSE SAY DOWN THE
 LINE THIS IS A BAD OMEN.
 IT'S A LONG LEAD TIME BEFORE
 YOU TYPICALLY HAVE A RECESSION
 IN THE INTERIM IT GIVES A LIFT
 TO CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY AREAS
 LIKE HOUSING AND AUTOS.
 WE'LL SEE WITH KB HOMES
 REPORTING AFTER THE BELL
 WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN AS FED
 FUND FUTURES SHOW A RATE CUT AS
 EARLY AS SEPTEMBER
 JOINING US IS SARAH RASKIN
 THANKS FOR JOINING US.
 HAPPY TO BE HERE.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING OUT
 SAYING A CUT WOULD BE THE NEXT
 MOVE RATHER THAN A HIKE.
 WHERE DO YOU STANDING AT THE
 MOMENT
 IT'S A REALLY TOUGH CALL AT
 THIS POINT, BUT AS YOU SAW,
 THERE IS REALLY WEAKENING DATA
 COMING IN, PRIMARILY FROM THE
 ECB.
 YOU SAW THE ECB ACTUALLY JUST
 RECENTLY DO SOMETHING THAT
 INDICATED THAT IT WAS -THAT IT
 WAS FORESEEING A SLOWDOWN.
 TOOK SOME PRETTY DRAMATIC
 ACTION
 THE FED SO FAR HAS STAYED PUT
 AFTER REALLY DOING A U-TURN AND
 A MAJOR PAUSE, BUT WEARY NOW AS
 TO WHETHER THE FED IS GOING TO
 BEGIN DOING SOME CUTS.
 HOW CLOSELY DOES THE FED
 ITSELF PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE
 MARKET IS FACTORING IN IN TERMS
 OF A CUT
 WELL, THE FED HAS TO TAKE
 THAT INTO ACCOUNT, FRANKLY
 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE FED
 REALLY KEEP ITS PULSE ON HOW
 MARKETS ARE INDICATING, YOU
 KNOW, WHAT THEY ARE FORESEEING
 IN TERMS OF WHERE THE ECONOMY IS
 GOING.
 THERE'S OTHER DATA TOO, OF
 COURSE, NOT JUST WHAT IS COMING
 IN THROUGH MARKETS, BUT WHAT'S
 COMING IN THROUGH REAL ECONOMIC
 DATA, SLOWING DEMAND, WHAT
 EXPORT/IMPORT NUMBERS ARE
 LOOKING LIKE
 ALL OF THOSE DATA POINTS ARE
 GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AS WELL.
 THE YIELD STABILIZATION OF
 THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, DID YOU
 THINK THAT MARKS THE LOW OF THE
 YIELDS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE
 HARD TO SAY, WILF
 IT IS CERTAINLY ONE INDICATOR
 THAT IS POINTING IN A DIRECTION
 OF THINGS SLOWING DOWN
 THOSE, AS YOU KNOW, HAVE BEEN
 INDICATORS THAT HAVE POINTED IN
 VERY MANY CASES TO THE ONSET OF
 SLOWDOWNS AND RECESSIONS.
 SO THE FED EXPECTS GROWTH TO
 BE 2.1%, WHICH IS LOWER THAN IT
 WAS, BUT IT'S NOT TERRIBLE, IT'S
 NOT RECESSIONARY
 DO YOU THINK ODDS ARE IT'S GOING
 TO COME IN BETTER OR WORSE THAT
 THAT
 I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT'S THE
 HIGH MARK.
 YOU CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE MAYBE TRYING TO
 THINK OF SOME MORE SUGAR HIGHS
 HERE THAT COULD ACTUALLY BOOST
 IT
 I THINK THAT COULD BE KIND OF
 DANGEROUS, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
 THE TRUTH.
 THESE KIND OF SHORT-TERM KINDS
 OF STIMULUS MEASURES CAN BE
 GREAT IN THE SHORT TERM BUT NOT
 BE VERY GOOD AT ALL FOR THE LONG
 TERM
 WE HAVE SEEN THERE'S A DRAG
 COMING OUT
 IT WAS GREAT FOR A WHILE BUT IT
 WAS ONLY GOING TO BE SOMETHING
 SHORT TERM AND NOW YOU SEE THAT
 IT'S PRETTY MUCH OVER.
 DO WE KNOW THAT FOR CERTAIN
 ALREADY?
 COULD THIS BE A FACTOR OF Q1
 SLOWDOWN OR ALL SORTS OF
 FACTORS, LIKE THE SHUTDOWN, ET
 CETERA, ET CETERA.
 CLEARLY Q1 NUMBERS WERE LOW
 IN PART BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN,
 BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO SUGGEST
 THAT THERE'S MUCH LEFT COMING IN
 TERMS OF THE TAX STUFF
 IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT REFUNDS,
 REFUNDS COMING IN HAVE BEEN AT
 ALL-TIME LOWS.
 SO THAT IS A SIGNAL THAT THIS
 TAX BILL HAS PRETTY MUCH RUN ITS
 COURSE.
 WHAT ABOUT THE LATEST NOMINEE
 TO THE FED BOARD FROM PRESIDENT
 TRUMP, STEPHEN MOORE
 THERE'S BEEN INTENSE BACKLASH
 FROM THE RIGHT AND LEFT IN THE
 ECONOMICS WORLD TO THIS
 NOMINATION.
 YES, INDEED
 THIS HAS GOT TO BE WATCHED
 BECAUSE IF THE FED LOSES
 CREDIBILITY BY SEATING PEOPLE
 THAT IN ESSENCE ARE MORE
 POLITICAL THAN OBJECTIVE, I
 THINK YOU RUN SOME BIG RISKS
 IT'S ONE THING TO BE PUTTING
 YOUR POLITICAL FRIENDS AND
 CRONIES WITHIN THE AGENCIES, BUT
 TO PUT THEM ON THE BOARD OF THE
 CENTRAL BANK IS SOMETHING THAT
 IS -THAT HAS TO BE DONE VERY,
 VERY CAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE THE
 MOMENT THE FED LOSES
 CREDIBILITY, IT'S ALMOST GAME
 OVER.
 HAVING A BROAD RANGE OF VIEWS
 ACROSS A COMMITTEE OR A BOARD IS
 ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN ANY WALK OF
 LIFE
 WHAT MAKES YOU SO CONFIDENT THAT
 MR. MOORE WOULD TAKE HIS ROLE AS
 A POLITICAL ONE AND NOT ONCE IN
 POSITION ASSESS THE DATA WITH
 HIS WAY OF APPROACHING IT?
 YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT, WILF
 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE FED NOT
 SUCCUMB TO GROUP THINK, THAT IN
 ESSENCE YOU HAVE A ROBUST
 DISCUSSION OF DIFFERENT
 VIEWPOINTS
 BUT THE VIEWPOINTS HAVE TO BE
 BASED ON DATA.
 THEY HAVE TO BE BASED ON AN
 ABILITY TO ANALYZE AS
 OBJECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE THE DATA
 COMING FORTH
 AND BY MANY ACCOUNTS, THAT IS
 NOT MR. MOORE'S STRONG POINT
 THE ANALYSIS OF DATA IS
 SOMETHING THAT IS CRITICAL FOR
 THE FED TO BE BOTH INDEPENDENT
 AND TO BE -TO BE MAKING MOVES
 AND COMMUNICATING MOVES THAT ARE
 CREDIBLE.
 SO WE'RE JUST ACTUALLY
 GETTING NEWS ON THE WIRES ON
 THIS
 FROM SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER
 SAYING HERE ON CAPITOL HILL, FED
 NOMINEE STEPHEN MOORE IS ONE OF
 THE REASONS FOR THE LARGE
 DEFICIT.
 ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS CUT TAXES,
 CUT TAXES, CUT TAXES
 THAT'S NOT WHAT THE FED REALLY
 DOES, AS YOU KNOW, SO HOW MUCH
 POWER WOULD HE ULTIMATELY HAVE
 IF HE GETS THROUGH ON THE SENATE
 CONFIRMATION
 JUST HOW BIG OF A DEAL IF IT'S
 ONE SORT OF TRUMP LOYALIST ON
 THE FED BOARD?
 YEAH, I KNOW THE ARGUMENT
 I KNOW IT'S TEMPTING TO SAY, OH,
 WHAT IS JUST ONE VOICE, LET ONE
 VOICE THROUGH THAT MIGHT BE JUST
 A WASTED SEAT.
 THESE ARE IMPORTANT TIMES.
 THE WORK THAT THE FOMC DOES HAS
 TO BE CREDIBLE
 EVERY VOICE MATTERS.
 I WOULD NOT START DOWN THE PATH
 OF SAYING, YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY
 TO GET SORT OF ONE SORT OF
 POLITICAL PUNDIT IN THERE.
 I THINK THIS IS -THIS IS
 DANGEROUS.
 THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT QUITE
 CAREFULLY.
 DANGEROUS IS A STRONG WORD,
 SARAH.
 YEAH.
 JUST LOOK AT SOME OF THE
 ECONOMIC APPOINTMENTS HE'S MADE,
 THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE
 THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM
 COMING IN FOR THE LIKES OF
 SECRETARY MNUCHIN, FOR THE LIKES
 OF GARY COHN AND LARRY KUDLOW.
 ARE ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO YOU
 THINK HAVE FARED POORLY IN THEIR
 JOB?
 DID YOU CRITICIZE ANY OF THOSE
 COMING INTO IT
 YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT WE'VE
 GOT TO DO IS DISTINGUISH THE
 FED.
 THAT IS SOMETHING.
 THE FED IS SACRED
 THE FED IS IN ESSENCE
 INDEPENDENT.
 FOR THAT REASON IT HAS TO DO
 WHATEVER CAN BE DONE TO MAINTAIN
 ITS INDEPENDENCE
 I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE
 SENATORS WHEN THEY DO OVERSIGHT
 TO DO THIS VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.
 THIS IS WHY OVERSIGHT MATTERS.
 AND WE -YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
 IMPORTANT THAT THE OVERSIGHT BE
 DONE WELL.
 THESE FED SEATS DO MATTER.
 SARAH BLOOM RASKIN, THANK
 YOU.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS.
 WE WANT MR. MOORE TO COME
 BACK AND JOIN US
 HE WAS HERE, WHAT, A MONTH AGO
 YEAH, HE WAS GOING TO COME
 ON
 YOU KNOW, HE'S GOING GO THROUGH
 A TOUGH NOMINATION PROCESS
 WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM.
 STILL TO COME, SHARES OF
 CARNIVAL SINKING TODAY AFTER THE
 COMPANY CUT ITS FULL-YEAR
 OUTLOOK.
 WE WILL SPEAK WITH CEO ARNOLD
 DONALD ABOUT THE HEADWINDS
 FACING HIS INDUSTRY.
 AND UP NEXT, RICK WELTS
 JOINS US TO TALK ABOUT THE STATE
 OF THE NBA, HIS NEW TEAM'S
 PRIVATELY FUNDED BILLION DOLLAR
 ARENA.
 WE'RE BACK IN COLEF
 NUS.A UP O
 WELCOME BACK AS CHINA TRADE TALKS DOMINATE
 THE HEADLINES, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 IS MEETING WITH HOUSE
 REPUBLICANS IN A FEW MINUTES TO
 DISCUSS ANOTHER TRADE DEAL
 LET'S GET TO KAYLA TAUSCHE WITH
 THE LATEST.
 Reporter: THE FOUR MONTHS
 SINCE THE THREE COUNTRIES SIGNED
 THIS DEAL, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
 BEEN STRATEGIZING BEHIND CLOSED
 DOORS WITH REPUBLICANS TO FIGURE
 OUT WHAT IS GOING TO BE A
 DELICATE PATH TO PASSAGE IN THE
 COMING MONTHS.
 THE WHITE HOUSE HOSTED SENATE
 REPUBLICANS A COUPLE OF WEEKS
 AGO AND TODAY IN JUST A COUPLE
 OF MINUTES THE PRESIDENT WILL BE
 MEETING WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS
 TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE
 CONCERNS THAT THE PARTY HAS
 ABOUT ELEMENTS OF THE DEAL THAT
 WERE INSERTED TO WIN OVER
 DEMOCRATS BUT ARE GIVING SOME
 REPUBLICANS HEARTBURN AND VICE
 VERSA.
 YOU HAVE STEVE SCALISE, THE MAY
 NOERT WHIP TO TALK ABOUT HOW
 VOTES WILL BE COUNTED.
 YOU HAVE KEVIN BRADY, FORMERLY
 CHAIRMAN, NOW RANKING MEMBER
 AND THEN YOU HAVE
 REPRESENTATIVES FROM STATES LIKE
 WASHINGTON AND TEXAS, SOME OF
 THE MOST TRADE DEPENDENT STATES
 WHERE THE NEW NAFTA DEAL IS
 CONCERNED.
 THE OUTREACH HAS BEEN FAR AND
 WIDE
 EVEN THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
 BEEN TALKING A LOT WITH
 REPUBLICANS, TRUMP'S TOP TRADE
 OFFICIAL HAS ALSO BEEN
 FRATERNIZING WITH DEMOCRATS TO
 SEE WHERE THEY ARE AND TO MAKE
 SURE THEY KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN
 LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTALLY
 FRIENDLY PORTIONS OF THIS DEAL
 AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER HAS MET
 WITH THE ENTIRETY OF THE HOUSE
 DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE.
 HE'S MET WITH THE WAYS AND MEANS
 COMMITTEE.
 HE'S MET WITH THE BLUE DOG
 DEMOCRATS AND THE HISPANIC
 CAUCUS
 SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE OUTREACH
 ON THIS DEAL HAS BEEN VAST, IT'S
 BEEN BIPARTISAN, IT'S BEEN ON
 BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, AND
 IT'S GOING TO RAMP UP IN COMING
 MONTHS, GUYS
 THE UNOFFICIAL DEADLINE FOR THE
 ADMINISTRATION TO GET THIS
 PASSED IS THE BEGINNING OF
 AUGUST WHEN CONGRESS IS GOING TO
 GO OUT FOR A MULTI-WEEK BREAK.
 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT, IT'S
 FULL-FLEDGED CAMPAIGN SEASON.
 KAYLA, IF THEY DON'T
 SUCCESSFULLY SELL IT, DOES THAT
 MEAN WE'LL HEAR THE PRESIDENT
 THREATEN TO PULL OUT OF NAFTA
 AGAIN?
 IT'S SOMETHING THAT SENATE
 REPUBLICANS SPECIFICALLY HAVE
 ASKED THE PRESIDENT NOT TO DO.
 IT'S UNCLEAR WHERE THAT SPECIFIC
 STRATEGY STANDS.
 THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY CAN
 GET THE VOTES OR THEY BELIEVE
 THEY CAN GET THE VOTES FOR THIS
 DEAL AND THAT WON'T BE AN
 OPTION
 REMEMBER, THERE ARE TWO OTHER
 CUP TREES WHO HAVE TO RATIFY
 THIS DEAL TOO SO THE U.S. CAN'T
 NECESSARILY MAKE WHOLESALE
 CHANGES TO IT IN ORDER TO GET
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ONBOARD.
 SO THE DEAL THAT'S ON THE TABLE
 IS THE DEAL THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
 GOING TO BE VOTED ON.
 HOW MUCH FOCUS IS THIS TAKING
 OFF CHINA TALKS, KAYLA
 Reporter: WELL, I THINK THE
 IDEA HERE, WILF, IN TERMS OF
 TIMELINE AND BANDWIDTH AT THE
 OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE
 REPRESENTATIVE IS THAT THERE'S A
 DESIRE TO GET CHINA WRAPPED UP
 IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO BECAUSE
 THE EXPECTATION IS THAT IT'S
 GOING TO BE A FULL FORCE EFFORT
 AFTER THAT, FULL-COURT PRESS ON
 USMCA.
 EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE DIFFERENT
 TEAMS AT USTR NEGOTIATING USMCA
 VERSUS CHINA, A LOT OF THE WHITE
 HOUSE STAFF IS OVERLAPPED THERE
 ON THE TRADE TEAM.
 SO CERTAINLY IT IS TAKING TIME
 AWAY -CHINA IS TAKING TIME
 AWAY FROM USMCA AND VICE VERSA
 IF YOU GET ONE OF THOSE
 SITUATIONS SETTLED, IT DOES
 ALLOW YOU TO PIVOT AND TALK
 ABOUT THE OTHER.
 KAYLA, THANK YOU.
 Reporter: SURE.
 SWITCHING GEARS, STARTING
 THIS FALL THE GOLDEN STATE
 WARRIORS WILL HAVE A NEW HOME.
 MOVING ACROSS THE BAY FROM
 OAKLAND TO THE BRAND NEW CHASE
 CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO.
 CHASE CENTER AND THE SURROUNDING
 DISTRICT COVERS ABOUT 11 ACRES,
 HAS 500,000 SQUARE FEET OF
 OFFICE SPACE
 JOINING US NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE
 DEVELOPMENT AND ITS ECONOMIC
 IMPACT ON THE GOLDEN STATE
 WARRIORS IS THE WARRIORS
 PRESIDENT, RICK WELTS.
 WELCOME.
 THANK YOU
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 SO FIRST FULLY PRIVATELY
 FUNDED STADIUM
 HOW DID THAT COME TOGETHER
 WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT?
 WE MADE THE DECISION THAT WE
 WANTED TO BUILD AN ARENA IN SAN
 FRANCISCO.
 PART OF THE DEAL WHEN YOU WANT
 TO DO THAT IS THERE WOULD BE NO
 PUBLIC MONEY
 SO IT'S A HEAVY LIFT
 IT HASN'T BEEN DONE IN DECADES
 I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT AS A
 FORMULA.
 A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
 WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO BUILD
 ONE OF THESE BUT WE KNEW IT AT
 THE OUTSET AND WE'RE CLOSE TO
 THE FINISH LINE.
 AND THE PARTNERSHIP WITH
 CHASE AS WELL LEADS TO ANOTHER
 INITIATIVE, WHICH IS YOU WANT
 THIS TO BE A CASHLESS STADIUM
 ULTIMATELY.
 OBVIOUSLY PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE
 AN IMPORTANT PART OF CHASE'S
 BUSINESS
 THEIR EXPERIENCE REALLY HERE
 WITH MADISON SQUARE GARDEN IN
 NEW YORK AND THEIR EXPERIENCE IN
 TREATING CUSTOMERS IN ARENAS IS
 SECOND TO NONE, SO WE'VE BEEN
 ABLE TO LEVERAGE OFF OF THAT
 EXPERTISE.
 WE THINK WE HAVE EXCITING THINGS
 TO COME.
 HOW ARE THE FANS DEALING WITH
 IT
 BIG MOVE FROM OAKLAND.
 YOU'VE HAD DIEHARD FANDS DURING
 THE WARRIORS TREMENDOUS RIDE.
 WE SPENT THIS YEAR
 CELEBRATING OUR 47 YEARS IN
 OAKLAND.
 70% OF OUR SEASON TICKET HOLDERS
 HAVE DECIDED TO COME WITH US AS
 SEASON TICKET HOLDERS IN SAN
 FRANCISCO.
 WE LOVE THAT BUILDING, IT'S
 OLDER THAN MADISON SQUARE
 GARDEN
 WE NEEDED A DIFFERENT FACILITY
 TO JN RATE THE KIND OF REVENUES
 WE NEEDED TO BE A COMPETITIVE
 CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM.
 WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS IN THE NBA
 MORE BROADLY GOT RIGHT
 LAST YEAR IT WAS THE RECORD
 FOURTH YEAR IN A ROW THAT
 ATTENDANCES ROSE
 THE STREAMING SERVICE, 63%
 GROWTH
 TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED 25%.
 WHAT'S THE NBA GOT RIGHT THAT
 PERHAPS SOME OF THE OTHER SPORTS
 HAVEN'T CONSISTENTLY DONE IN THE
 LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IN A
 ROW?
 I THINK WE HAVE EXTRAORDINARY
 LEADERSHIP
 ADAM SILVER HAS DONE AN AMAZING
 JOB AS COMMISSIONER.
 I THINK WE'RE TOUCHING SOMETHING
 SOCIALLY WITH OUR AUDIENCE
 I THINK IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT
 THE SOCIAL MEDIA STATS AND LOOK
 AT WHERE OUR AUDIENCE IS, WE'RE
 LOOKING AT THAT REALLY COVETED
 YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC WHO'S REALLY
 RESONATING WITH THE
 PERSONALITIES OF THE PLAYERS AND
 THE TEAMS OF THE NBA
 THAT AND THE FACT THAT I THINK
 OUR INTERNATIONAL PLAY OVER TIME
 IS GOING TO REALLY BE WHAT
 SEPARATES US FROM THE OTHER
 AMERICAN SPORTS LEAGUES.
 WE REALLY DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
 TO TAKE THIS SPORT INTERNATIONAL
 LOW IN WAYS THAT I THINK
 FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL WON'T HAVE
 THAT OPPORTUNITY.
 I'VE SEEN THAT FIRSTHAND WITH
 THE SNEAKERS BUSINESS.
 ON A MORE LOCAL LEVEL, THOUGH,
 HOW MUCH IS THIS THE TEAM OF
 SILICON VALLEY
 HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO THE DNA
 INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.
 I THINK LONG TERM IT'S A BIG
 PART OF OUR PERSONALITY, AND A
 BIG POINT OF WHY PLAYERS AT SOME
 POINT IN THEIR CAREERS HAVE AN
 OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WHEREVER
 THEY WANT, SEE SILICON VALLEY
 AND THE WARRIORS AS AN EXCITING
 PLACE.
 BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE, THEY
 CAN INTERACT WITH EXECUTIVES IN
 SILICON VALLEY AND SOME START TO
 BE INVESTORS.
 ON THAT POINT, BEING
 INVESTORS FROM THE PLAYERS
 CLEARLY STEPH CURRY IS A PIONEER
 GETTING INVOLVED IN THE VR
 WORLD.
 BUT DOES THAT RUB OFF BECAUSE OF
 HIM AND HIS LEADERSHIP BUT ALSO
 WHERE YOU ARE BASED?
 I WOULD SAY EVEN MORON DRAY
 IGUODALA, KEVIN DURANT, HAVE
 TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO
 LEARN ABOUT THESE BUSINESSES AND
 LEARN HOW TO INVEST.
 I THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE AND MORE
 NBA PLAYERS DOING THE SAME
 THING.
 IN TERMS -IN TERMS OF THE
 SOCIAL MEDIA ASPECT, HOW HAS
 THAT CHANGED THE NATURE OF THE
 FANS' INTERACTION BUT ALSO FOR
 THE PLAYERS.
 ARE THERE AREAS WHERE YOU REGRET
 THE LEVEL WITH WHICH THE PLAYERS
 GET INVOLVED
 THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
 THIS IS HOW PLAYERS ACROSS THE
 LEGAL INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
 50 YEARS AGO PLAYERS ON ONE TEAM
 NEVER KNEW PLAYERS ON ANOTHER
 TEAM, AND NOW THEY'RE FRIENDS.
 IT DOES CHANGE THE DYNAMIC
 IT CHANGES HOW TEAMS ARE FORMED,
 HOW THEY THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY
 WANT TO PLAY
 SO I THINK IT'S BEEN A REALLY,
 REALLY BIG FACTOR.
 THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
 YOU BUT THERE'S BEEN AN ODD
 STORY ABOUT BASKETBALL IN THE
 NEWS THIS WEEK WITH MICHAEL
 AVENATTI BEING CHARGED WITH
 EXTORTING NIKE, ALL CENTERING
 AROUND THE AMATEUR LEAGUE AND
 COACHES BEING PAID FOR BRIBERY
 HOW BIG A PART OF THE SPORT DO
 YOU THINK THIS IS THAT
 BASKETBALL HAS TO OVERCOME
 I THINK WE STILL HAVE THINGS
 TO CLEAN UP.
 THE NBA,THE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION,
 THE NCAA, ARE HAVING SUBSTANTIVE
 CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO
 CHANGE THE SYSTEMS SO IT SERVES
 THE STUDENT ATHLETE BETTER
 RIGHT NOW THE THINGS WE'RE DOING
 DON'T REALLY WORK.
 THE ONE-AND-DONE ISN'T WORKING
 GREAT FOR THE COLLEGES OR THE
 NBA.
 THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
 TO DO IT THAT TREATS THE
 STUDENTS LIKE STUDENT ATHLETES
 AND GIVES THEM BETTER
 PREPARATION FOR THEIR CAREERS.
 DOES THAT RAISE THE BAR NOW
 OF EXPECTATION
 WHAT IS NECESSARY?
 WHAT IS A BARE MINIMUM FOR THE
 NEXT THREE OR FOUR SEASONS
 WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT KIND
 OF PRESSURE?
 WOULD WE RATHER NOT HAVE BEEN TO
 THE FINALS FOUR YEARS IN A ROW
 I DON'T THINK SO
 OR WON THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS
 WE LIKE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH, RICK.
 THANK YOU
 STILL TO COME ON THE SHOW,
 DESPITE INCREASED CHATTER ABOUT
 A RATE CUT, ONE STRATEGIST STILL
 SAYS THE FED COULD ACTUALLY
 RAISE RATES IN THE SECOND HALF
 OF THE YEAR.
 SHE WILL EXPLAIN WHY, COMING UP.

 MAYBE HE DOES
 FIRST, ARNOLD, WELCOME
 I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE
 MOVE IN YOUR STOCK PRICE TODAY
 AND WHAT WAS SO SURPRISINGLY
 DISAPPOINTING.
 WHAT HAPPENED HERE
 WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WAS
 DISAPPOINTING.
 WE HAD A BEAT FOR THE QUARTER,
 AS YOU MENTIONED
 WE'VE GOT REVENUE GROWTH
 DESPITE THE CHANGE IN GUIDANCE,
 THE MIDPOINT OF THE GUIDANCE IS
 STILL ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR SO
 WE'RE GOING TO GROW.
 BUT WE DID ADJUST TO REFLECT THE
 NECESSARY CHANGE IN FUEL AND
 CURRENCY
 I THINK THERE'S CONSTERNATION AS
 THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME
 BECAUSE WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY
 BEAT FOR THE QUARTER AND THEN
 HAD DROPS ON THE CALLS,
 SOMETIMES OVERALL MARKET DROPS
 I THINK PART OF IT IS JUST A
 FEAR AMONGST SOME PEOPLE THAT
 THIS IS A CYCLICAL INDUSTRY.
 THEY SEE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY
 COMING ON AND THEY'RE
 ANTICIPATING THAT CYCLE TO TURN
 BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A GOOD RUN.
 BUT WE FEEL THAT -IN FACT WE
 KNOW AND WE PLAN FOR CONTINUING
 EARNINGS GROWTH, SUSTAINED
 EARNINGS GROWTH IN THE YEARS TO
 COME, DOUBLE DIGIT, AND ELEVATED
 RETURN ON INVESTMENT CAPITAL
 WHICH IS ALREADY DOUBLE DIGIT.
 BUT HAVE BOOKINGS BEEN A BIT
 SOFTER THAN YOU'D HOPED SO FAR
 THIS QUARTER
 WAS THAT ANOTHER FACTOR?
 NO, WE SEE NO WEAKNESS.
 WE HAVE CAPACITY INCREASE,
 BOOKINGS HAVE BEEN STRONG.
 IN FACT WE HAVE LESS VOLUME TO
 BOOK NOW THAN WE DID LAST YEAR
 AND THAT'S WITH CAPACITY
 INC
 INCREASE
 SO WE'RE AHEAD ON BOOKINGS
 WE'RE DOING VERY WELL, IT'S JUST
 THIS CONSTERNATION AROUND
 LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR YIELD
 NUMBER AND THIS FEAR, I BELIEVE,
 THAT THE BUSINESS IS CYCLICAL
 AND NOT SEEING A YIELD NUMBER IN
 THE FACE OF THE CAPACITY
 INCREASE REINFORCES SOME OF THE
 PERCEPTIONS THAT SOME PEOPLE
 HAVE
 BUT THE REALITY IS WE'RE GOING
 TO DELIVER AND WE BELIEVE WHEN
 WE DELIVER, THE VALUE WILL
 ACTUALLY BE SHOWN TO THE
 SHAREHOLDERS
 SOME OF THE ANALYSTS ARE
 WARNING ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO
 PRICE ON PRICES IN EUROPE
 SPECIFICALLY AND CITING THAT FOR
 THE UNDERPERFORMANCE OF YOUR
 STOCK VERSUS SOME OF YOUR
 COMPETITORS.
 WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN
 EUROPE
 AGAIN, WE'VE GOT DOUBLE-DIGIT
 CAPACITY INCREASE IN EUROPE.
 EUROPE IS UNEVEN AS AN
 ENVIRONMENT, RIGHT NOW, AS YOU
 KNOW
 BUT OVERALL WE'RE GOING TO GROW
 EARNINGS IN OUR EUROPEAN
 FRANCHISE ACROSS OUR BRANDS IN
 EUROPE
 WE'RE GOING TO GROW EARNINGS
 THIS YEAR DESPITE THE UNEVENNESS
 AND WHAT HAVE YOU.
 AND WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT
 CAPACITY INCREASE.
 SO THE YIELD, WHILE ULTIMATELY
 WE EXPECT IT TO BE FLATTISH YEAR
 TO YEAR, WE'RE GOING TO BE
 GROWING EARNINGS
 IN THE END, IT'S EARNINGS AND
 RETURN ON INVESTMENTCAPITAL
 THAT CREATE THE VALUE FOR THE
 BUSINESS
 AND WE'RE EXCITED.
 WE'VE GOT COSTA, ESMERELDA
 COMING IN.
 CARNIVAL, PANORAMA IS COMING
 LATER AND SKY PRINCESS
 CARNIVAL MARDI GRAS, WHICH ISN'T
 GOING TO BE INTRODUCED UNTIL
 2020 HAS 65,000 GUESTS ALREADY
 PREREGISTERED.
 IT'S THE NEW SHIP THAT WILL HAVE
 THE ROLLER COASTER ON IT
 IT'S A LOT OF FUN, WE'RE DOING
 WELL.
 ARNOLD, VIKING CRUISES HAD
 SOME TROUBLE THIS PAST WEEK,
 INCLUDING AN EVACUATION.
 WHEN YOU SEE ISSUES LIKE THAT,
 DOES IT DRIVE CUSTOMERS TO
 CARNIVAL OR IN GENERAL AWAY FROM
 CRUISE SHIPS ALTOGETHER?
 FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT
 FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION
 THERE.
 OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE ANY
 AFFILIATION WITH VIKING.
 I'M JUST GLAD EVERYBODY -THERE
 WAS NO SERIOUS INJURIES OR
 ANYTHING AND EVERYBODY SEEMS TO
 BE SAFE AND THAT'S THE MOST
 IMPORTANT THING.
 BUT THINGS LIKE THAT FOR PEOPLE
 WHO HAVEN'T CRUISED, IF IT STAYS
 IN THE NEWS FOR A WHILE, IT CAN
 BE A DETRIMENT FOR SOMEONE WHO
 HADN'T CRUISED YET
 FOR PEOPLE WHO CRUISE A LOT, I
 THINK THEY REALIZE WHAT A SAFE
 VACATION EXPERIENCE IT IS AND
 WHAT A SAFE AND SECURE PROSPECT
 IT IS TO BE ON A CRUISE SHIP.
 ARNOLD, STATE OF THE CONSUMER
 2019 VERSUS 2018
 IS IT OUTLOOK SLOWER
 YOU KNOW, WE'RE A GLOBAL
 BUSINESS AND IT CHANGES EVERY
 YEAR AROUND THE WORLD.
 BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I WOULD
 SAY THINGS ARE POSITIVE FOR US
 WITH CONSUMERS
 OUR ONBOARD REVENUES, WHICH
 WOULD BE ONE INDICATOR OF THAT,
 OUR ONBOARD REVENUES ARE UP
 NICELY IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
 WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE CONTINUED
 STRENGTH IN THAT THROUGH THE
 REST OF THE YEAR ACROSS THE
 BOARD, WHETHER IT'S IN EUROPE OR
 IN CHINA OR HERE IN THE U.S.
 SO RIGHT NOW WE STILL SEE THINGS
 POSITIVE
 WE'RE A LITTLE RECESSION
 RESISTANT, SO EVEN IF RECESSION
 HITS, WE'RE SUCH A MUCH BETTER
 VALUE THAN THE LAND-BASED
 VACATION THAT WE'RE STILL A GOOD
 PLACE TO GO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE
 LOOKING FOR A GREAT TIME, A
 GREAT EXPERIENCE AND WONDERFUL
 MEMORIES.
 ARNOLD, I DON'T GET IT.
 I'M HAVING A LITTLE DEJA VU
 BECAUSE YOU JOINED US AT THE END
 OF DECEMBER.
 THE STOCK TOOK A BIG DIP AND YOU
 CAME ON SAYING THE BUSINESS IS
 GREAT, EVERYTHING IS FINE, WALL
 STREET IS OVERREACTING
 IT LOOKS LIKE THE STOCK HAS
 FALLEN ON THE DAY YOU REPORTED
 THE LAST FIVE QUARTERS
 WHERE'S THE DISCONNECT COMING
 FROM BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
 AND HOW WALL STREET IS REACTING?
 I BELIEVE -I WISH I KNEW
 FOR CERTAIN, BUT I BELIEVE THE
 BIG DISCONNECT IS THERE IS A
 LATENT FEAR THAT THE CYCLE WILL
 TURN
 THAT WE'VE BEEN ON A NICE, LONG
 RUN AND THE CYCLE WILL TURN.
 THEY BELIEVE THE BUSINESS IS
 CYCLICAL
 EACH QUARTER IT'S A DIFFERENT
 THING THAT THEY POINT TO TO
 CAUSE THEM CONSTERNATION AS WE
 CONTINUE TO GROW OUR EARNINGS
 AND CONTINUE TO BEAT THE
 GUIDANCE
 AND I THINK IT'S JUST THIS
 LATENT CONCERN
 THIS PARTICULAR TIME WE DID
 LOWER GUIDANCE BECAUSE OF FUEL
 AND CURRENCY, ALTHOUGH THE
 GUIDANCE IS STILL FOR AN
 IMPROVED EARNINGS PICTURE VERSUS
 THE PRIOR YEAR
 AND WE HAVE A LOW YIELD
 FORECAST, WHICH AGAIN WE'VE GOT
 NINE BRANDS.
 THAT'S A LONG STORY I WON'T
 BOTHER GOING INTO IT
 BUT THIS WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELD
 THING.
 SO THEY POINT TO THOSE AND IT
 MAKES THEM NERVOUS, OBVIOUSLY.
 BUT I THINK AS LONG AS WE
 PERFORM ULTIMATELY FOR THOSE
 SHAREHOLDERS THAT ARE LONG-TERM
 INVESTORS, THEY'RE GOING TO BE
 HANDSOMELY REWARDED AND THE
 OTHERS WILL COME IN AS THEY'RE
 CONVINCED THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING
 IS TRUE, WHICH IS WE WILL HAVE
 SUSTAINED EARNINGS GROWTH AND
 RETURN ON INVESTMENT CAPITAL.
 ARNOLD, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
 ARNOLD DONALD, CEO OF CARNIVAL.
 YOU'RE NOT ASKING ABOUT THE
 TIME CHANGE?
 YOU REALLY SHUT IT DOWN
 EARLIER.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO MOVE
 ON
 IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT.
 THEY'RE CROSSING TIME ZONES THAN
 HAVING DAYLIGHT SAVINGS, SO IT
 WOULDN'T HAVE QUITE BEEN THE
 RIGHT QUESTION.
 WE HAVE 20 MINUTES LEFT OF
 TRADE.
 WE ARE HIGHER BY 0.3% OR SO BUT
 WE HAVE LOST STEAM THROUGHOUT
 THE SESSION.
 MOST OF THE SECTORS ARE
 POSITIVE
 I THINK ONE JUST DIPPED INTO THE
 RED OF LATE.
 SHARES OF BED, BATH AND BEYOND
 SOARING TODAY.
 WHY ACTIVIST INVESTORS ARE

               Okay,      paint a picture for me.
             Uh, well,     this will be the kitchen.
       And we'd like to put       a fire pit out there,
  and a dock with a boat, maybe.
          Why haven't you         started building?
               Well,     Tyler's off to college...
    and Mom's getting older...
         and eventually we       would like to retire.
         Yeah, it's a lot.
    But TD Ameritrade can help    you build a plan for today
           and tomorrow.
              Great.
       Can you help us pour        the foundation too?
     I think you want a house     near the lake, not in it.
        <i> Come with a goal.</i>
        <i> Leave with a plan.</i>
          <i> TD Ameritrade.</i>

 I wanna keep doing what I love,
   that's the retirement plan.

 WELCOME BACK TO "THE CLOSING BELL."
 WE HAVE 17 MINUTES LEFT TO
 TRADE.
 A COUPLE OF INDIVIDUAL MARKET
 MOVERS FOR YOU
 BED, BATH AND BEYOND SOARING ON
 THE REPORT THAT ACTIVIST
 INVESTORS WANT TO REPLACE THE
 COMPANY'S ENTIRE 12-PERSON
 BOARD.
 THE INVESTORS WHO HAVE A 5%
 STAKE IN THE COMPANY CITED THE
 RETAILER'S FAILURE TO ADAPTING
 TO CONSUMERS SHOPPING ONLINE
 BED, BATH AND BEYOND ISSUED A
 STATEMENT SAYING IT REACHED OUT
 TO THE ACTIVIST INVESTORS,
 INCLUDING LEGION PARTNERS ASSET
 MANAGEMENT FOR IDEAS AND
 SUGGESTIONS ON IMPROVING ITS
 BUSINESS BUT DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY
 FEEDBACK FROM THEM WRITING,
 UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE OUR
 DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT WERE
 SEEKING TO ENGAGE IN GOOD FAITH,
 IT APPEARS THAT THE LEGION AND
 MACELLUM REPRESENTATIVES WERE
 MERELY SEEKING INFORMATION TO
 SUPPORT THEIR OWN ATTACK
 SHARES TRADING SHARPLY HIGHER ON
 THIS NEWS, SOME 20%.
 IT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN
 THAT EARLIER ON.
 THE GENERAL TAKE IS THEY THINK
 THERE'S A LOT OF LOW-HANGING
 FRUIT, WHETHER IT'S CUTTING
 COSTS OR MANAGEMENT.
 BUT THE MARKET LIKES IT.
 WE WERE TALKING EARLIER WITH
 MIKE SANTOLI ABOUT RETAIL THIS
 YEAR FACING SORT OF A MOMENT OF
 RECKONING.
 IF YOU HAVEN'T FIXED IT IN THIS
 VERY HEALTHY CONSUMER
 ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'VE HAD IN
 THE LAST YEAR, SOMETHING HAS GOT
 TO GIVE, WHETHER IT'S GAP
 SPLITTING UP ITS BUSINESSES OR
 AN ACTIVIST COMING OVER AND
 PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE TO
 REVAMP A BOARD AND A CEO
 THESE ARE SOME OF THE
 UNDERPERFORMERS.
 RIGHT
 BUT BIG, BIG MOVE IN THE SHARE
 PRICE BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL IT'S
 LOW-HANGING FRUIT.
 THERE'S ONLY A 5% STAKE HERE
 BUT PEOPLE THINK THERE'S EASY
 WORK TO BE DONE.
 I'M WATCHING ON A CONSUMER
 NOTE, McCORMICK BEATING ON
 EARNINGS, MEETING ON REVENUE
 STRONG PERFORMANCE HELPED OFFSET
 THE LIGHTER CONSUMER BUSINESS
 SALES.
 SHARES TRADING UP A LITTLE LESS
 THAN 1% TODAY.
 FRANK'S HOT SAUCE HAS BEEN A BIG
 PART OF THE STORY HERE
 IT HAS BEEN OUTGROWING THE REST
 OF THE FOOD PEERS.
 THE VALUATION HAS REFLECTED
 THAT
 IT'S TRADING ABOUT 26 TIMES
 FISCAL YEAR '20 EARNINGS
 MEDIAN FOOD COMPANY IS JUST
 UNDER 20 SO A LOT OF THE
 STRENGTH IN McCORMICK AND THE
 OUTPERFORMANCE LIKE WE SAW TODAY
 HAS BEEN IN THE STOCK.
 IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING HIGH FLIER.
 A JIM CRAMER FAVORITE AS WELL.
 FRANK'S HOT SAUCE, I HAVEN'T
 TRIED IT YET.
 CHILULA AND FRANK'S ARE LIKE
 STAPLES.
 TRY FRANK'S, YOU'LL LIKE IT.
 UNDER 15 MINUTES HERE BEFORE
 THE CLOSING BELL
 WE'VE GOT A 58-POINT RALLY HERE
 IN THE DOW, SO THINGS HAVE
 COOLED OFF FROM THE TRIPLE-DIGIT
 GAIN WE SAW EARLIER.
 IT WAS AS HIGH AS 279 POINTS
 EARLIER.
 BUT WITHIN THE S&P, MOST OF THE
 GROUPS ARE STILL HIGHER AT THIS
 HOUR, LED MY ENERGY.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, A TOP
 STRATEGIST TELLS US THE TWO
 HOURS OF THE MARKET THAT COULD
 SEE BIG SLOWDOWNS IN THE QUARTER
 AHEAD.
 WE'RE BACK IN A COUPLE OF.

 WELCOME BACK 11 MINUTES LEFT OF TRADE
 WE ARE HIGHER BY A THIRD OF 1%
 JOINING OUR "CLOSING BELL"
 EXCHANGE, LIZ YOUNG AND CNBC'S
 RICK SANTELLI.
 RICK, THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN IN
 SUCH FOCUS OF LATE
 TALK US THROUGH THE MOVES TODAY
 AND THE AUCTIONS WE'VE HAD
 YOU KNOW, I WAS VERY
 IMPRESSED WITH THE SHORT-END
 AUCTION 2-YEAR NOTE YIELDS BUT
 IT SHOULDN'T BE SHOCKING
 INVESTORS, WHY WOULD THEY TAKE
 ALL THE CURVE RISK
 THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE
 SHORTEST MATURITY OF THIS $113
 BILLION IN SUPPLY MAY BE THE
 BEST
 TOMORROW WE HAVE 5s FOLLOWED BY
 7s
 TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
 SPECIFICALLY, THERE'S SOMETHING
 DIFFERENT TODAY ABOUT
 TREASURIES
 THE EQUITY MARKETS AND INVESTORS
 SHOULD GET A LITTLE NERVOUS WHEN
 YOU HAVE THAT FREEFALL IN RATES
 AND I UNDERSTAND IT COORDINATED
 VERY MUCH WITH THE FED,
 ESPECIALLY THE 19th WHEN THEY
 HAD NO ACTION.
 WE WERE AT 2.61 THAT MORNING
 AFTER THE FED'S TWO-DAY MEETING,
 OBVIOUSLY WE'RE IN THE 2.40s
 I THINK IT'S WHETHER IT'S GUN'S
 HOT, WHETHER IT HAS KINETIC
 ENERGY, WHETHER IT'S CONSTANTLY
 MOVING DOWN.
 TODAY WE GRABBED
 WE WERE UP IN YIELDS EARLY AND
 STOCKS AND THE FIXED INCOME
 MARKETS TODAY HAVE SHADOW BOXED
 ALL SESSION, WILF.
 I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.
 I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS THE
 BOTTOM, BUT IT IS THE BOTTOMING
 PROCESS AND WE'LL HAVE TO
 MONITOR, BUT I THINK THE EQUITY
 MARKETS CAN BUILD IF TREASURIES
 AT THE VERY LEAST CAN MAINTAIN
 AND MOVE A BIT SIDEWAYS.
 LIZ, WHICH ALSO BRINGS US TO
 THE OTHER HOT DISCUSSION POINT
 AS OF NOW IN THE BOND MARKET,
 THEY'RE PRICING IN A MORE THAN
 50% CHANCE THAT THE FEDERAL
 RESERVE CUTS INTEREST RATES IN
 SEPTEMBER, A MORE THAN 75%
 CHANCE THAT THEY DO IT BY NEXT
 JANUARY.
 WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR
 STOCKS OF THAT
 WELL, FIRST, I THINK THE
 MARKET IS A LITTLE AHEAD OF
 ITSELF AND WE SEE A POSSIBILITY
 FOR A RATE HIKE STILL LATER THIS
 YEAR
 I MEAN THE FED REALLY PIVOTED
 SINCE LAST YEAR UP UNTIL THIS
 YEAR
 THEY CAN PIVOT AGAIN
 IF DATA STAYS STRONG AND THE
 U.S. CONSUMER STAYS STRONG, WE
 STILL SEE A CHANCE FOR THEM TO
 COME BACK TO THE TABLE
 THE IMPLICATIONS TO STOCKS IF
 THEY CUT LATER THIS YEAR, IF THE
 MARKET IS NOT EXPECTING THAT,
 THEY'LL THINK THE FED KNOWS
 SOMETHING WE DON'T AND THAT'S A
 NEGATIVE SIGN.
 HOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT
 YOU'RE POSITIONED RELATIVE TO
 THE MARKET IF YOU THINK WE COULD
 STILL GET A HIKE AND PEOPLE ARE
 MOVING THE OTHER DIRECTION
 IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A BOND
 PERSPECTIVE, WITH YIELDS AS LOW
 AS THEY ARE, WE THINK THE MARKET
 MAY HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE AHEAD
 OF ITSELF.
 SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TIME TO
 CHASE THE CURVE.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE A TON
 MORE DURATION RISK WHICH SOUNDS
 LIKE THE CONSENSUS TODAY
 BUT IN THE STOCK SIDE OF IT, NOT
 THAT YOU WANT TO BE OVERWEIGHT
 RISK ASSETS BUT THE FACT WE
 COULD SEE THEM COME BACK TO THE
 TABLE IN THIS PAUSE TABLE, IT'S
 GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF RISK
 ASSETS
 DO YOU THINK THE FED WILL
 CONTINUE TO BE A PRIMARY DRIVER
 FOR RISK SENTIMENT AND STOCKS
 FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AS IT
 HAS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING PART
 OF THE YEAR?
 THEY HAVE BEEN A PRIMARY
 DRIVER TO POSITIVE RISK
 SENTIMENT IN THE BEGINNING PART
 OF THE YEAR.
 THE SECOND QUARTER WILL BE
 REALLY TOUGH FOR EVERYBODY
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EARNINGS
 COME IN AND RIGHT NOW EARNINGS
 ARE EXPECTED TO BE NEGATIVE

 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GDP GROWTH
 THAT COMES IN A LOT LOWER THAN
 THE FOURTH QUARTER SO I THINK
 THE MARKET WILL HAVE TO DIGEST
 THAT
 I DON'T KNOW THAT THE FED CAN
 DRIVE THAT MUCH MORE POSITIVITY
 THROUGH Q2.
 RICK, BACK TO THE YIELD
 CURVES THIS WEEK
 CAN WE REDUCE OUR FOCUS THAT HAS
 BEEN SO HIGH OF LATE ON
 INTERNATIONAL YIELD?
 THE CURVE HAS BEEN MOVING A
 LITTLE BIT MORE ON ITS OWN THIS
 WEEK, HAS IT NOT
 A LITTLE BIT.
 I THINK WE'LL PAY A WHOLE LOT
 MORE ATTENTION TO OVERSEAS
 INVESTORS' BEHAVIOR IN LIEU OF
 THE FACT THAT THEIR CENTRAL
 BANKS MISSED A COUPLE OF
 OPPORTUNITIES.
 EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH
 THAT, NOBODY IS GOING TO
 DISAGREE THAT NOW IS NOT THE
 TIME FOR MARIO DRAGHI TO BE
 STEPPING OUT OR MR. CARNEY
 SO I THINK THE ANSWER IS THERE'S
 GOING TO BE ONGOING PRESSURES.
 ONE THING LIZ SAID I ABSOLUTELY
 AGREE ON, LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
 LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD IN FED
 FUND FUTURES, I HARKEN BACK
 FOUR, FIVE, SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN
 ALL THE TIGHTENING'S WERE BUILT
 IN
 THE PROBLEM WITH FED FUND
 FUTURES AS A BAROMETER IS THAT
 IT REALLY ONLY WORKS AS A GOOD
 PERCENTAGE, A GOOD CALL FOR THE
 NEXT MEETING WHEN YOU'RE THREE
 OR FOUR WEEKS FROM THE NEXT
 MEETING AND ONLY THE CONTRACT
 THAT COVERS THE MEETING.
 JUST THINK, IT'S NOT MUCH
 DIFFERENT THAN THE STOCK MARKET.
 IT LOOKED A LOT BETTER IN AUGUST
 THAN IT DID IN OCTOBER AND
 NOVEMBER
 I WOULD THINK THE SAME COULD BE
 SAID FOR FED FUND FUTURES.
 IN THE END IT'S A ONE MONTH SORT
 OF BILL KCONTRACT
 AND WHAT IT SAYS WAY DOWN THE
 ROAD DOESN'T FORETELL THE FUTURE
 LIKE THE NEAREST CONTRACT MONTH.
 THE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT
 OUT IS THAT OIL PRICES ARE
 JUMPING 2%
 WTI JUST CROSSING BACK ABOVE $60
 A BARREL
 DOES THAT INFLUENCE YOUR SECTOR?
 IT'S A POSITIVE SIGNAL.
 IF YOU SEE DEMAND COME BACK INTO
 COMMODITIES, IT'S ANOTHER SIGNAL
 THAT DEMAND IS HEALTHY IN THE
 ECONOMY, WHICH IS GOING TO MAYBE
 SURPRISE US ON THE UPSIDE
 THROUGHOUT THE SECOND HALF.
 LIZ, THANKS FOR JOINING US.
 THANK YOU.
 ICK, AS ALWAYS, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 UP NEXT, WE'LL BE BACK WITH
 THE CLOSING COUNTDOWN.
 JUST FIVE MINUTES LEFT TO TRADE.
 AND ON THE HEELS OF WEAKER
 HOUSING DATA THIS MORNING, WE'LL
 GET EARNINGS RESULTS FROM KB
 HOME AFTER THE BELL.
 IT'S UP AROUND 25% SO FAR THIS
 YEAR

 So, recently my son's band was signed by a record label.
          A record deal?          Unbelievable.
  Whenever we're about to get  on a stage for a huge audience,
      I always give my dad, like,      a FaceTime kinda moment.
 You see the crowd, you see the emotion.
 You know, he has that experience   for the first time with me,
        and that's really         important to me.

 SHARES OF APPLE NEAR SESSION LOWS FOLLOWING A PATENT RULING
 INVOLVING QUALCOMM, HELPING THE
 DOW LOSE SOME STEAM TODAY.
 JOSH LIPTON WITH MORE IN SAN
 FRANCISCO.
 WHAT'S THE STORY HERE, JOSH.
 SARA, WE WANT TO CALL YOUR
 ATTENTION TO APPLE WHICH IS NEAR
 THE LOWS OF THE SESSION.
 QUALCOMM IN THE GREEN HERE
 A TRADE JUDGE, A JUDGE WITH THE
 ITC, HAS MADE AN INITIAL RULING
 SAYING APPLE DID INFRINGE ONE
 QUALCOMM PATENT.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS JUDGE WILL
 RECOMMEND A LIMITED IMPORT BAN
 ON SOME iPHONE MODELS.
 THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY.
 THE FULL ITC COMMISSION HAS TO
 REVIEW THIS DECISION
 REMEMBER, THIS IS JUST ONE OF
 TWO CASES QUALCOMM BROUGHT TO
 THE ITC.
 THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO
 RELEASE ITS FINAL DECISION ON
 THE OTHER CASE LATER TODAY
 IN THAT ONE LATE LAST YEAR, THE
 ITC JUDGE ALSO SAID APPLE HAD
 INFRINGED A QUALCOMM PATENT BUT
 THAT JUDGE DID NOT RECOMMEND A
 INJUNCTION SO WE'RE WAITING TO
 SEE WHAT THE FULL ITC COMMISSION
 HAS TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
 BIGGER PICTURE, THESE TWO HAVE
 BEEN BATTLING FOR TWO YEARS.
 QUALCOMM GOING AFTER APPLE FOR
 PATENT INFRINGEMENT.
 SARA, BACK TO YOU.
 ALL RIGHT, JOSH, THANK YOU.
 WILFRED, OVER TO YOU ON THE
 FLOOR.
 LET'S START WITH THE S&P 500.
 IT WAS A PICTURE LOSING IMPETUS
 THROUGHOUT THE SESSION BUT A
 NICE TICK-UP FOR THE FINAL HOUR
 OF TRADES LEAVES US WITH THE
 FOUR INDICES UP A LITTLE MORE
 THAN HALF A PERCENT.
 THE RUSSELL IS UP NEARLY A FULL
 PERCENT.
 THE S&P UP 0.7%.
 I'M GOING TO GET TO BOB PISANI
 AND THE SECTORS CHART.
 EVEN THOUGH WE'RE OFF THE HIGHS
 OF THE DAY, ALL THE SECTORS IN
 POSITIVE TERRITORY.
 AT LEAST THE YIELDS WERE NOT
 DOWN AGAIN
 BANKS WERE UP TODAY.
 THAT'S POSITIVE.
 ENERGY, LOOK, $60 OIL HERE,
 THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE HIGHS FOR
 THE YEAR
 SO ENERGY STOCKS DID WELL.
 WE GOT THAT LOUSY HOUSING NUMBER
 EARLY ON TODAY FOR FEBRUARY AND
 ALL THE HOME BUILDING STOCKS,
 YOU SEE NICE MOVES UP 2% AND 3%.
 THIS IS OTHER THAN UTILITIES THE
 BEST-PERFORMING OUT THERE.
 THERE GOES THE BELL
 THAT NICE LITTLE RUN-UP LEAVES
 US EXACTLY A PERCENT HIGHER ON
 THE RUSSELL, WHICH IS THE
 OUTPERFORMER TODAY
 DOW AND S&P UP MORE THAN HALF OF
 1%, SO A DECENT SESSION.
 THAT DOES IT FOR THE FIRST HALF
 OF "CLOSING BELL."
 SARA, BACK TO YOU.
 WELCOME TO "CLOSING BELL."
 I'M SARA EISEN
 WILFRED FROST REJOINING ME IN
 JUST A MOMENT AS WELL AS MIKE
 SANTOLI AS ALWAYS.
 TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE
 FINISHING UP THE DAY ON WALL
 STREET
 THE DOW CLOSING UP ABOUT HALF A
 PERCENT, SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE
 OF THE RANGE OF WHERE IT'S BEEN
 ALL DAY.
 GOT AS HIGH AS 279, AS LOW AS UP

 IT GAINED 140 POINTS
 DIDN'T HELP THAT APPLE TURNED
 LOWER ON THAT QUALCOMM NEWS JOSH
 JUST REPORTED.
 THE S&P 500 GAINING
 THREE-QUARTERS OF A PERCENT.
 ENERGY AND FINANCIALS IN THE
 LEAD
 MORE THAN 1% GAINS APIECE.
 TECHNOLOGY HAD A COMEBACK DAY,
 UP 0.7 OF 1%
 AND THE RUSSELL UP A FULL
 PERCENT.
 HERE ARE THE STORIES ON OUR
 RADAR.
 TECH STOCKS DID OUTPERFORM THE
 DOW BUT COMPANIES BRACING
 INVESTORS FOR WHAT COULD BE THE
 WORST QUARTER FOR TECH IN MORE
 THAN SIX YEARS.
 AND WE'LL GET A READ ON
 HOUSING WHEN KB HOMES REPORTS IN
 JUST A FEW MINUTES.
 FIRST JOINING US TO TALK
 ABOUT THE MARKET TODAY, TONY
 DWYER.
 MIKE, A PRETTY STRONG SESSION.
 IT WASN'T AS STRONG AS IT LOOKED
 EARLIER THIS MORNING, BUT IT
 FELT LIKE IT WAS KEY THAT YIELDS
 STABILIZED.
 IT WAS.
 IN THE MORNING THAT SORT OF
 RELEASED THE MARKET HIGHER
 AND I THINK REALLY WE PEAKED ON
 THE DAY IN TERMS OF THE STOCK
 INDEXES WHEN THOSE YIELDS ALSO
 HIT THEIR HIGHS OF THE DAY SO
 WE'RE KIND OF TETHERED FOR THE
 MOMENT
 WE'LL SEE IF THIS CONTINUES FOR
 A WHILE.
 MORE BROADLY, I THINK THE S&P
 500 IS TRYING TO FIGHT THE
 BATTLE OF THIS 2800, THIS TRENCH
 THAT'S BEEN DRAWN IN THE MARKET.
 WE FIRST HIT IT MARCH 1st.
 HERE IT IS MARCH 26th AND WE'RE
 WITHIN 1% OF IT.
 I THINK WE SPENT MOST OF THE
 MONTH HERE
 SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
 CONCLUDE ANYTHING PARTICULARLY
 DECISIVE ABOUT TODAY, ALTHOUGH
 THE BANKS BOUNCING HARD WAS
 PROBABLY WELCOME
 WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY
 FOLLOW-THROUGH AT ALL.
 TONY, DO YOU THINK THE EQUITY
 MARKETS WANT TO SEE THE YIELDS
 STABILIZE A BIT, JUST SOME
 STABILITY SO THEY CAN FIND
 FOOTING AGAIN?
 GOING BACK TO THE LEAD-IN
 STORY ON TECH AND HOW YOU'RE
 GOING TO HAVE THE WORST EARNINGS
 IN SIX YEARS, IT'S BEEN A GOOD
 SIX YEARS DURING THAT TIME SO
 LET'S PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE.
 THE MARKET WANTS TO SEE THERE'S
 NOT GOING TO BE PART OF A
 RECESSION, GIVEN THAT PART OF
 THE YIELD CURVE INVERTED LAST
 FRIDAY
 IT'S LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF
 SIGNS OF GREEN CHUTES FOR
 GROWTH.
 MIKE, GREEN CHUTES FOR
 GROWTH, ARE WE SEEING ENOUGH OF
 THEM TO HAVE SEEN THE MARKET RUN
 UP SO FAR SO FAST THIS YEAR?
 YOU KNOW, I THINK MOST OF THE
 RALLY YOU COULD PROBABLY CHALK
 UP TO THE FED PIVOT, THE FACT
 THAT THE MARKET WAS SO OVERDONE
 ON THE DOWNSIDE.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN RISING
 ON THIS ECONOMY IS ACCELERATING
 OR ABOUT TO ACCELERATE.
 THERE'S SO LITTLE IN THE WAY
 OF DATA.
 VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF
 DATA
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE STOCKS
 WORKING THE BEST, THEY'RE NOT
 NECESSARILY, AT LEAST IN THE
 LAST FEW WEEKS, TETHERED TO HOW
 STRONG THE ECONOMY IS.
 TODAY YOU HAD THIS BACKSLIDING
 IN THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
 INDEX, WHICH I DON'T THINK IT
 SAYS THINGS ARE FALLING APART
 BUT IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO
 DISSUADE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE
 WE'RE IN A PROLONGED SOFT PATCH.
 EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT THE
 YIELD CURVE AND SAYING PART OF
 IT INVERTED.
 A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN BEFORE
 YOU GO INTO A RECESSION.
 CREDIT DELINQUENCIES PICK UP
 THAT'S NOT HAPPENING
 CREDIT STRESS INDICATORS THAT
 MEASURE 105 CREDIT STRESSES AND
 SHADOW BANKING AND THE FINANCIAL
 MARKETS START TO TICK UP
 SIGNIFICANTLY.
 THEY'RE AT A CYCLE LOW
 HOUSEHOLD DEBT SERVICE RATIOS
 PICK UP.
 THAT'S AT A CYCLE LOW.
 ALL THOSE THINGS THAT TYPICALLY
 SHOW UP WHEN A RECESSION IS
 IMMINENT AND A LOT OF TIMES WE
 CHOOSE TO IGNORE ARE SIMPLY NOT
 SHOWING UP
 AS LONG AS THE CREDIT MARKETS
 ARE OPEN AND THEY'RE OPEN,
 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE POSITIVE
 ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.
 ARE THERE ANY ORANGE FLAGS
 OUT THERE, THOUGH?
 WELL, THERE REALLY ISN'T.
 THERE'S THIS IDEA -THE YIELD
 CURVE IS AN ORANGE FLAG IF IT
 STW
 INVERTS.
 YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE A RATE OF
 CHANGE ON SOME OF THE PMIs
 IN 2018 YOU HAD THIS GLOBAL
 SYNCHRONIZED RECOVERY THAT
 EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET WAS
 QUOTING AND YOU WERE BEATING
 THOSE EXPECTATIONS
 TODAY IT'S THE OPPOSITE.
 BUT THE KEY METRIC THAT WE WATCH
 IS CREDIT.
 DO COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS
 HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT, AND THE
 ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY YES RIGHT
 NOW.
 NOW, IT CAN CHANGE QUICKLY, BUT
 THERE'S NO SIGNS.
 SO YOU SAY YOU ARE PERMEABLE.
 ARE YOU STILL OUTFRONT IN THAMES

  -TERMS OF YOUR OUTLOOK?
 WE'RE AT 2950
 SARA, IT'S VERY INTERESTING.
 IF THE FED IS EASING BECAUSE
 ECONOMIC DATA IS SO WEEK AND
 WE'RE IN THIS POLITICAL DRAMA
 AND EVERYBODY IS JUMPING ON THIS
 1995 BANDWAGON, BUT WHEN THE FED
 WENT FROM TIGHTENING FEBRUARY
 1st OF 1995 TO EASING IN JULY OF
 1995, THE MARKET WAS UP 14%.
 IT WENT UP WITH MUCH WEAKER
 ECONOMIC DATA AND FEAR CORPORATE
 PROFITS WOULD BE NEGATIVE.
 TECH OUTPERFORMING THE
 BROADER MARKET AND REMAINS THE
 TOP PERFORMING SECTOR FOR THE
 YEAR, THE QQQ ETF UP 14% FOR THE
 YEAR
 MIKE, IT'S SORT OF DANCING TO
 ITS OWN TUNE
 THE YIELD PICTURE DOESN'T HAVE
 TO INFLUENCE IT IN A WAY YOU
 MIGHT OF THOUGHT IT WOULD IN THE
 PAST.
 IT SEEMS TO ME THE MARKET IS
 SHOWING A PREFERENCE FOR WHERE
 IT CAN RELY ON STRONG CASH
 FLOWS.
 SO MAYBE IT'S JUST THE MUSCLE
 MEMORY, BUT THEY'RE GRABBING FOR
 BIG CAP TECH
 BUT OTHER GROWTH STOCKS AS WELL.
 YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT VISA.
 A LOT OF OTHER KIND OF SECULAR
 GROWTH TYPE NAMES.
 SO THAT IS, I THINK, WHAT'S
 HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
 TECH IS GETTING BIG AGAIN.
 REMEMBER, THEY SPLIT THE SECTORS
 LAST YEAR.
 IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK AND PUT
 FACEBOOK AND ALPHABET BACK IN
 THE TECH SECTOR FROM
 COMMUNICATION SERVGICES, YOU HAE
 A TREMENDOUS COMMITMENT BY THE
 MARKET RIGHT NOW BECAUSE RIGHT
 NOW THAT'S WHERE THE EARNINGS
 CONFIDENCE LIES.
 BUT THIS WAS A GROUP, TONY,
 THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE AND
 INSULATED FROM SOME OF THE MACRO
 HEADWINDS, RECESSION CALLS,
 STRONG DOLLAR.
 WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU NOW THE
 OUTLOOK IS BEING CLOUDED EVEN
 FOR THESE COMPANIES.
 YOU'RE COMING OFF A PEAK FOR
 SEMIS.
 DON'T FORGET HOW BIG CRYPTO WILL
 BE FOR THE SEMIS AND YOU'RE
 HEARING OF DOUBLE ORDERING
 WE'RE COMING OFF OF THAT
 THE QUESTION IS CAN THE MARKET
 CONTINUE TO RALLY IF TECH GOES
 INTO A CONSOLIDATION OR WEAKNESS
 MODE
 AGAIN, I HATE TO DO IT, BUT
 1995, SEMIS UNDERPERFORMED
 SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SECOND HALF
 OF THAT YEAR, SIGNIFICANTLY.
 AND THAT WAS THE GROWTH ARENA.
 SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
 REMEMBER WHAT'S HAPPENING IS
 THAT GROWTH IS SLOWING AND
 OFFSETTING THAT MOSTLY WE HAVE
 HAD 75 BASIS POINT REDUCTION AND
 MARKET DRIVEN RATES.
 SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
 THAT -I ACTUALLY HEARD
 SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT REFINANCING
 TODAY.
 WHEN'S THE LAST TIME WE'VE
 TALKED ABOUT REFINANCING
 IT GOES TO CREDIT AVAILABILITY
 IF THE PEOPLE ON THIS DESK AND
 PEOPLE WATCHING THE SHOW CAN
 CALL UP THEIR MORTGAGE COMPANY
 AND SAY I'D LIKE TO REFINANCE MY
 DEBT AND THEY CAN DO IT, WE'RE
 STILL IN A GROWTH TRAJECTORY
 THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE
 WHAT'S YOUR POINT ON SEMIS,
 WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE
 AS A LEADING FACTOR?
 THEY'RE THE REASON FOR
 DECLINE IN EARNINGS FOR TECH
 HARDWARE AND SEMIS ARE THE TWO
 MAIN CULPRITS.
 AGAIN, YOU'RE COMING OFF OF PEAK
 EARNINGS
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF
 APPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING BACK
 AND FORTH IN THEIR EARNINGS
 ESTIMATES OVER THE LAST THREE
 MONTHS
 AT THE ENDI OF THE YEAR AND INT
 THE FIRST MONTH IT WAS DOWN ON
 THE APPLE PREANNOUNCEMENT AND
 NOW IT'S BACK UP ON THE
 SERVICES
 I THINK IT'S JUST A VERY MIXED
 PICTURE.
 SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU
 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS THE
 BEST PERFORMING SECTOR SO FAR
 THIS YEAR, UP 19%, SHOULD WE
 STICK WITH IT, WHAT DO YOU SAY
 ABSOLUTELY.
 YOU HAVE TO MAKE -TO BE OUT OF
 AN ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE
 SECTOR, YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO
 SAY THAT CREDIT IS SHOWING
 YOU'RE GETTING TOWARD AN
 IMMINENT RECESSION
 YOU'LL HAVE PERIODS -HOW MANY
 PERIODS HAVE WE HAD THIS CYCLE
 WHERE UTILITIES AND CONSUMER
 STAPLES HAVE OUTPERFORMED.
 PEOPLE HAVE SCREAMED THIS IS A
 CHARACTER CHANGE IN THE MARKET
 WHEN THESE DEFENSIVE SECTORS
 OUTPERFORM ONLY TO REVERSE WHEN?
 WHEN INTEREST RATES COME DOWN.
 THAT'S WHAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE
 COURSE OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS,
 MARKET-DRIVEN INTEREST RATES
 COME DOWN TO THE POINT YOU'RE
 ALMOST AT AN INVERTED YIELD
 CURVE.
 TECH COMPANIES ARE LOWERING
 THEIR EARNINGS GUIDANCE AT A
 RECORD RATE.
 26 S&P TECH COMPANIES ISSUING
 NEGATIVE GUIDANCE AHEAD OF FIRST
 QUARTER RESULTS.
 FULL STORY ON CNBC.COM
 A LOT HAVING TO DO WITH THE
 CLOUDY OUTLOOK.
 WELL, IT'S FUNNY YOU SAY THAT
 BECAUSE IT'S SOME OF THE CLOUD
 COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN
 REDUCING THE NUMBERS ALONG WITH
 SEMIS.
 I THINK IT'S IN THE MARKET ONCE
 THE GUIDANCE IS OUT THERE SO
 THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
 YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF
 IT
 IS IT THE BEGINNING OF A
 DOWNSLOPE OR AN ADJUSTMENT THE
 MARKET HAS MADE TO A SLIGHTLY
 LESS INTERESTING EARNINGS GROWTH
 FOR AT LEAST A QUARTER OR TWO.
 RIGHT NOW I LOOK AT THE SOFTWARE
 GROUP, WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO
 WITH APPLE
 IT IS UP MORE THAN 20% YEAR TO
 DATE
 SOFTWARE AND SEMIS BOTH UP 20%
 YEAR TO DATE
 APPLE HAVING THIS NICE RUN
 I DON'T THINK THE MARKET IS
 SITTING THERE SAYING, OKAY, WE
 HAVE TO HUDDLE DOWN BECAUSE TECH
 IS NO LONGER AN EARNINGS STORY.
 TONY?
 I COULD SEE A PULLBACK.
 YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE
 QUARTER WITH EXPECTATION AND
 EARNINGS
 BUT WHAT I'D URGE EVERYBODY TO
 DO, YOU KNOW HOW THE SECOND
 DERIVATIVE IS ONLY TALKING ABOUT
 WHEN THINGS ARE TURNING OVER
 LOOK
 WHEN THEY'RE STARTING TO BOUNCE
 OFF THE LOW.
 THAT'S YOUR TELL THAT YOU'RE
 COMING OUT OF THIS GROWTH
 SLOWDOWN.
 IS THAT HAPPENING
 WHICH COUNTRIES.
 IT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA, IT'S
 HAPPENING IN THE EUROZONE, IT'S
 HAPPENING NEARLY EVERYWHERE.
 I TRACK IT AS THE ASIAN FIVE
 AND THESE INDICES ARE NEGATIVE
 I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE GOOD.
 I THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT
 AND THEN WE GOT THAT GERMAN
 MANUFACTURING NUMBER LAST
 FRIDAY.
 THE ZEW INDEX OF BUSINESS
 CONFIDENCE THAT SURPRISED TO THE
 UPSIDE.
 IT'S AN OPTIMISTIC --
 I AM NOT MAKING THE
 OPTIMISTIC CASE.
 I AM MAKING THE LESS PESSIMISTIC
 CASE
 REMEMBER, EVERYBODY WANTS TO
 SELL WHEN THINGS ARE GREAT AND
 IT'S GETTING LESS GREAT.
 LET'S LOOK TO DO THE SAME WHEN
 THE SIGNS COME OUT AND IT'S LESS
 HORRIFICALLY BAD IN SOME OF
 THESE PMIs
 THE PERCENTAGE OF PURCHASING
 MANAGERS INDEX GLOBALLY THAT ARE
 POSITIVE IS BELOW THE LEVEL OF

 IT'S TRENDING TO 2011.
 THAT'S TYPICALLY NOT WHEN YOU
 WANT TO GET NEGATIVE ON GLOBAL
 ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.
 IS IT THE TIME TO START
 GETTING AGGRESSIVE WHEN IT'S
 LESS BAD NEWS WHEN THE MARKET IS
 ONLY 4% OFF ITS ALL-TIME HIGH?
 IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE AT DEPRESSED
 LEVELS.
 WERE WE AS BAD AS THE GREAT
 DEPRESSION IN THE FOURTH
 QUARTER?
 THERE WAS AN EXCESSIVE DROP IN
 THE FOURTH QUARTER
 I THINK THE DATA THAT CAME OUT
 AND SAID PEOPLE ARE LESS EXPOSED
 TO STOCKS SINCE 2016, I DON'T
 THINK THEY'RE REALLY BULLISH
 YOU'RE NOT A 60% OF NEWS WRITERS
 BULLISH, YOU'RE UP OFF THE LOW
 BUT CLEARLY THEY'RE NOT CHASING.
 PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL OF CHASING.
 WE WANT TO GET TO THIS NEWS
 ALERT ON PATRIOTS OWNER ROBERT
 KRAFT.
 SUE HERERA WITH THE DETAILS.
 SUE.
 THE PATRIOTS OWNER ROBERT
 KRAFT HAS DECIDED THAT HE IS
 GOING TO WAIVE ARRAIGNMENT
 HE IS ENTERING A PLEA OF NOT
 GUILTY TO CHARGES OF SOLICITING
 PROSTITUTION
 HE IS ALSO REQUESTING A JURY
 TRIAL.
 SO HE IS FORMALLY ENTERING A
 PLEA OF NOT GUILTY, WAIVING
 ARRAIGNMENT AND REQUESTING A
 JURY TRIAL
 NOW, YOU MAY RECALL JUST A WEEK
 OR SO AGO FEDERAL -FLORIDA
 PROSECUTORS HAD OFFERED TO DROP
 THE CHARGES AGAINST NOT ONLY MR.
 KRAFT BUT OTHER HIGH-PROFILE
 PEOPLE IF -THERE WAS A CATCH
 TO THAT.
 IF THE MEN AGREED TO ADMIT THAT
 THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND
 GUILTY AT TRIAL, THEN THEY WERE
 ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO DO
 COMMUNITY SERVICE.
 THEY REJECTED THAT PARTICULAR
 OFFER FROM PROSECUTORS AND NOW
 HE HAS ENTERED A PLEA OF NOT
 GUILTY TO CHARGES OF SOLICITING
 PROSTITUTION
 GUYS, BACK TO YOU.
 ALL RIGHT, SUE HERERA, THANK
 YOU FOR THE UPDATE ON THAT ONE.
 GUYS, I WANT TO GET A FINAL
 THOUGHT ON THE MARKETS, TONY
 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TECH
 OUTLOOK.
 LET'S BROADEN IT OUT
 OTHER SECTORS THAT LOOK
 ATTRACTIVE GOING INTO EARNINGS
 SEASON BASED ON
 PREANNOUNCEMENTS
 I THINK THE INTEREST RATE
 SENSITIVE SECTORS ARE CONTINUING
 TO ACT WELL.
 I CAN SEE THE HOME BUILDERS
 DOING BETTER ON LOWER RATES AS
 YOU GET A LITTLE MORE OPTIMISM
 TOWARD SECOND HALF
 BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT
 QUESTION WILF BROUGHT UP
 THINGS ARE NOT GOOD
 INTERNATIONALLY.
 MY POINT IS JUST LIKE THE ZEW
 INDEX, IF THEY'RE JUST TICKING
 UP A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S A LOT
 LESS BAD.
 BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE
 AS WELL.
 VALUATIONS IN EUROPE ARE
 UNBELIEVABLY CHEAP
 THAT DOESN'T APPLY HERE.
 SO A SMALL TICK-UP OR SMALL BIT
 OF DATA THAT'S LESS BAD IN
 GERMANY, DOES THAT CHANGE THE
 OUTLOOK FOR U.S. EQUITIES?
 I'VE NOT YET FOUND ANYBODY
 THAT TRADES THE VALUATION SD
 DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE U.S. FOR
 A LONG TIME.
 IT COMES DOWN TO GROWTH
 EXPECTATIONS
 WHEN YOU'VE GOT LOWER INTEREST
 RATE AND FAVORABLE MONETARY
 POLICY, EMERGING AND HIGHER BETA
 DOES BETTER THAN DEVELOPED AND
 LOWER BETA.
 THANKS VERY MUCH, TONY DWYER.
 DIGITAL AD COMPANY TRADE
 DESK JUST STRUCK A NEW DEAL TO
 TARGET ADS IN CHINA.
 THE CEO WILL GIVE US DETAILS,
 NEXT.
 THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA AND
 PURDUE PHARMA, THE MAKER OF
 OXYCODONE, REACHING A $270
 MILLION SETTLEMENT
 THE COMPANY HAS MORE COSTLY
 LEGAL FIGHTS AHEAD
 WE'LL HAVE THE FULL STORY COMING
 UP.
 YOU CAN REACH OUT TO THE
 SHOW ON TWIR, FATTER, FACEBOOK
 SEND US AN E-MAIL.
 "CLOSING BELL" WILL BE RIGHT
 BACK
 The day after chemo
 might mean a trip back to the doctor's office
         just for a shot.
      But why go back there
      when you can stay home
       with Neulasta Onpro?
   Strong chemo can put you at    risk of serious infection.
     In a key study Neulasta  reduced the risk of infection
         from 17% to 1%,
         a 94% decrease.
    Neulasta Onpro is designed       to deliver Neulasta
       the day after chemo
   and is used by most patients              today.
     Neulasta is for certain         cancer patients
  receiving strong chemotherapy.
  Do not take Neulasta if you're          allergic to it
    or Neupogen (filgrastim).
     An incomplete dose could     increase infection risk.
         Ruptured spleen,
    sometimes fatal as well as      serious lung problems,
       allergic reactions,
  kidney injuries and capillary   leak syndrome have occurred.
   Report abdominal or shoulder   tip pain, trouble breathing
     or allergic reactions to     your doctor right away.
     In patients with sickle         cell disorders,
 serious, sometimes fatal crises            can occur.
   The most common side effect     is bone and muscle ache.
     If you'd rather be home,
      ask your doctor about         Neulasta Onpro.
   Pay no more than $5 per dose         with copay card.
 WELCOME BACK WE'VE GOT AN EARNINGS ALERT ON
 KB HOME.
 KIND OF A MIXED BAG REPORTING
 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE
 OF 31 CENTS.
 THAT ON REVENUE OF $811 MILLION
 VERSUS ESTIMATES OF $831.8
 MILLION.
 AVERAGE SELLING OF A KB HOME
 DOWN 5% TO $370,900.
 THE BIG NUMBER IS THE NEW
 ORDERS
 THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WAS
 WATCHING BECAUSE OF THE SLOWDOWN
 AT THE END OF THE YEAR
 KB HOMES' FIRST QUARTER IS
 DECEMBER, JANUARY, FEBRUARY, SO
 IT WAS WHEN WE SAW MORTGAGE
 RATES REALLY PEAK IN NOVEMBER
 AND THAT DROPOFF
 THE RATES BEGAN COMING DOWN IN
 DECEMBER BUT THE END OF THE YEAR
 WAS ROUGH FOR THE BUILDERS
 NEW ORDERS DOWN 4%
 CEO JEFF METZGER SAID ALTHOUGH
 THE DECLINE IN NET NEW ORDERS
 IMPACTED OUR FIRST QUARTER
 HOUSING REVENUES, WE ARE
 ENCOURAGED BY IMPROVING MARKET
 CONDITIONS WHICH SHOULD ENABLE
 US TO GENERATE STRONGER REVENUES
 IN THE SECOND HALF
 THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE GIVEN MUCH
 LOWER RATES BUT SEEING THE PRICE
 OF A HOME COME DOWN A LITTLE,
 AFFORDABILITY HAS BEEN THE BIG
 STORY IN HOUSING
 WE DID SEE HOUSING STARTS DROP
 OFF IN THE REPORT TODAY FOR
 FEBRUARY WITH BUILDERS SEEING
 WEAKER DEMAND.
 SO AGAIN IT'S KIND OF A BIG
 QUESTION MARKUP IN THE AIR FOR
 THE SPRING SEASON FOR THE
 BUILDERS
 WE DID SEE KB HOMES STOCK REALLY
 SURGE BUT THAT'S PART OF THE
 HOPE TRADE FOR THE BUILDERS.
 THAT PEOPLE BUY INTO THEM ON THE
 EXPECTATION THAT THE STOCK WILL
 INCREASE IF THEY HAVE A GOOD
 SEASON
 BUT SO FAR WE HAVEN'T REALLY
 SEEN THE NEW HOME SALES POP UP
 THE WAY WE MIGHT EXPECT.
 BACK TO YOU GUYS.
 DIANA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
 FOR THAT
 MIKE, THE SHARES CLEARLY
 REACTING
 THE MARGIN WAS PRETTY GOOD
 THE OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR AHEAD
 WILL BE WHETHER FALLING RATES
 LEADS TO NET ORDERS PICKING BACK
 UP AGAIN.
 IF YOU'RE A HOME BUILDER AND
 THE ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE
 ADDRESSED IS BRIDGING THIS
 AFFORDABILITY GAP, THAT'S NOT
 NECESSARILY IDEAL FOR YOUR
 BUSINESS
 IT MEANS EITHER CUTTING PRICES
 OR SOMETHING
 OR OF COURSE RATES GOING DOWN
 HELPS THAT A LITTLE BIT.
 SO IT'S A MIX.
 I MEAN THIS STOCK MADE SUCH A
 PEAK IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR,
 IT'S BEEN FIGHTING ITS WAY BACK
 FROM THE LOWS OFF OF THAT.
 IT'S A CONSTRUCTIVE BUT VERY
 INCONCLUSIONIVE.
 A WINNING STOCK TO TELL YOU
 ABOUT, THE TRADE DESK ANNOUNCING
 A NEW DEAL TO TARGET ADS IN
 CHINA.
 THAT STOCK DOWN 5%, BUT UP
 ALMOST 240% OVER THE LAST 12
 MONTHS
 JOINING US NOW IS JEFF GREEN,
 CEO AND FOUNDER OF THE TRADE
 DESK
 WELCOME.
 THANK YOU.
 WE DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE
 NEW DEAL IN CHINA, BUT WE DON'T
 TALK ABOUT AD TECH EVERY SINGLE
 DAY SO WHAT'S LEADING TO THAT
 GROWTH OVER THE LAST YEAR?
 IT'S BEEN ALMOST 1,000% SINCE
 WE LAUNCHED.
 ADVERTISERS ARE SAYING THEY WANT
 TO PUT THEIR DATA TO WORK AND
 REALIZED THAT THE INTERNET IS
 WAY BIGGER THAN JUST GOOGLE AND
 FACEBOOK
 THEY'RE INTERESTED IN MONETIZING
 THE REST OF IT, NOT THE LEAST OF
 WHICH IS CONNECTED TV AND THE
 REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS MORE
 THAN TWO-THIRDS OF THE
 ADVERTISING PIE.
 SO WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO FOR
 THEM
 BASICALLY IF YOU WANT TO BUY
 GOOGLE, YOU GO TO GOOGLE
 IF YOU WANT TO BUY FACEBOOK, YOU
 GO TO FACEBOOK
 IF YOU WANT TO BUY THE REST OF
 THE ENTRANT, THEY HAND US THEIR
 DATA AND INSIGHT AND SAY SHOULD
 WE BUY SPOTIFY, "THE NEW YORK
 TIMES," MSN OR THIS APP?
 WE USE INSIGHTS ON REPORTING TO
 HELP THEM WHICH OF THOSE THINGS
 TO BUY AND WE MEASURE THE IMPACT
 OF EACH OF THEM ON EACH OTHER.
 AND THESE VARIOUS CONCERNS,
 MOST OF IT FOCUSED ON GOOGLE AND
 FACEBOOK ABOUT THEIR USE OF USER
 DATA AND HOW MUCH ADVERTISERS
 HAVE ACCESS TO, WHERE DO YOU SIT
 IN THAT PROCESS WITH THESE OTHER
 VENUES
 SO WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT FROM
 THOSE TWO COMPANIES IN THE SENSE
 THAT WE DON'T TRACT IN
 PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
 INFORMATION AND YOU DON'T TELL
 ME EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A MEDICAL
 PROBLEM OR SHARE WITH ME YOUR
 ENTIRE SOCIAL NETWORK.
 ALL WE DO IS HELP PEOPLE FIGURE
 OUT WHAT PRODUCTS THEY'RE LIKELY
 TO BE INTERESTED IN SO IT'S VERY
 BENIGN
 THAT MAKES US BOTH CONSUMER SAFE
 AS WELL AS THE BRANDS TRUST US
 THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
 FOR OUR BUSINESS
 OF COURSE WE HAVE TO BE CONSUMER
 FRIENDLY, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO
 THE RIGHT THING FOR BRANDS
 BOTH CONSUMERS AND BRANDS ARE
 INTERESTED IN EACH OTHERS'
 INTEREST, IF YOU WILL.
 HOW MUCH DOES ACQUIRING A BIG
 CLIENT LIKE PROCTER & GAMBLE IN
 ANY GIVEN QUARTER BUOY THE
 OVERALL BUSINESS
 BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE
 POWER THE MAJORITY OF THE S&P
 500'S PROGRAMATIC TRANSACTIONS,
 THERE'S NO ONE COMPANY THAT
 MOVES THE NEEDLE IN ANY BIG OR
 SMALL WAY.
 OF COURSE P & G IS MUCH BIGGER
 IN THEIR ADVERTISING SPEND THAN
 REALLY ANYBODY ELSE.
 BUT WHEN YOU ADD THAT TO THE
 WHOLE, IT'S A VERY BIG HEAD.
 YOU MENTIONED CONNECTED TV.
 IT'S AN AREA THAT'S GROWING VERY
 FAST
 WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF APPLE'S
 ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY AND THE
 BALANCE BETWEEN THE STREAMING
 SERVICES OF WHO HAS ADS AND WHO
 HAS JUST SUBSCRIPTIONS
 YEAH.
 SO APPLE'S ANNOUNCEMENT DOESN'T
 SURPRISE ME AT ALL
 IT'S THE BYPRODUCT OF BASICALLY
 OUR ENTIRE INDUSTRY MARCHING
 TOWARD A TRILLION DOLLARS.
 ADVERTISING WILL BE A TRILLION
 DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN LESS THAN TEN
 YEARS.
 WHETHER YOU'RE AMAZON OR APPLE,
 YOU HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT
 TRILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES AND
 GETTING IN ADS IS EASIER THAN
 DRILLING FOR OIL
 BUT THERE'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
 IN CONNECTED TV BECAUSE THE
 AVERAGE CONSUMER WAS ON NETFLIX,
 THEY WERE ON AMAZON, AND NOW THE
 SUBSCRIPTION MODELS ARE LESS
 APPEALING THAN THE AD-FUNDED
 MODELS
 SO, FOR INSTANCE, IN OUR Q2 OVER
 LAST YEAR WE SAW 21X GROWTH IN
 INVENTORY AND THAT'S JUST A
 BYPRODUCT OF MORE AND MORE
 VIEWERS GOING TO THINGS WHERE
 THERE ARE ADS INSTEAD OF PAYING
 THE EXPENSIVE PRICE OF CABLE,
 WHICH IS AD FUNDED, AND NETFLIX,
 AND A BUNCH OF OTHER
 SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT DON'T HAVE
 ADS.
 IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN
 PREDICTING THAT NETFLIX WILL GO
 TO AN AD MODEL
 I DO THINK THEY WILL GO TO AN
 AD MODEL
 THEY HAVE SO MUCH AMBITION IN
 THE REST OF THE WORLD WHERE IT'S
 TOO EXPENSIVE TO PAY $15 A
 MONTH.
 THEY ENVY THE REACH OF YOUTUBE
 IN MARKETS WHERE IT'S JUST
 REALLY EXPENSIVE TO HAVE A
 SUBSCRIPTION
 I THINK EVENTUALLY THEY'LL OFFER
 BOTH
 THE MAJORITY OF CONSUMERS WOULD
 RATHER SEE ADS AND PAY LESS.
 WE'VE BEEN SO INTERESTED IN
 THE BUSINESS WE HAVEN'T GONE ON
 TO THE DEAL TODAY.
 TELL US ABOUT THAT
 SO FAR THERE'S BEEN QUITE A LOT
 OF PROTECTIONISM IN CHINA WITH
 THE BIG TECH COMPANIES
 IT'S JUST NOT LETTING ANYONE
 ELSE IN.
 YEAH, SO WHY TO ALIBABA AND
 TENCENT HAVE MORE MARKET SHARE
 THAN THEIR EQUIVALENTS HERE?
 THE THING THAT IS INTERESTING
 ABOUT THE POSITION WE'RE IN,
 BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A MEDIA
 COMPANY, WE THINK WE'RE ONE OF
 THE FEW COMPANIES IN THE WORLD
 THAT CAN PARTNER WITH ALL OF
 THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND APPLE
 AS WELL.
 WE PARTNERED WITH THEM IN THE
 PAST
 IT'S POSSIBLE WE CAN DO THAT
 AGAIN.
 BUT THE THING THAT'S REALLY
 INTERESTING ABOUT ALIBABA AND
 T
 TENCENT, THEY HAVE HAD A GO IT
 ALONE STRATEGY
 THEY NEED TO GET MORE OF THEIR
 FAIR SHARE OF SPEND RELATIVE TO
 WHERE CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING
 MONEY THAN THEY HAVE IN THE
 PAST
 AND THAT MEANS MOSTLY GETTING
 ADVERTISING SPEND FROM COMPANIES
 THAT ARE NOT BASED IN CHINA.
 SO BECAUSE WE PARTNER WITH ALL
 THESE COMPANIES ALREADY AND
 THEY'RE LOOKING TO PUT THEIR
 DATA TO WORK, THEY NEED TO TAKE
 IT INTO CHINA WITH A PARTNER
 THAT THEY TRUST.
 IT'S MUCH HARDER FOR TENCENT TO
 SAY GIVE US YOUR DATA AND WE'LL
 HELP YOU BUY ADS THAN IT IS FOR
 US, WHO THEY ALREADY WORK WITH,
 TO SAY, HEY, WE CAN PROTECT IT
 AND HELP YOU MAKE DECISIONS
 BETWEEN TENCENT, ALIBABA OR
 ICHIE OR ANY OF THE OTHERS.
 HAS THERE BEEN A BIG SLOWDOWN
 THERE ALONG WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN
 ECONOMICALLY IN CHINA?
 I THINK MORE AND MORE IT'S
 GOING TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKETING.
 IF YOU'RE GOOD AT IT, YOU WILL
 WIN MARKET SHARE AND IF YOU'RE
 NOT, YOU'RE NOT.
 I DO THINK THERE'S SOME
 CYCLICALITY TO IT.
 BUT IF YOUR NOT ADVERTISING
 WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
 DOING WELL
 YOU HAVE TO ADVERTISE IN GOOD
 MARKETS AND IN BAD MARKETS.
 JEFF GREEN, THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 MIKE SANTOLI HAS A MYSTERY
 CHART FOR US TODAY
 WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS OR
 WHAT IT MEANS.
 DO YOU KNOW WHAT I FEAR
 THAT NEITHER OF US WILL
 FIGURE IT OUT.
 NO, I DON'T MIND ABOUT THAT
 MY FEAR IS THAT YOU WILL FIGURE
 IT OUT AND I WON'T.
 WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY LIKELY,
 OR ELSE I'LL BE VERY MAD AT MIKE
 SANTOLI.
 WE WILL
 YES, I'M GOING TO START THINKING
 NOW.
 BY THE WAY, LAST TIME THAT'S
 WHAT HAPPENED.
 NO.
 I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.
 I DO NOT ACCEPT THAT
 ANYWAY, THIS TIME IS WHAT
 MATTERS.
 THAT'S COMING AFTER THE BREAK.
 SO IS THE FACT THAT PURDUE
 PHARMA HAS DECIDED TO PAY THE
 LARGEST SETTLEMENT YESTERDAY
 THE COMPANY FACES MORE CLAIMS
 THAT IT UNDERPAID THE DRUG
 ADDICTIVES AS WE'RE BACK IN A
 COUPLE OF MINUTES.
 TIME FOR A CNBC NEWS UPDATE WITH SUE HERERA.
 HELLO, EVERYONE
 HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THIS
 HOUR
 ON CAPITOL HILL SENATOR MINORITY
 LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER BASHING
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LATEST FED
 PICK, STEPHEN MOORE, SAYING THE
 CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST DOESN'T
 HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF TO JOIN THE
 FEDERAL RESERVE'S BOARD OF
 GOVERNORS.
 MR. MOORE DOESN'T HAVE THE
 BACKGROUND, HE'S A POLITICIAN.
 HE'S POLITICAL
 HE'S ALWAYS WANTED CUT TAXES,
 CUT TAXES, CUT TAXES
 HE'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE
 SUCH A BIG DEFICIT RIGHT NOW
 BECAUSE OF HIS ADVOCACY.
 CHICAGO OFFICIALS CALLING
 THE DECISION TO DROP ALL CHARGES
 AGAINST ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT AN
 OUTRAGE.
 THE MAYOR AND CHIEF OF POLICE
 HOLDING A BRIEF NEWS CONFERENCE
 AFTER THE DECISION.
 HE DID THIS ALL IN THE NAME
 OF SELF-PROMOTION AND HE USED
 THE LAWS OF THE HATE CRIME
 LEGISLATION THAT ALL OF US
 COLLECTIVELY OVER YEARS HAVE PUT
 ON THE BOOKS TO STAND UP TO THE
 VALUES THAT EMBODY WHAT WE
 BELIEVE IN
 THIS IS A WHITEWASH OF JUSTICE
 YOU ARE UP TO DATE
 THAT'S THE NEWS UPDATE THIS
 HOUR, WILF, SARA, I'LL SEND IT
 BACK DOWNTOWN TO YOU.
 SUE, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR
 THAT.
 MIKE IS OVER AT THE
 TELESTRATOR WITH TODAY'S MYSTERY
 CHART.
 WE TEASED THE ASPECT OF IT
 YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE US A CLUE.
 I WILL GIVE YOU A CLUE.
 THIS IS THE PRICE -JUST
 DISREGARD THE M OVER HERE.
 THAT'S A STOCK PRICE OF AN ETF,
 VERY LARGE, THAT'S DONE VERY
 WELL OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS.
 IT IS NOT A SECTOR OF THE
 MARKET, BUT IT IS A STYLE OF
 INVESTING, A CATEGORY THE STOCKS
 OF A CERTAIN FLAVOR.
 QQQ.
 IT IS NOT THE QQQ.
 GROWTH?
 BOND PROXIES.
 SARA IS CORRECT
 MINIMUM VOLATILITY ETF
 STOCKS THAT HAVE -AS A
 PORTFOLIO, LOWER VOLATILITY THAN
 THE OVERALL MARKET
 IT IS SIMILAR TO THE SPOV BUT
 THIS IS A PORTFOLIO OF STOCKS
 PUT TOGETHER STRICTLY TO ACHIEVE
 LOWER VOLATILITY
 YOU SEE HOW MUCH DEMAND THIS HAS
 BEEN
 IN THEORY THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE
 AS GOOD OF RETURNS AS THE
 OVERALL MARKET OVER A LONG
 PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE
 TAKING LESS RISK
 IT'S AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH RIGHT
 HERE
 HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.
 THIS IS ANOTHER PERIOD WHERE IT
 ACCELERATED HIGHER
 THIS IS 2016
 WE ARE BACK IN THAT 2016 TYPE OF
 MARKET
 LOW INTEREST RATES, BUT BUYING
 THESE BOND PROXY STOCKS.
 THIS WAS A PRETTY IMPORTANT
 PEAK, IT WAS UP OVER THE COURSE
 OF THE PRIOR TWO YEARS 25% IN A
 FLATTISH MARKET.
 SAME THING RIGHT HERE OVER THESE
 TWO YEARS.
 SO IT RAISES THE SAME QUESTION
 ARE PEOPLE JUST HIDING IN THIS
 AREA AND IT'S GOING TO GET
 UNWOUND SOMEHOW IF WE GET BETTER
 GROWTH.
 OR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING
 THE DEATH OF THE MULTI-DECADE
 BULL MARKET IN BONDS FOREVER AND
 EVER AND EVER.
 EVERY TIME WE GET A FAKE-OUT
 LIKE LAST FALL --
 YOU DO GET EARNINGS GROWTH
 ALONG WITH IT BUT THAT'S WHAT WE
 GOT.
 I THINK I WON.
 NO, NOBODY WON.
 I THINK THE SCORE IS 2-0,
 SARA
 WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME?
 IT WAS AN UNDER ARMOUR CHART.
 MIKE JUST GAVE YOU THE WIN
 AND YOU'VE PASSED IT ON.
 NOT ONLY DID I WIN BUT I
 REMEMBERED.
 THAT'S FINE
 I'LL FIGHT BACK.
 WE'VE GOT MANY, MANY HUNDREDS OF

 PURDUE PHARMA FACING MORE
 THAN 1500 LAWSUITS LINKED TO ITS
 PAIN KILLERS
 THE COMPANY MADE A MAJOR
 SETTLEMENT WITH THE STATE OF
 OKLAHOMA TODAY
 BUT THE FAMILY THAT OWNS PURDUE
 IS FACING FALLOUT IN UNEXPECTED
 AREAS.
 AMAZON IS GETTING MORE BRICK
 AND MORTAR COMPETITION AS
 ANOTHER INTERNET RETAILER IS
 PLANNING TO OPEN A PHYSICAL
 RETAIL STORE
 WE'LL SIZE UP THE PROSPECTS FOR
 THIS PLAYER COMING UP.
      My experience with USAA
        has been excellent.
      They really appreciate      the military family
       and it really shows.
     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we would call
    another insurance company,
      hey would say      “Oh we can't beat USAA”
     We're the Webber family.
        We're the Tenney's
         We're the Hayles,
 and we're USAA members for life.

 OPIOID MAKER PURDUE PHARMA REACHING A $270 MILLION
 SETTLEMENT OVER ITS OXYCONTIN
 DRUG BUT STILL FACES HUNDREDS
 OFOF
 OTHER LAWSUITS
 ADITI ROY HAS THE STORY.
 TODAY'S SETTLEMENT COULD BE
 JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR
 PURDUE PHARMA WHICH FACES OVER A
 THOUSAND OTHER CASES
 THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY WILL
 GO TOWARDS A NATIONAL ADDICTION
 CENTER AT OKLAHOMA STATE
 UNIVERSITY.
 IT IS GOING TO SAVE COUNTLESS
 LIVES AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP
 FAMILIES TOGETHER.
 AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE TIP OF
 THE SPEAR IN TERMS OF LEADING
 THE NATION OUT OF THE ADDICTION
 EPIDEMIC THAT HAS CLAIMED JUST
 THIS PAST YEAR 70,000 LIVES.
 THE AGREEMENT ALSO MEANS TWO
 MEMBERS OF THE SACKLER FAMILY
 WHICH FOUNDED THE COMPANY WILL
 NOT HAVE TO TESTIFY IN COURT
 MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY SAID WHILE
 THE AGREEMENT ANNOUNCED TODAY IS
 NOT A FINANCIAL MODEL FOR FUTURE
 SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS, THE
 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL
 CENTER IS A UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT
 STEP THAT WE HOPE WILL SAVE
 LIVES.
 PURDUE REPORTEDLY FACES UP TO
 1600 CASES IN THE OPIOID CRISIS,
 INCLUDING 37 STATES WHICH HAVE
 SUED THE COMPANY SINCE 2017.
 THE COMPANY HAS DENIED
 WRONGDOING SAYING LABELS FOR ITS
 PAIN KILLER CARRIED WARNINGS
 ABOUT THE RISK OF ABUSE AND
 MISUSE
 EARLIER THIS MONTH THE PURDUE
 CEO SAID THE COMPANY IS LOOKING
 AT POSSIBLE BANKRUPTCY SAS A
 RESULT OF THESE CLAIMS
 TODAY'S SETTLEMENT LEAVES CLAIMS
 PENDING JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND
 ISRAEL-BASED TEVA
 PHARMACEUTICALS.
 ROBERT FRANK IS HERE WITH A
 LOOK AT THE FATE OF THE FAMILY'S
 MASSIVE FORTUNE.
 YES, THEY ARE WORTH THAN
 ESTIMATED $13 BILLION.
 THEY HAVE GIVEN HUNDREDS OF
 MILLIONS TO MUSEUMS AND
 CHARITIES AROUND THE WORLD BUT
 NOW THE FAMED SACKLER FAMILY IS
 UNDER SIEGE FOR ITS ROLE
 THE $270 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN
 OKLAHOMA TODAY INVOLVED $75
 MILLION PERSONALLY FROM THE
 SACKLER FAMILY ITSELF.
 THAT'S A SMALL PRICE GIVEN THAT
 COURT DOCUMENTS SHOW THEY EARNED
 $4 BILLION FROM PURDUE PHARMA
 BETWEEN 2008 AND 2016, BUT THE
 COSTS COULD ESCALATE
 AS ADITI MENTIONED, THERE ARE
 1600 OTHER LAWSUITS WAITING FOR
 TRIAL.
 FOR YEARS THE FAMILY HAS ARGUED
 THAT THEY WERE MERELY PASSIVE
 INVESTORS IN PURDUE.
 BUT THE DOCUMENTS IN THE
 MASSACHUSETTS CASE FILED
 REVEALED THE FAMILY WAS ACTIVELY
 INVOLVED IN DECISIONS RELATING
 TO OXYCONTIN
 MUSEUMS AND CHARITY GROUPS
 REFUSING FURTHER GIFTS FROM THE
 FAMILY, EVEN LOOKING AT POSSIBLY
 RETURNING FUNDS.
 THE TATE MUSEUMS IN LONDON AND
 GUGGENHEIM IN NEW YORK SAID THEY
 WOULD NOT ACCEPT FURTHERGIFTS
 FROM THE FAMILY.
 THE LOUVRE AND METROPOLITAN
 MUSEUM OF SCIENCE HAVE ALSO
 RECEIVED DONATIONS BUT THEIR
 FORTUNE WILL LIKELY REMAIN
 INTACT BECAUSE THEIR NET WORTH
 IS SPREAD OUT OVER A MUCH LARGER
 GROUP OF COMPANIES
 THEY HAVE OTHER CORPORATE
 INVESTMENTS AND THERE IS STILL A
 PERCEPTION THAT EVEN IF THEY
 FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY FOR THE
 COMPANY, THAT WILL CREATE A
 FIREWALL BETWEEN THESE SUITS AND
 THEIR PERSONAL FORTUNE.
 BUT THIS $75 MILLION THEY
 HAVE GIVEN SO FAR WAS OF THEIR
 OWN WILL, IT WASN'T PART OF THE
 SETTLEMENT ITSELF.
 THEY DECIDED TO GIVE THAT, THE
 FAMILY
 WELL, IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER
 THAT WAS A VOLUNTARY DECISION,
 BUT IT NOW SETS PRECEDENT THAT
 THEY ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE
 SETTLEMENTS.
 THEY PAID AS PART OF THE
 SETTLEMENT AND THAT COULD SET
 PRECEDENT FOR THE OTHER CASES.
 THAT'S SORT OF AN ADMISSION THAT
 THEY WERE IN SOME WAY INVOLVED
 IN THIS.
 IT'S INTERESTING, I WAS GOING
 TO SAY THESE MUSEUMS REFUSING
 THESE DONATIONS.
 IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH, A LOT
 OF THESE FORTUNES WERE BUILT ON,
 WHO KNOWS, QUESTIONABLE
 ACTIVITIES.
 SURE.
 AND THERE WERE MANY CHURCHES
 THAT REFUSED TO ACCEPT JOHN D.
 ROCKEFELLER'S MONEY BECAUSE THEY
 SAID HE WAS ENGAGING IN
 MONOPOLISTIC BEHAVIOR.
 BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
 WE'VE SEEN ANYBODY -AMIDST ALL
 THESE CRISIS AND SCANDAL OF ANY
 INSTITUTION SAYING WE'RE NOT
 GOING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, THIS
 IS THE FIRST WE'VE SEEN IN
 DECADES.
 I WAS LOOKING AT THE
 SMITHSONIAN WHO HAS A SACKLER
 GALLERY.
 THEY ARE CONTRACTUALLY BOUND TO
 KEEP THAT NAME.
 AND THE SACKLER FAMILY TRUST
 SAYING TODAY THEY ARE PUTTING A
 TEMPORARY PAUSE ON ANY GIFTS TO
 ANYONE UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED.
 ROBERT, THANKS VERY MUCH.
 WEWORK IS WORKING HARD IN
 THE SHARING ECONOMY BUT DESPITE
 RAPID EXPANSION AND INCREASE IN
 REVENUES, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY
 HAVE TO WORK HARDER TO BECOME
 PROFITABLE AS AN IPO
 THAT STORY IS AHEAD.
 BUT FIRST, PODCASTS ARE ON
 OUR RADAR AS SPOTIFY CONTINUES
 TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN THAT SCEPA
 WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE
 STREAMING GIANT IS UP TO NOW,
 NEXT
     erything.
        No not everything,
  I mean you're still blatantly      sucking up to me Gary.
    Brilliantly observed, sir.
    Always three steps ahead.
    Six steps ahead. Sixteen.
          So many steps.
            You done?
      A million steps ahead.
    <i> ServiceNow. Works for you.</i>
 See that's funny, I thought you traded options.
 I'm not really a Wall Street guy.
 What's the hesitation?
 Eh, it just feels too complicated, you know?
 Well sure, at first, but JJ can help you with that.
 JJ, will you break it down for this gentleman?
 Hey, Ian. You know, at TD Ameritrade, we can walk you
 through your options trades step by step
 until you're comfortable.
 I could be up for that.
 That's taking options trading from Wall St. to Main St.
 Hey guys, wanna play some pool?

 WELCOME BACK HERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER
 STORIES ON THE "CLOSING BELL"
 TODAY.
 I WENT WITH McDONALD'S
 ACQUISITION OF DYNAMIC YIELD
 IT'S PART OF THEIR PLAN TO
 INCORPORATE MORE TECHNOLOGY IN
 THEIR LOCATIONS.
 THEY WILL ASSIST IN UPDATING THE
 DIGITAL DRIVE-THROUGH MENUS TO
 CHANGE DEPENDING ON DIFFERENT
 FACTORS, LIKE THE WEATHER.
 THE COMPANY'S LARGEST
 ACQUISITION IN 20 YEARS,
 REPORTEDLY VALUED AT MORE THAN
 $300 MILLION
 I ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING HOW
 FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS ARE
 GETTING MORE AND MORE INTO
 TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER USING MORE
 ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATING THEIR
 MENUS.
 IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY OBVIOUS
 THING TO GIVE YOU CHOICES BASED
 ON PREFERENCES OR WEATHER.
 AND TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GET MORE
 VOLUME THROUGH EACH DOOR.
 ELECTRONIC ORDERING IS NOT
 THAT EFFICIENT I FIND.
 YOU HAVE TO GO TO ALL THE
 MENUS.
 IT GOES IN, TAKES A BIT OF
 TIME AND IT'S NOT THAT
 INSTANTANEOUS WHEN YOU GO TO
 COLLECT IT
 USUALLY A MORNING COFFEE WHEN I
 GO TO McDONALD'S.
 NOT A McMUFFIN?
 NO HASH BROWNS, REALLY
 WAYFAIR IS GOING FROM ONLINE
 TO OFFLINE
 THEY PLAN TO OPEN THEIR FIRST
 FULL-SERVICE STORE IN
 MASSACHUSETTS LATER THIS YEAR.
 SHOPPERS CAN PURCHASE PRODUCTS
 IN STORE TO TAKE HOME OR PLACE
 ORDERS FOR HOME DELIVERY
 WAYFAIR PLANS TO OPEN FOUR
 POP-UP LOCATIONS THIS SUMMER
 THIS MAKES MORE SENSE BECAUSE
 YOU CAN REALLY GO AND VIEW AND
 EXPERIENCE THE FURNITURE
 YOU PROBABLY WON'T TAKE IT HOME
 UNDER YOUR ARM DEPENDING ON WHAT
 THE ITEM IS.
 BUT OF ALL THOSE ONLINE STORES,
 IT SEEMS MORE --
 WE'VE HAD THE WAYFAIR CEO ON
 SO MANY TIMES.
 WE ASK HIM WHY ARE PEOPLE GOING
 TO BUY FURNITURE ONLINE WITHOUT
 TRYING IT OUT IN STORE
 HE SAID BECAUSE THE PRICES ARE
 BETTER AND WE PUT SUCH A GOOD
 JOB PUTTING IT OUT.
 AND THEY HAVE A REPUTATION
 FOR BEING DECENT PRODUCTS SO
 PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE LEAP.
 IT'S GOOD QUALITY.
 EVEN IF YOU GO TO A TRA
 TRADITIONAL FURNITURE STORE,
 YOU'RE JUST SEEING A FLOOR
 MODEL.
 I DO THINK IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR
 THOSE WHO SAY RETAIL IS NOT
 DYING.
 THE E-COMMERCE FOLKS HAVE TO GET
 INTO RETAIL AS WELL.
 IF IT'S MORE EFFICIENT TO DO
 IT THAT WAY, THEY'LL TRY IT.
 SPOTIFY ANNOUNCING PLANS TO
 BUY A PODCAST COMPANY, PAR CAST.
 IT'S THE STREAMING GIANT'S 30
 ACQUISITION OF A PODCAST COMPANY
 WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS
 TERMS OF THE DEAL WERE NOT
 DISCLOSED BUT SPOTIFY EXPECTS TO
 SPEND $500 MILLION ON TOTAL
 ACQUISITIONS THIS YEAR
 SPOTIFY AT SOME POINT WAS
 TALKING ABOUT ORIGINAL
 PROGRAMMING.
 THEY'LL GET KNEESTHESE EXCLUSIV
 IT SEEMS LIKE PODCASTS IS AN
 AREA YOU COULD DO THAT
 ALSO I IMAGINE SOMEBODY'S
 PODCAST LISTENING HABITS ARE
 GOING TO TELL YOU A GOOD DEAL
 ABOUT THEIR INTERESTS AND,
 THEREFORE, AD TARGETING AND
 THINGS LIKE THAT.
 AND PODCASTS IN GENERAL GOING
 FORWARD ARE PROBABLY CHEAPER FOR
 THEM NOT TO ACQUIRE THE
 COMPANIES PER SE, BUT BUYING THE
 RIGHTS TO THE SONGS, WHICH WE
 KNOW IS GREAT FOR THEM.
 ALSO ANOTHER PIECE OF
 EVIDENCE THAT CONTENT IS KING
 RIGHT NOW.
 LOOK AT APPLE YESTERDAY.
 LOOK AT HOW MANY SCRIPTED SHOWS
 ARE IN THE WORKS AND HOW TOP
 DOLLAR THAT THEY'RE GETTING.
 AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GO
 WHERE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THEIR
 DIGITAL TIME
 IF YOU LISTEN TO A 40-MINUTE
 PODCAST, THAT'S TEN SONGS THAT
 YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ON SPOTIFY
 DURING THAT PERIOD.
 WE HAVE SOME NEWS ON BOEING.
 PHIL LeBEAU IS JOINING US ON THE
 PHONE WITH MORE ON THAT.
 HI, PHIL.
 HEY, WILF, ANY TIME YOU HAVE
 SOMETHING GOING ON RIGHT NOW
 WITH THE BOEING 737 MAX IT'S
 GOING TO GET A LOT OF ATTENTION
 AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS
 AFTERNOON.
 WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, THERE WAS
 AN EMERGENCY LANDING OF A
 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES BOEING 737
 MAX PLANE IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA.
 THIS WAS A PLANE THAT WAS IN
 ORLANDO AND IT WAS ON A FLIGHT
 TO BE STORED IN VICTORVILLE,
 CALIFORNIA, THAT'S WHERE
 SOUTHWEST IS PARKING THESE
 PLANES WHILE THEY ARE OFFICIALLY
 GROUNDED BY THE FAA.
 THERE WAS AN ENGINE ISSUE
 SHORTLY AFTER THEY TOOK OFF, SO
 THEY RADIOED THE TOWER
 THEY CAME AROUND, DID AN
 EMERGENCY LANDING.
 RELATIVE TO WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF
 WHEN THEY THINK OF EMERGENCY
 LANDING, THIS WAS NOT A HUGE
 DEAL
 I TALKED WITH SOME PEOPLE AT THE
 FAA AND THEY SAID LOOK,
 RELATIVELY SPEAKING, THIS WAS
 A -THEY CAME AROUND, SAW AN
 ISSUE, THEY LANDED
 MORE IMPORTANTLY AND SOMETHING
 PEOPLE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND AS
 THEY LOOK AT SHARES OF BOEING,
 IT WAS UNRELATED TO THE REASONS
 WHY THE 737 MAX IS CURRENTLY
 GROUNDED BY THE FAA.
 AGAIN, THIS WAS AN ENGINE ISSUE
 ON A FERRY FLIGHT THAT HAD
 NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUES
 THAT CAUSED THE GROUNDING OF THE
 737 MAX BY THE FAA
 NO PASSENGERS ONBOARD, PHIL
 NO PASSENGERS ONBOARD
 FOUR PEOPLE, FLIGHT CREW
 THEY'RE MOVING IT OUT THERE
 WHERE THEY'RE PARKING ALL OF
 THEIR 737 MAXES WHILE THEY'RE
 GROUNDED.
 OKAY, FILL, THANKS VERY MUCH
 FOR THAT
 THE STOCK DOWN 1% AS WE SPEAK.
 WEWORKS' RAPID EXPANSION
 LAST YEAR CAME WITH A HEFTY
 PRICE.
 WHY THE COMPANY'S LOSSES DOUBLED
 TO NEAR LOW $2 BILLION
 THAT'S UP NEXT
 THE SENATE HOLDING A PROCEDURAL VOTE ON THE GREEN NEW
 DEAL.
 Reporter: WELL, THE
 RESOLUTION ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL
 DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO
 PASS THE SENATE.
 CURRENTLY THE VOTE STANDS AT 57
 VOTING NO AND NONE VOTING YES.
 DEMOCRATS WERE LARGELY EXPECTED
 TO VOTE PRESENT TO AVOID HAVING
 TO GO ON THE RECORD EITHER FOR
 OR AGAINST THIS CONTROVERSIAL
 PROPOSAL, BUT THERE WERE A FEW
 NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS
 SENATORS KRISTEN CINEMA, DOUG
 JONES AND JOE MANCHIN, THREE
 DEMOCRATS THAT VOTED NO.
 ALSO INDEPENDENT SENATOR ANGUS
 KING ALSO A NO
 DEM BEEN CALLING THIS A SHAM
 VOTE
 EVEN REPRESENTATIVE ALEXANDRIA
 OCASIO-CORTEZ WHO ORIGINALLY
 SPONSORED THIS IDEA SAID THAT
 THIS IS JUST REPUBLICANS PLAYING
 POLITICS
 OF COURSE REPUBLICANS SAY THAT
 DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE WILLING TO
 TAKE A STAND ON A PROPOSAL THAT
 THEY AT LEAST PAID LIP SERVICE
 TO
 AS OF NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE THE
 RESOLUTION ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL
 HAS NOW OFFICIALLY FAILED TO
 ADVANCE IN THE SENATE.
 BACK OVER TO YOU
 SO DOES THAT MEAN, YLAN, THAT
 IT'S DONE OR ARE WE GOING TO
 CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT THIS AND
 IS IT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A
 CAMPAIGN TOPIC
 Reporter: YOU'LL TEN TO HEAR
 ABOUT IT EVEN THOUGH THIS VOTE
 IN THE SENATE IS OVER AND THIS
 IS NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.
 BUT CERTAINLY THIS IS STILL
 SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO PLAY
 A LARGE ROLE IN THE 2020
 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
 AS YOU HEARD SOME REPORTS THAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TODAY HE
 HOPES THAT THE GREEN NEW DEAL
 STAYS ALIVE SO THAT HE CAN
 CAMPAIGN AGAINST IT.
 OKAY, YLAN, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH FOR THAT.
 TE> UP NEXT, WHAT WEWORKS'
 LAST REVENUE AND LOSS NUMBERS
 COULD MEAN FOR ITS IPO
 WE'LL BE BACK IN A COUPLE OF
 MINUTES.

 WORK SPACE SETUP WEWORK, WHILE REVENUE JUMPED LAST YEAR,
 IT WASN'T ALL GOOD NEWS.
 DEIDRE BOSA HAS THE BREAKDOWN
 ISN'T SAN FRANCISCO.
 HEY, WILF, THAT'S EXACTLY
 RIGHT.
 REVENUE MAY HAVE DOUBLED TO $1.8
 BILLION SO SO DID ITS LOSSES
 THEY WERE EVEN HIGHER AT $2
 BILLION.
 WHILE THAT IS A HUGE NUMBER,
 IT'S NOT ACTUALLY VERY UNUSUAL
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER BIG
 STARTUPS GETTING READY TO TAP
 PUBLIC MARKETS
 BURNING THROUGH CASH IN FAVOR OF
 GROWTH IS PAR FOR THE COURSE
 THESE DAYS
 LYFT'S LOSSES WERE NORTH OF $900
 MILLION LAST YEAR.
 UBER'S LOSS, $1.8 BILLION.
 PINTEREST'S LOSSES WERE ONLY IN
 THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
 ZOOM'S S-1 WAS REMARKABLE
 BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS ACTUALLY
 PROFITABLE
 WEWORKS' VICE CHAIRMAN, MICHAEL
 GROSS, TELLING ME THERE ARE A
 NUMBER OF LEVERS THAT COULD BE
 LESS UNPROFITABLE BUT DOING SO
 WOULD COME AT THE EXPENSE OF
 GROWTH AND THEY DON'T WANT TO DO
 THAT
 THEY'RE WATCHING THE UPCOMING
 GRAUP OF IPOs CLOSELY AND THE
 NEXT WEEK WILL BE CRITICAL AND
 THE LIFTS AHEAD.
 LYFT IS EXPECTED TO DEBUT THIS
 FRIDAY, UBER AS EARLY AS APRIL
 PRIVATE MARKETS THAT ARE FLUSH
 WITH CAPITAL HAVE LED THESE
 COMPANIES' VALUATIONS HIGHER AND
 HIGHER
 WE'LL SEE IF PUBLIC MARKET
 INVESTORS VALUE GROWTH OVER
 PROFITS AS WELL OR IF THESE
 RIDE-SHARING COMPANIES AND
 OTHERS END UP MORE LIKE SNAP AND
 GROUPON, OTHER TECH DARLINGS
 THAT WENT PUBLIC WITH NO PROFITS
 AND HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE
 AFTERMATH.
 GUYS.
 DEED REMARKS I GUESS LYFT IS
 AN EXAMPLE WHERE DESPITE A
 WIDENING LOSS, THE MARKET STILL
 HAPPY TO GET ONBOARD AND THE
 INDICATIONS ARE THAT'S EVEN
 GOING TO GO ABOVE THE EARLIER
 INDICATED RANGE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 WE DID HAVE A SOURCE TELL US
 THAT IT'S GOING TO BE PRICING
 ABOVE ITS EXPECTED RANGE
 REMEMBER, THAT ITS LESS PRIVATE
 MARKET VALUATION WAS $16
 BILLION.
 IT'S ALREADY RAISED BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS.
 IT IS EXPECTED TO GO PUBLIC
 LATER THIS WEEK AT A VALUATION
 NORTH OF $23 BILLION
 THAT'S A HUGE JUMP
 UBER, THE JUMP IS EXPECTED TO BE
 EVEN HIGHER.
 WE KNOW IN THE LEAD-UP TO ITS
 IPO, UBER IS SHORING UP
 BUSINESSES AND POTENTIALLY EVEN
 TAKING MORE INVESTMENT.
 DEIDRE, STAY WITH US.
 MIKE AS A CONVERSATION ON THE
 IPO PIPELINE AND THE FACT THAT
 MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE
 VERY QUICKLY GROWING REVENUES
 AND ALSO GIANT LOSSES.
 YEAH, WE'VE SEEN VERY HOT IPO
 MARKETS BEFORE, BUT MOSTLY IT
 WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF SMALLER
 DEALS OF COMPANIES IN THE EARLY
 STAGES
 PRETTY MUCH UNPRECEDENTED TO
 HAVE ALL OF THESE MULTI BILLION
 DOLLAR PRIVATE MARKET VALUATIONS
 KIND OF HEADING FOR THE PUBLIC
 MARKET EXIT AT ONCE.
 DEIDRE IS RIGHT, IN TERMS OF
 TESTING THE PUBLIC MARKET'S
 TOLERANCE FOR TRUSTING THAT
 THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO GET
 TO A CERTAIN SCALE OR FIND THE
 WAY TO THEIR NEXT ACT THAT'S
 GOING TO BE PROFITABLE, TO BE
 HONEST, THESE ARE NOT COMPANIES
 IF YOU TALK ABOUT LYFT, WEWORK,
 UBER, DOOR DASH, AND OTHER
 DELIVERY COMPANIES ARE PAYING
 PEOPLE TO DRIVE THINGS AROUND.
 THESE ARE OLD BUSINESSES TRYING
 IT IN A NEW WAY.
 THAT'S WHY I WONDER IF THE
 PUBLIC WILL GIVE A BIG PREMIUM
 TO THE PRIVATE MARKET
 VALUATIONS.
 DEIDRE, JUST QUICKLY, THE
 OTHER FACTOR WE WONDERED, WOULD
 THERE BE A PUSHBACK ON THE
 STRUCTURES OR EVEN A CONCERN
 WHEN THE S-1s SAY WE MAY NEVER,
 EVER BE PROFITABLE AN IT SEEMS
 PEOPLE DON'T MIND.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 YOU HAD PINTEREST SAY IT WAS
 GOING TO DO A DUAL STRUCTURE
 LYFT'S FOUNDERS ARE EXPECTED TO
 REMAIN ALMOST MAJORITY CONTROL
 SOME ARGUE IF YOU DON'T WANT THE
 DUAL STRUCTURE DON'T GO WITH A
 LYFT, GO WITH AN UBER THAT WILL
 HAVE A ONE VOTE STRUCTURE.
 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
 HOW THEY PERFORM INSPECT TERMS
 OF WHO HAS THAT STRUCTURE AND
 WHO DOESN'T BECAUSE THIS HAS
 IMPORTANT INDICATIONS. OF ATTORE
 FAMILIAR WITH, DO THE PAPERWOR E
 FAMILIAR WITH, DO THE PAPERWOR
 UNLOCK, YOU KNOW, THE
 SUBSCRIPTIONS OF THE WORLD FOR
 THEIR PRODUCTS SO I DO THINK IT
 MAKES SENSE AND THE WORLIS BIG
 ENOUGH FOR MULTIPLE OF THESE
 THINGS AND AS I WAS SAYING
 BEFORE, IT'S NOTOR BREAK
 FOR APPLE.
 THEY CAN PLAY THE LONG GAME, BE
 IN THE MARKETS AND SEE HOW IT
 DEVELOPS WITEIR CUSTOMER
 RELATIONSHIPS.
 ANOTHER ONE TO WATCH, AFTER
 ALL THE DRAMA AND BACK AND
 FORTH, NIKE CLOSEDHE DAY
 HIGHER AFTER THAT SHARP DROP ON
 THE AVENATTI TWEET
 BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN INTO
 CUSTODY.
 WHAT A WEIRD STORY.

 SCOTT, BACK TO YOU
 > THANKS SO MUCH
 APPLE SHARES CLOSING DOWN MORE
 THAN 1%.
 STILL UP AROUND 20% THIS YEAR,
 SO WILL THE COMPANY'S
 TRSFORMATION TO SERVICES PAY
 OFF FOR INVESTORS?
 THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION.
 THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
 IT IS
 THE STOCK IS UP 33% FROM JANUARY
 2nd WHEN THE COMPANY
 PREANNOUNCED PRETTY
 DISAPPOINTING SCAL QUARTER
 A LOT HAD TO DO WITH HARDWARE
 AND WEAKNESS IN CHINA.
 IF YOU CAN OVERLOOK ALL THAT AND
 LOOK AT THE ANNOUNCEMENTS THEY
 MADE TODAY WHILE THERE WASN'T A
 WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF DETAIL,
 PRICG, THAT SORT OF THING,
 WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO
 BE RELEASED CAN YOU THINK ABOUT
 THAT INSTALL BASE AND THE FACT
 THAT THE AVERAGE iPHONE USER
 SPENDS $44 ON -YOU KNOW,
 ANNUALLY ON THEIR -THROUGH
 THEIR DEVICE IN THIS ECOSYSTEM
 AND THAT'S A WHOLE HOST OF
 SERVICES THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO
 EXPAND THAT ECOSYSTEM.
 IT'S NOT A REASON TO BUY AT 188
 BUCKS UP 33% FROM THOSE 52-WEEK
 LOWS BUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD
 GIVE YOU SOLACE ABOUT THE FUTURE
 OF THE COMPANY AS THEY TRY TO
 FIGURE OUT HOW TO OFFSET UNIT
 DECLINES AND WHAT WILL
 ULTIMATELY DECLINING MARGINS IN
 THE HARDWARE BUSINESS.
 TIMMY, DAN SAID IT.
 NOT ENOUGH TO BUY THE STOCK.
 IS THAT RIGHT?
 AT 14 1/2 X TIMES CASH PUTS
 YOU AROUND 220, 225.
 I OWN THE STOCK.
 I THINK IT'S WORTH OWNING
 INDEPENDENT OF TODAY'S
 ANNOUNCEMENT
 I THINK I AGREE WITH DAN.
 DO YOU BUY  FRE HERE?
 YEAH, I CAN PUT FRESH CAPITAL
 WORK HERE.
 NOTHING BLUE YOU OUT OF THE
 WATER.
 THE SELL-OFF IS ABSURD
 IF THAT'S WHY IT SOLD OFF, IT
 FAILED AT 200.
 MOVING DOWN INTO THE EVENT
 ANYWAY.
 THAT'S THE --
 I MEAN TODAY, I MEAN.
 THE GO TO ACTION.
 YOU SELL IT BASICALLY ON THE
 EVENT AND CHECK THE BOX AND DID
 ENOUGH TO MAKE IT INTERESTING.
 BUT IT'S NOT KILLING NETFLIX
 PRICE ACTION SHOWS THAT.
 IT'S HELPING ROKU.
 PRICE ACTION SHOWS THAT.
 I THINK THEY DID ENOUGH WITH
 LEAVING --
  SORRY
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
 PRICE ACTION IN ROKU.
 BENEFITS THEM, TAILWIND.
 PRICE ACTION IN NETFLIX, NOT A
 NETFLIX KILLER BUT APPLE IS NOT
 A --
 IT WILL BE INCLUDED SO APPLE
 WILL BE INCLUDED ON ROKU'S
 PLATFORM.
 GUY, ATO YOU THINK,
 CREDIT CARD, THE TV, THE CREDIT
 CARD --
 WELCOME
 IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
 YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOMING
 WELCOME BACK.
 LET'S GET THOSE PLEASANTRIES OUT
 OF THE WAY.
 IT'S NICE.
 LISTEN --
 BACK TO THE MATTER AT HAND.
 IT WAS A PRETTY INTERESTING
 ANNOUNCEME GTING AWAY FROM
 THE HARDWARE SIDE AND THINK IT'S
 INTERESTING.
 CREDIT CARD, PEOPLE WILL SAY,
 NOA BIG DEAL
 FOR A LOT OF MILLENNIALS IT
 MIGHT BE
 THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT INSTALL
 BASE WITHOUT QUESTION.
 IN TERMS OF THE STOCK, THOUGH,
 ALL-TIME HIGH 232 OR SO IN
 SEPTEMBER.
 TRADED DOWN TO 1 -WHAT WAS IT
 142-ISH ON DECEMBER 24th
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE 50%
 RETRACEMENT PUTS YOU EXACTLY
 WHERE IT'S TRADING RIGHT NOW
 I HAPPEN TO WATCH THE "SQUAWK
 BOX" WITH JOE KERNEN
 HE INTERVIEWED JIM CRAMER.
 NOT THAT I'M TRYING TO CURRY
 FAVOR WITH JIM, JIM WAS DISMAYED
 IT WAS HIGHER IN THE PREMARKET
 SAYING IT WAS PERFECT TO SEL
 OFF.
 HE WAS RIGHT
 I THINK IT BACKS OFFER
 NOT TO SPAS ASPERSIONS AT APPLE.
 I JUSTY IT'S RUN TOO FAR TO
 I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN
 INTERESTING THING.
 SERVICE GROWTH IN THE QUARTER
 WAS IN THE TEENS, YOU KNOW, IT'S
 DECELERATED OFF OF WHAT WAS A
 VERY SMALL BASE.
 HIGHER GROWTH RATES AND 50% --
 NOW THAT IT'S BECOME A $20
 LLION ANNUAL BUSINESS AND
 GROWING, IT'S MUCH LESS SO TO ME
 I THINK THAT POINTING TO
 SERVICES GROWTH IS NOT THE WHOLE
 THING, YOU HAVE TO POINT TO THE
 HIGHER MARGINS BUT YOU HAD A
 GREAT DISCUSSION, THE HALFTIME
 REPORT ON AT NOON EVERY DAY.
 PROFESSIONAL.
 BUT TONY SAID HE EXPECTS
 UNITS TO BE DOWN 15% YEAR OVER
 YEAR
 THIS IS THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE
 YEAR
 THAT'S REALLY --
 YOU'LL NEED GREATER GROWTH
 AND REALLY FAT MARGINS
 THEY'RE SPLITTING --
 IS IT ENOUGH?
 IT AT LEAST GIVES YOU THE
 CONVERSATION --
 IT AT LEAST GIVES YOU THE
 CONVERSATION AND GETS YOUR MIND
 OFF THE HARDWARE BUSINESS THAT
 IS SLUGGISH AND SLOWING AND
 THINK ABOUT THE $40 BILLION
 NUMBER
 THEY SPENT TWO HOURS SPEAKING
 TO THE ENTIRE WORLD ABOUT THIS
 HUGE NEW OPPORTUNITY
 WOULDN'T YOU LE WALL STREET
 ANALYSTS TO COME OUT AND SAY
 THIS IS GOING TO BE AN X AMOUNT
 OF OPPORTUNITY
 YEAH.
 WE'LL --
 THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.
 IF YOU THINK OF FIRST OF ALL
 THE CREDIT CARD BUSINE, I
 ACTUALLY THINK THAT IS SOMETHING
 THAT ULTIMATELY COULD MOVE THE
 NEEDLE
 THE SERVICES BUSINESS, SORRY,
 THE APPLE PLUS, THE TV PLUS AND
 WHATEVER IS IN THAT BUNDLE AND
 REALIZE THEY HAVE A FEW
 HIGH-PROFILE CONTENT CREATOR ON
 THEIR PLATFORM RIGHT NOW, LOOK,
 IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.
 THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD
 HAVE TOLD THAWS WOULD HAVE
 ANGED THE STORY.
 THIS IS ABOUT A COMPANY
 ALLOCATING RESOURCES TOWARD HIGH
 MARGIN BUSINESSES AND AT THIS
 POINT AND VALUATION WHY
 SHOULDN'T WE BELIEVE APP
 "JOURNAL" THEY'VE DELIVERED ON
 EVERYTHING THEY WENT TO DO WITH
 AN INCREDIBLY LOYAL CUSTOMER
 BASE WHO -THOSE GUYS PROBABLY
 WANT --
  FOR YEARS APPLE TV WAS
 RELEASED EIGHT YEARS AGO OR
 SOMETHING AND STEVE JOBS CALLED
 IT A HOBBY
 IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CATEGORIZED
 THAT WAY
 ROKU HAD A BIG DAY
 EVERYTHING HAD A BIG DAY --
 IT'S A VERY CONFUSING.
 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE, DOES IT
 THIS IS THE FIRST OFFERING
 THIS COMPANY HAS EVER PUT OUT IN
 E SOFTWARE UNIVERSE AT YOU
 CAN GET WITHOUT THEIR HARDWARE
 THERE'S SOME THINGS ON ANDROID
 NOW.
 ES ON THE ANDROID DEVICE
 THAT IS A MASSIVE SHIFT FOR THE
 COMPANY OVER THE 40-YEAR --
 THEY HAVE TO.
 I KNOW SO THE QUESTION IS,
 THERE'S SO LITTLE DETAIL BIT
 WHO KNOWS.
 THIS MAY NOT B-THE VIDEO
 STREAMING BUSINESS MAY NOT --
 IT WASN'T ENOUGH -I'LL
 SPEAK -IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ME
 TO SAY I'M ON BOARD.
 FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T KNOW
 PRICING OR WHAT THE OFFERING
 WILL BE.
 I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH
 THERE BUT I DO OWN THE STOCK
 I OWN IT FROM LOWER AND IF I OWN
 TODAY. IS, IN EFFECT, BUYING IT
 PUTTING NEW MONEY TO WORK
 BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL STAYING
 LONG SO I THINK THEY DID ENOUGH
 TO PREOCCUPYPLE UNTIL WE GET
 ALL THE DETAILS.
 DOES IT GET YOU EXCITED ABOUT
 WHAT THEY'RE DOING FROM THE
 SERVICES STANDPOINT TO, AGAIN,
 GROW THAT BUSINESS TO ENOUGH
 SCALE TO OFFSET ANY SLOWDOWN IN
 PHONES
 LOOK.
 AND HARDWARE.
 DAN TALKED ABOUT HOW IT'S A
 SMALL BASE SO THE EARLY GROWTH
 NUMBERS OF THE DELTA WAS MORE
 IMPRESSIVE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
 BUT IT'S STILL AN ABSOLUTE IN
 TERMS OF AGGREGATE TERMS
 MASSIVE.
 I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE LOYALTY
 AND ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE WAYS
 THEY'RE MONETIZING
 PEOPLE ARE COMMITTED TO APPLE
 AND THEY'RE STUCK IF THEY'RE ON
 TV AND I CAN PICK UP A KNICKS
 GAME, $2.99 WON'T MEAN A LOT
 A LOT BEHAVE THAT WAY WITH
 APPLE.
 THEY'RE NOT SAYING IT,
 THEY'RE FOCUSING ON SERVICES AND
 IT'S BECAUSE THEY SEE THE
 DECELERATION IN HARDWARE
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAY THAT
 BUT THEIR LASER FOCUS --
 THEIR ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER
 THAN WORDS.
 JINKS.
 THE QUESTION, IS THE
 SERVICE'S BUSINESS, ARE REVENUES
 SLOWING TO THE POINT WHERE TIGHT
 GO
  -IT'S GOING TO BE A
 HINDRANCE?
 YOU CAN'T HAVE SERVICE REVENUE
 SLOWING AT THE SAME TIME THAT
 HANDSET SALES ARE SLOWING?
 IN ORDER TO GET THE VALUATION
 THEY WANT THE PEOPLE ALONG THE
 STOCK WATCH SERVICES REVENUE HAS
 TO BE AROUND 20% TO 22%.
 WHAT, ARE WE ABOUT 15%, 16%?
 AND THAT IS GETTING SLOWER
 TOWARDS THE UPSIDE
 ONE POINT, IT'S REALLY
 IMPORTANT.
 YOU DON'T TEED TO HAVE HYPER
 GROWTH
 CAN YOU HAVE MIDTEENS GROWTH ON
 A BUSINESS THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
 THAT HAS MUCH HIGHER MARGINS
 THAN THE HARDWARE BUSINESS
 GREAT FOR THE OVERALL PIE.
 THIS DOESN'T NEED TO BE A HYPER
 GROWTH STORY BUT TAKING SOME OF
 THE TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET
 THAT EXISTS AND GROWING IT ON
 YOUR USER BASE THAT MAY NOT BE
 USINOF SERVICES OF OTHER
 PROVIDERS.
 THE NEGATIVE WAY TO SPIN IT
 FROM A PERSON LONG HOW MUCH ISTL
 ABOUT TRYING TO STEM OR STOP THE
 SLIDE IN HARDWARE SALES?
 THEY'RE PUTTING AN AWFUL LOT OF
 TIME INTO SERVICES
 MAYBE THEY JUST CAN'T HANDLE THE
 SLIDE -THERE'S NOTHING TO DO
 ABOUT THE HARDWARE SIDE WHICH
 THEN BECOMES AN OVERWHELMING --
 YOU HAVE TO TARGET YOUR
 INSTALLED BASE, 1.BILLION
 DEVICES IN THE UNIVERSE OUT
 THERE.
 I KNOW.
 I'M THE INSTALL BASE TOO AND I
 WASN'T OVERWHELMED BY THIS
 THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE
 SOMETHING THAT -AT LEAST ALT
 THIS POINT.
 TIM WILL PLAY 3 BUCKS FOR A
 KNICK GAME
 THEY'RE WORTH A BUCK.
 I WILL PAY 3 BUT THAT'S WHAT
 PEOPLE DO ON THEIR iPHONES AND
 THEY HAVE A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE
 1.4 INSTALLED BASE
 THE ULTIMATE IS PROBABLY 20
 TIMES AS OPPOSED TO ABOUT 11
 TIMES ON THE HARDWARE AND
 SOMETHING PEOPLE FORGET ON A $4
 BILLION -IF.
 YOU MENTIONED JAMIE DIMON
 DIDN' -
 CRAMER DIDN'T LIKE THE STOCK UP.
 IT HAS RUN --
 THIS STOCK USUALLY RUN HAS AN
 EVENT AN SELLS OFFER
 S
 SAKINOCCI SAID ON THE SHOW --
 THE MARKETPLACE TOLD YOU THE
 VALUATION AND WEREN'T IMPRESSED
 AND SOLD THE STOCK OFF AND ALL
 RE RIVERALS WERE BOUGHT.
 UP 10% IN A MONTH.
 IT LAGGED THE MARKET TOO,
 SCOTT.
 THERE'S SOME PART THATENMENT
 GOT SO PR AND PEOPLE WERE
 LOOKING AT VALUATIONS AND APPLE
 UNDERPERFORMED
 MORE, CUPERTINO, GENE, YOU
 WERE IN THE EVENT, I BELIEVE,
 TODAY.
 WHAT'S YOUR TAKEAWAY TONIGHT
 SCOTT, REALLY TWO IMPACT.
 IF YOU PUT THESE FOUR SERVICES
 TOGETHER AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT
 COULD ADD IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
 I THINK ABOUT A BILLION OR 20
 BILLION OR SO IN REVENUE, THAT
 PROBABLY EQUATES TO ABOUT 10% IN
 "S
 ANNUAL SERVICES GROWTHTHAT'SHE .
 THEN I THINK THERE'S A HIGHER
 LEVEL ORDER THAT APPLE IS
 SHOOTING FOR THAT GETS LIN
 THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS.
 THEY'VE BEEN LARGELY ANTICIPATED
 AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSUMERS
 WANT THIS REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT
 EFFECTIVELY WHAT APPLE IS
 SAYING, THEY'LL TAKE THINGS WE
 INTERACT WITH EVERY DAY WHETHER
 A SCREAMING SER-STREAMING SERE
 OR CREDIT CARD AND IT'S
 ENRICHING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND I
 RECOGNIZE WHEN I USE THAT
 LANGUAGE IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
 I'M JUST REPEATING WHAT THEIR
 MESSAGE BUT I THINK IT IS AN
 IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TRYING TO
 CREATE CONTENT NOT ABOUT THE
 TYPICACONTL T WE'VE SEEN, THIS
 ENRICHED CONTENT, GAMING MORE
 HEALTHY GAMING AND FIRST TIME A
 CREDIT CARD CAN ACTUALLY ADD
 TRANSPARENCY AND THAT GETS LOST
  THE CONVERSATION TODAY.
 THESE SUBTLE LITTLE APPROACHES
 THAT APPLE DOES TO MAKE OUR
 LIVES JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER
 AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WILL
 YIELD A HIGHER SHARE PRICE
 I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE
 ANNOUNCEMENT.
 IT TAKES THE SERVICES
 BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL, SO
 TO SPEAK
 YEAH, DEFINITELY ONHE VIDEO
 SIDE, ON THE CREDIT CARD
 WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS SOMETHING
 THAT I THINK OTHER CREDIT CARDC
 TRY TO ADD THAT LAYER OF
 TRANSPARENCY
 REALLY SHIFTING THE FOCUS FROM
 MAKING MONEY AS AN ISSUER TO TRY
 TO -APPLE IS NOT GOING TO MAKE
 A TON OF MONEY OFF THE CDIT
 CARD
 I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.
 THIS IN FIVE YEARS CAN BE CALL
 IT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLAR
 BUSINESS, MUCH SMALLER THAN THE
 $15 BILLION BUT THE INTERESTING
 PART JUST TO GO ONE MORE LEVEL
 DEEPER ON THE CREDIT CARD, THE
 EXCITING PART, IF YOU LOOK AT
 THE OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS THERE
 ARE VARIATIONS TO A BETTER
 DEGREE THAWE'VE SEEN BEFORE
 BUT THE CREDIT CARD, THAT
 ACTUALLY WAS A MAMEASURABLE
 I THINK THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE
 OF WHAT AN ADVANTAGE THAT APPLE
 HAS OF TYING TOGETHER THE
 HARDWARE, SOFT AND SERVICES.
 GENE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
 INVESTMENT THEY'RE PUTTING IN
 AND TRYING TO BECOME A
 COMPETITOR OF NETFLIX, WERE YOU
 UNDERWHELMED BY THE AMOUNT OF
 INVESTMENTS, SHOULD THAT BE 10X
 OR THE FACT TO YOUR POINT IT'S
 FOUR SERVICES SO THEY'RE TRYING
 TO FOCUS ON ALL OF THEM AND NOT
 JUST ONE OF THEM AND THEN MORE
 OF AN AGGREGATOR VERSUS A DIRECT
 COMPETITOR TO SO MANY SERVICES
 THEY'RE OFFERING
 I THINK THEY WANTED TO TRY TO
 BUNDLE ALL THESE SERVICE
 ANNOUNCEMENTS TOGETHER
 A LOGICAL TIME OF THE YEAR TO DO
 THAT
 WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO
 PREANNOUNCE THINGS AND DON'T
 HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL SO LET'S
 TALK ABOUT THE VIDEO REAL
 QUICKLY.
 IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY SHOWS AND
 MOVIES THEY HAVE
 MOST LIKELY PROBABLY AROUND 40
 WHICH IS A FAR CRY FROM NETFLIX
 AT A THOUSAND ORIGINAL SERIES.
 BUT I THINK THE QUALITY OF THIS
 IS WHAT IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY
 STAND OUT AND I SUSPECT THE WAY
 APPLE WILL MEASURE THEIR SUCCESS
 IS THE NUMBER OF INDTRY
 AWARDS
 I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT
 ENTERTAINMENT AND THE AWARDS
 THEY'LL GUN FOR BUT AT THE
 OF THE DAY THIS CONTENT, THIS
 DIFFERENT APPROACH IS GOING TO
 HAVE AN IMPACT AND THINK THAT
 COULD BE A SIMILAR SIZE BUSINESS
 AS NETFLIX CALLS IT, $15 BILLION
 A YEAR
 I AM IN THE CAMP IT WILL HAVE A
 NEGATIVE IMPACT OVER THE NEXT
 YEAR.
 HOW DO YOU JUDGE THE STOCK
 TODAY GIVEN THE FACT IT HAD SUCH
 A BIG RUN INTO THE
 ANNOUNCEMENTS?
 I THINK IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE
 OF HOW THESE APPLE EVENTS SET
 UP
 WE GENERALLY KNOW WHAT'S
 HAPPENING GOING INTO IT BUT THE
 SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT'S ANNOUNCED
 REALLY DOESN'T BECOME MORE CLEAR
 TO US UNTIL QUARTERS AND YEARS
 AHEAAND I THINK I JUDGE THE
 SIGNIFICANCE AS APPLE IS MAKING
 A STATEMENT AND GOING AFTER
 SERVICES BUT THEY'RE ALSO TAKING
 A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SERVICE.
 THAT DIFFERENT APPROACH IS
 ENRICHING LIVES AND MORE HEALTHY
 GAME CONTENT
 SO I VIEW THIS AS A POSITIVE IN
 LINE WITH APPLE'S BRAND AND
 MENTIONED SECURITY IF YOU'RE
 INTERESTED AND PLAYING BUZZWORD
 BINGO SEVEN TIMES THEY ARE HEAVY
 ON THAT THEME AS WELL WHICH I
 THINK IS SOMETHING UNIQUE APPLE
 CAN ADD TO THESE SERVICE.
 THIS MUST TAKE A DEAL FOR A
 CONTENT COMPANY OFF THE TABLE.
 WHAT WOULD -WHAT WOD IT
 TAKE TO -I MISSED THAT.
 I'M SAYING THESE KIND OF
 ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD TAKE A DEAL
 FOR ANY KIND OF CONTENT COMPANY
 BY APPLE OFF THE TABLE
 I THINK LARGELY YOU'RE RIGHT
 BECAUSE I THINK WHAT IT SHOWS
 THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING
 DIFFERENT.
 DO IT THEMSELVES.
 I DON'T THINK THEY'LL ACQUIRE
 NET FLISHGS.
 CBS, THEY'LL ACQUIRE SOME TYPE
 OF CONTENT
 THEY WOULD HAVE TO KILL A LOT OF
 THE CONTENT SO I THINK IT
 LARGELY DOES TAKE THAT OFF THE
 TABLE.
 GENE, THANKS.
 GOOD TO TALK TO YOU AS ALWAYS.
 GUY.
 BEGIN, GENE, HE NAILS IT.
 50% RETRACEMENT OFF THE ALL-TIME
 HIGH
 THE 50 DAY MOVING AGE COMING
 IN AROUND 175.
 I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO THINK
 BEFORE EARNINGS ON APRIL 30th
 APPLE RETESTS THAT 175 LEVEL.
 I THINK THEY MISS THE MARKET
 AS FAR AS VIDEO CONTENT.
 THAT'S NOT WHY PEOPLE HAVE KNELT
 APPLICATION AND NETFLIX AND
 CHILL.
 NETFLIX'S ORIGINAL CONTENT IS
 LESS THAN 8% OF THEIR VIEWABLE
 HOURS.
 APPLE IS SO FAR AWAY
 OPRAH TV ON APPLE TV WON'T BE
 THE REASON WHY THE ECOSYSTEM
 USES THEIR SERVICE SO THIS IS
 GOING TO BE A DUD FOR A BID.
 BANK STOCKS GETTING CRUSHED.
 GET A LOT WORSE FOR ONE KEY ULD
 GROUP.
 HE'LL BE HERE TO TELL YOU WHICH
 ONE.
 PLUS, TESLA IS SINKING AFTER RBC
 SLASHES ITS PRICE TARGET ON THE
 ELECTRIC CARMAKER.
 THE STOCK JUST DID SOMETHING
 THAT COULD SIGNAL A U-TURN AHEAD
 AND LATER GUY IS STEPPING UP TO
 THE PLATE WITH ONE STOCK HE SAYS
