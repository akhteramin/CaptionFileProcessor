CLOSING BELL WILL BE RIGHT CLOSING BELL WILL BE RIGHT BACK The day after chemo might mean a trip back to the doctor's office just for a shot. But why go back there when you can stay home with Neulasta Onpro? Strong chemo can put you at risk of serious infection. In a key study Neulasta reduced the risk of infection from 17% to 1%, a 94% decrease. Neulasta Onpro is designed to deliver Neulasta the day after chemo and is used by most patients today. Neulasta is for certain cancer patients receiving strong chemotherapy. Do not take Neulasta if you're allergic to it or Neupogen (filgrastim). An incomplete dose could increase infection risk. Ruptured spleen, sometimes fatal as well as serious lung problems, allergic reactions, kidney injuries and capillary leak syndrome have occurred. Report abdominal or shoulder tip pain, trouble breathing or allergic reactions to your doctor right away. In patients with sickle cell disorders, serious, sometimes fatal crises can occur. The most common side effect is bone and muscle ache. If you'd rather be home, ask your doctor about Neulasta Onpro. Pay no more than $5 per dose with copay card.
