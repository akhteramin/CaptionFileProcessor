 LOOK AT THE TIME I'VE GONE LONG.
 SO I'M OUT OF HERE.
 TAKE IT AWAY, KENDIS.
 YOU CAN HANG OUT AND DO THE
 NEXT TWO HOURS IF YOU'D LIKE.
 NO, NO, NO.
 WELCOME, EVERYBODY.
 I'M KENDIS GIBSON WITH A VERY
 BUSY NEWS HOUR AHEAD OF US.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SOUTH FLORIDA
 ARRIVING FOR DAY 172nd OF HIS
 GOLF COURSES.
 HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN IS
 SPENDING TODAY AT HIS DONE FOR
 MUCH OF THE LAST NINE MONTHS,
 LOCKED UP.
 PAUL MANAFORT'S RECKONING COULD
 COME NEXT WEEK WHEN HE FACES A
 MAXIMUM SENTENCE OF TEN YEARS IN
 PRISON IN HIS D.C. CASE AFTER
 PLEADING GUILTY TO CONSPIRING TO
 OBSTRUCT JUSTICE AND DEFRAUDING
 THE GOVERNMENT.
 STILL THERE IS OUTRAGE, HOWEVER,
 OVER MANAFORT'S SHOCKINGLY
 LENIENT SENTENCE OF 47 MONTHS IN
 PRISON FOR BANK AND TAX FRAUD,
 WELL BELOW THE FEDERAL
 GUIDELINES RANGE OF 19 TO 24
 YEARS.
 THE VIRGINIA JUDGE IN THE CASE
 CALLING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 GUIDELINES EXCESSIVE AND TOTALLY
 OUT OF WHACK.
 WELL, HERE'S THE PRESIDENT ON
 THE SENTENCING.
 I FEEL VERY BADLY FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY, VERY
 TOUGH TIME FOR HIM, BUT IF YOU
 NOTICE, BOTH HIS LAWYER, A
 HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN AND A VERY
 HIGHLY RESPECTED JUDGE, THE
 JUDGE, SAID THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
 MIKE VIQUEIRA IS JOINING US
 AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOLLOWING THE
 DEVELOPMENT AND, MIKE, IT SEEMED
 AS IF THE PRESIDENT LOOKED AS IF
 SOME SORT OF VINDICATION, THE
 LENIENT SENTENCING FOR MANAFORT?
 Reporter: WELL, IN A SENSE,
 BUT THE PRESIDENT MISREPRESENTED
 WHAT THE JUDGE SAID.
 THE JUDGE SAID THAT PAUL
 MANAFORT WAS NOT BEFORE HIS
 COURT FOR THE PURPOSE OF
 INVESTIGATING COLLUSION WITH
 RUSSIA OR RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE
 IN THE U.S. ELECTION, RATHER HE
 WAS BEING SENTENCED FOR BANK
 FRAUD AS WELL AS TAX EVASION AND
 YOU'RE RIGHT TO POINT OUT,
 KENDIS, THAT NEXT WEDNESDAY
 COMES ANOTHER RECKONING FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT WHERE HE APPEARS AT A
 DIFFERENT FEDERAL COURT JUST
 DOWN THE STREET HERE AT THE FOOT
 OF CAPITOL HILL IN THE FEDERAL
 COURTROOM OF JUDGE AMY BIRMEN
 JACKSON WHO IS SENTENCING HIM ON
 SEPARATE CHARGES INVOLVING THE
 ILLEGAL LOBBYING THAT HE HAS
 DONE FOR THE -FOR UKRAINE OVER
 THE YEARS.
 HE COULD GET UP TO TEN YEARS FOR
 THAT AS WELL, ALTHOUGH THE
 SENTENCES COULD RUN
 CONCURRENTLY.
 IN THE VIRGINIA CASE IN THE
 SENTENCING JUST THE OTHER NIGHT
 ON THURSDAY NIGHT, HE DOES GET
 CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED, SO THAT
 FOUR YEARS HE WAS SENTENCED FOR
 WELL UNDER THE GUIDELINES THAT
 COULD HAVE HAD HIM LOCKED UP FOR
 AS MUCH AS 24 YEARS IS ALREADY
 NINE MONTHS TO THE GOOD FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 THE PRESIDENT EMBRACING WHAT THE
 JUDGE SAID IN THAT THE JUDGE
 TELLING MANAFORT THAT HE'S
 LARGELY A BLAMELESS LIFE TILL
 NOW.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD TAKE ISSUE
 WITH THAT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
 WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH THE JUDGE
 AND THE PERSONALITY THAT HE
 INJECTED INTO THE COURTROOM IN
 SOME OF HIS OWN PERSONAL VIEWS
 OVER THE COURSE OF THAT TRIAL
 AND YET PAUL MANAFORT WHO IS NOW
 FRAIL, IN A WHEELCHAIR,
 SUFFERING FROM GOUT IN A GREEN
 PRISON JUMP SUIT WITH THE WORD
 ALEXANDRIA INMATE STEN SILD ON
 THE BACK WAS A FIGURE IN
 DECLINING HEALTH APPARENTLY
 AGAIN FACES THE MUSIC ON
 WEDNESDAY WHEN HE APPEARS IN
 FEDERAL COURT FOR HIS SENTENCING
 IN A SECOND CASE BROUGHT BY THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL, KENDIS.
 IT SEEMS THAT WITH SOME NEW
 LAWS THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY END
 UP JUST SPENDING 22 MONTHS
 BEHIND LAWS AFTER ALL OF THIS.
 OUR MIKE VIQUEIRA THERE AT THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 FOR MORE ON THIS LET'S BRING
 IN OUR PANEL, SOPHIA NELSON AND
 GLENN KIRCHNER, AN MGS LEGAL
 ANALYST, ANN GAREN, WHITE HOUSE
 CORRESPONDENT AT "THE WASHINGTON
 POST" AND CHARLIE SAVAGE, MSNBC
 CONTRIBUTOR.
 WARM WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.
 THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE
 WITH US.
 GLENN, LET'S START WITH YOU.
 WAS THIS AN INJUSTICE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I HEARD IN YOUR LEAD-IN, KENDIS,
 THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING
 THAT MUELLER'S GUIDELINES WERE
 UNFAIR.
 THESE ARE NOT MUELLER'S
 GUIDELINES.
 THERE IS A GUIDELINE COMMISSION
 THAT CAME UP WITH THESE
 GUIDELINES, A LOT OF DEEP
 THINKERS, FORMER LAWYERS AND
 FORMER JUDGES AND SO WHAT THEY
 DID WAS THEY SAID, OKAY, FOR
 THIS KIND OF OFFENDER, PAUL
 MANAFORT AND FOR THESE KIND OF
 OFFENSES, WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE
 GUIDELINE RANGE?
 THAT'S NOT MUELLER SPECIFIC.
 THAT'S EVERY FEDERAL COURT IN
 THE COUNTRY AND A GUIDELINE
 RANGE FOR THIS OFFENDER AND
 THESE CRIMES CAME OUT TO BE 19.5
 TO 24 YEARS.
 NOW THERE ARE WAYS THAT JUDGES
 CAN GO BELOW THAT, ONE WAY IS IF
 SOMEBODY APOLOGIZES AND TAKES
 RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE DID.
 THE JUDGE SAID HE DIDN'T DO
 THAT.
 ANOTHER WAY IS IF YOU PROVIDE
 SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE
 PROSECUTORS.
 MANAFORT DIDN'T DO THAT.
 IN FACT, HE LIED TO THE
 PROSECUTORS UNDER THE GUISE OF
 COOPERATING.
 THERE WAS NO LAWFUL BASIS FOR
 THE JUDGE TO DEPART DOWNWARD THE
 WAY HE DID.
 IT DOESN'T MAKE IT AN ILLEGAL
 SENTENCE, BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE
 BEEN A MORE UNJUST SENTENCE.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
 ARE BEHIND BARS FOR DOING A LOT
 LESS.
 I DO RECALL ONE WOMAN IN TEXAS
 WHO GOT FIVE YEARS --
 FOR TRYING TO VOTE.
 VOTING ILLEGALLY.
 WHAT DOES THIS SAY TO THE PUBLIC
 ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 SYSTEM?
 FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO DEAL
 WITH THE ISSUE OF PRIVILEGE.
 WHITE COLLAR CRIMINALS HAVE
 ALWAYS BEEN GIVEN PRIVILEGE IN
 THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
 THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES ARE
 EXACTLY AS YOU SAY, THEY ARE
 THERE FOR A REASON BECAUSE THEY
 WANT YOU TO STAY WITHIN THOSE
 GUIDELINES.
 JUDGES ALWAYS HAVE DISCRETION,
 BUT IN THIS ISSUE OF PAUL
 MANAFORT, HERE'S A MAN THAT HAD
 SIX PASSPORTS, IS ALLEGED TO
 HAVE DONE ALL KIND OF THINGS
 WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENTS, NOT IN THE BEST
 INTEREST PROBABLY OF THE UNITED
 STATES IN MANY WAYS.
 HERE'S A GUY THAT I DON'T FEEL
 LIKE RUSSIAN COLLUSION HAS OR
 HASN'T BEEN PROVEN YET BECAUSE
 MUELLER HASN'T, YOU KNOW, ISSUED
 HIS REPORT.
 THE POINT IS THIS, HOWEVER,
 LEAVE IT TO JUDGE JACKSON.
 I BELIEVE SHE'S GOING TO STEP IN
 AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WOMAN
 TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS AND SHE'S
 PRETTY TOUGH.
 YOU SAW HOW SHE DEALT WITH ROGER
 STONE.
 I THINK SHE'S GOING TO RECTIFY
 THIS, NOT BECAUSE SHE'S ON A
 POLICY RANT OR SOME SOCIAL
 JUSTICE RANT BUT BECAUSE SHE
 GETS THE NEXT SHOT AT THIS.
 AMY JACKSON THERE IN D.C.
 WILL BE TAKING UP THE MANAFORT
 CASE ON WEDNESDAY.
 WE'LL BE TAKING UP THAT GAG
 ORDER AGAINST ROGER STONE ON
 MONDAY.
 MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE
 MUELLER TEAM TOOK AN "L" HERE,
 THAT THEY TOOK THE LOSS.
 THE MUELLER TEAM HAS A BYE
 THAT THIS IS NOT THEIR CASE.
 THEY HANDED OFF A FAIR AMOUNT OF
 THE, YOU KNOW, CRIMINAL SIDE OF
 THIS TO FEDERAL JUDGES AND THEY,
 YOU KNOW -THEY GAVE -THERE
 WAS A BROAD MANDATE TO PROSECUTE
 MANAFORT ON THINGS THAT WERE
 VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE MANDATE
 TO LOOK INTO RUSSIA AND ALLEGED
 COLLUSION AND SO FORTH, SO IF
 YOU -IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
 THE MUELLER CASE IN TERMS OF ARE
 THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO PIN
 SOMETHING ON THE PRESIDENT, THE
 MANAFORT CASE WAS ALWAYS SORT OF
 OFF TO ONE SIDE.
 WE DON'T KNOW YET AND WE DIDN'T
 LEARN MUCH, FRANKLY, IN THE
 COURSE OF THE MANAFORT
 PROCEEDINGS ABOUT WHAT ALL OF
 THAT SEPARATE LINE OF INQUIRY
 WAS GOING TO BE, THE MANAFORT
 CASE WAS LARGELY ABOUT THINGS
 THAT MANAFORT DID BEFORE HE EVER
 WENT TO WORK FOR DONALD TRUMP
 AND SO IT'S SORT OF -YOU HAVE
 TO LOOK AT IT AS ITS OWN ANIMAL.
 JUSTICE WILL COME BACK FOR
 PAUL MANAFORT AS FAR AS MUELLER
 IS CONCERNED.
 CHARLIE, THERE'S AN INTERESTING
 MESSAGE FROM PAUL MANAFORT'S
 LAWYER THAT HE SAID AFTER THE
 SENTENCING.
 LISTEN.
 I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT
 YOU SAW TODAY IS THE SAME THING
 THAT WE HAD SAID FROM DAY ONE,
 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE
 THAT PAUL MANAFORT WAS INVOLVED
 WITH ANY COLLUSION WITH ANY
 GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL FROM RUSSIA.
 INTERESTING TALKING POINT.
 SOUNDED SIMILAR TO WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT SAID JUST ABOUT 12 OR
 24 HOURS LATER.
 WAS THIS A DELIBERATE APPEAL FOR
 A PARDON FROM THE PRESIDENT?
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
 INSIDE OF HIS HEAD.
 ONE THING THAT WAS INTERESTING
 ABOUT IT, THE WORD GOVERNMENT
 OFFICIAL, BECAUSE ONE OF THE
 THINGS THAT THE MANAFORT TRIAL
 DID BRING TO LIGHT THAT HE
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHILE
 WORKING FOR DONALD TRUMP HAD
 SHARED INTERNAL POLLING DATA
 WITH KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK, THAT
 RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN THAT THE
 GOVERNMENT SAYS HAS LINKS TO THE
 RUSSIAN GRU INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 THAT HAD HACKED THE DEMOCRATIC
 EMAILS.
 I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS --
 AMOUNTS TO COLLUSION BUT IT WAS
 SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY ACTION.
 THE OTHER THING TO PAY ATTENTION
 TO HERE, OF COURSE, IS NOT ONLY
 DOES JUDGE JACKSON HAVE THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO SENTENCE HIM TO
 UP TO TEN YEARS THAT WOULD RUN
 AFTER THESE 47 MONTHS, IF SHE
 WANTS TO, BUT HE HAS ALREADY
 AGREED TO FORFEIT SOMETHING LIKE
 $46 MILLION IN ASSETS UNRELATED
 TO THE JAIL TIME HE'S GOING TO
 RECEIVE HERE.
 THAT PENALTY IS ANOTHER GIGANTIC
 PIECE OF DISCIPLINE THAT SHOULD
 BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION OF
 WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM.
 SO YOU'LL HAVE MANAFORT IN
 FRONT OF AMY JACKSON.
 LET ME ASK YOU THIS BECAUSE YOU
 TWEETED THIS.
 DON'T DESPAIR AT TODAY'S
 HORRIFIC INJUSTICE AT THE HANDS
 OF JUDGE ELLIS, THE CONSPIRACY
 INDICTMENT IS COMING, IN MY
 OPINION.
 DON'T CONFUSE MUELLER'S SILENCE
 ON THE CONSPIRACY FRONT WITH
 LACK OF EVIDENCE ON CONSPIRACY.
 JUSTICE IS COMING BACK.
 WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, AFTER
 SPENDING 30 YEARS AS A
 PROSECUTOR, THE EVIDENCE I HAVE
 SEEN EVEN IN THE PUBLIC
 REPORTING TELLS ME THAT THERE
 WAS A CONSPIRACY BETWEEN THE
 CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.
 WE'VE SEEN IT OVER AND OVER
 AGAIN, THEN THERE WERE ALL SORTS
 OF ACTS UNDERTAKEN THAT
 OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE, THAT TRIED
 TO PREVENT THE EVIDENCE OF THAT
 CONSPIRACY COMING TO LIGHT.
 SO EVERYBODY HAS CONFUSED
 MUELLER'S SILENCE ON THE
 QUESTION OF CONSPIRACY AND
 COLLUSION WITH AN ABSENCE OF
 EVIDENCE OF CONSPIRACY.
 YOU THINK THE COLLUSION BOMB
 IS STILL COMING.
 THE COLLUSION BOMB IS COMING
 AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
 MUELLER IS SO STRATEGIC IN WHAT
 HE'S DOING, I DON'T THINK HE
 WANTED TO TIP HIS HAND ON
 COLLUSION.
 I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO, FOR
 EXAMPLE, INDICT ONE OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN FOR SOME OF
 THE CRIMES THEY COMMITTED
 BECAUSE THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED
 IN TRUMP TRYING TO SHUT THINGS
 DOWN.
 I AGREE WITH HIM, BUT AT THE
 VERY BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR THE
 PRESIDENT, IT WAS RECKLESS
 ABJECT GREED, GIVE ME SOME WORDS
 HERE FOR WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO
 BECAUSE BUSINESS FOR HIM AND
 CRIMINALITY PERHAPS, ET CETERA,
 I THINK THEY ALL MERGE TOGETHER.
 I DON'T THINK THEY THINK ALONG
 THOSE LINES AND KUSHNER, LET US
 NOT FORGET, NOT TO IMPUGN
 PEOPLE'S PARENTS, HIS FATHER WAS
 CONVICT THE BY CHRIS CHRISTIE
 AND IN MOST WHITE HOUSES AND IN
 MOST GOVERNMENTS, SOMEONE WHO
 HAD A FAMILY HISTORY WITH A
 FELON, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE
 BAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FELON IN
 THE FAMILY, BUT SOME OF THIS
 BEHAVIOR WITH MBS ON JARED
 KUSHNER'S PART IS JUST
 PROBLEMATIC.
 THESE GUYS DON'T CARE ABOUT LAW,
 JUSTICE, INTEGRITY.
 THEY DON'T.
 THEY DON'T.

 ROGER STONE GOING TO JAIL ON
 MONDAY?
 I THINK --
 IT'S A QUICK YES OR NO.
 I THINK NOT.
 I DO.
 ALL RIGHT.
 SOPHIA AND GLENN, STICK AROUND.
 ANNA AND CHARLIE, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH.
 SO SHOW ME THE MONEY.
 WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN
 MAR-A-LAGO COLLECTING CASH,
 BERNIE SANDERS IS IN THE HAWKEYE
 STATE TRYING TO COLLECT
 SUPPORTERS.
 PLUS, ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE,
 HOW CLOSE JOE BIDEN IS TO MAKING
 A DECISION ABOUT 2020.
    If you have postmenopausal    osteoporosis
   and a high risk for fracture
  now might not be the best time  to ask yourself
       are my bones strong?
  Life is full of make-or-break  moments.
   That's why it's so important
   to help reduce your risk of   fracture with Prolia®.
  Only Prolia® is proven to help  strengthen
 and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months.
 Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant,
   are allergic to it, or take   XGEVA®.
   Serious allergic reactions,
 like low blood pressure; trouble breathing;
 throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling;
   rash; itching; or hives have   happened.
  Tell your doctor about dental  problems
 as severe jaw bone problems may happen
  or new or unusual pain in your  hip groin, or thigh,
 as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred.
   Speak to your doctor before   stopping Prolia®
     as spine and other bone     fractures have occurred.
  Prolia® can cause serious side  effects,
 like low blood calcium, serious infections,
 which could need hospitalization, skin problems,
    and severe bone, joint, or    muscle pain.
          Are you ready?
 Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones.     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.

 SOME BIG CROWDS ARE SHOWING
 UP FOR AN ALREADY CROWDED FIELD.
 THE BEAT TRUMP FERVOR AT "NEW
 YORK TIMES" IS CALLING IT IS
 ENERGIZING DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
 TO RUN AND VOTERS TO TURN OUT AT
 MASSIVE EVENTS ALL ACROSS THE
 COUNTRY AS THE TIMES WRITES,
 POWERED BY AN ALMOST DESPERATE
 YEARNING TO OUST PRESIDENT TRUMP
 AND GALVANIZED BY THE MOST
 DIVERSE FIELD IN PRESIDENTIAL
 PRIMARY HISTORY, DEMOCRATS ARE
 PACKING INTO GYMS AND CHURCHES
 TO HEAR THE CANDIDATES SPEAK.
 EVEN IF THEY ARE FAR FROM
 COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE
 CANDIDATE, THEY ARE SHOWING UP
 TO SEE.
 LET'S BRING IN J SHAQUILLE
 BREWSTER.
 WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE TODAY IN
 DES MOINES?
 Reporter: WELL, IT WASN'T THE
 12 OR 13,000 THAT WE SAW IN
 NEW YORK AND CHICAGO, CAMPAIGN
 SAYS IT WAS ABOUT 1,300 PEOPLE
 THAT SHOWED UP HERE IN DES
 MOINES WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH
 THE OTHER EVENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN
 FROM BERNIE SANDERS DURING THIS
 FIRST TRIP BACK TO IOWA AS AN
 OFFICIAL 2020 PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATE AND I'VE BEEN TALKING
 TO A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE AT THESE
 RALLIES BEFORE THE EVENTS AND
 THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE 100%
 WITH BERNIE SANDERS.
 THERE'S OTHERS LIKE ASHLEY DOOR
 WHO ARE STILL ON THE FENCE.
 LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY
 EARLIER.
 IN THE PAST I HAVEN'T BEEN
 VERY INVOLVED POLITICALLY AND
 THIS YEAR, I JUST WANT TO GET
 OUT AND LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN
 ABOUT CANDIDATES.
 I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT THEY
 STAND FOR, WHAT ARE THE ISSUES
 THEY'RE REALLY PULLING FOR.
 RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY WE'RE
 IN A SPOT WHERE IT'S EITHER WE
 FIGURE IT OUT OR WE KEEP GOING
 IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE
 GOING.
 Reporter: AND ASHLEY TEXTED
 ME AFTERWARDS SAYING THAT SHE
 FEELS LIKE BERNIE IS THE
 PEOPLE'S CANDIDATE, SHE CAME IN
 UNDECIDED BUT IS NOW LEANING
 MORE TO SANDERS.
 SANDERS IS GOING TO
 NEW HAMPSHIRE LATER, THEN HE'S
 GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA LATER IN
 THE WEEK AND HE REALLY IS
 COMMITTED TO FIGHTING THIS
 FIGHT.
 HE SAYS THAT UNLIKE 2016, WHEN
 HE WAS A FRINGE CANDIDATE WHO
 JUST CAME ABOUT AND STARTED AT
 3% IN THE POLL, THIS TIME AROUND
 HE HAS THE ISSUES ON HIS SIDE
 AND HE'S HAPPY TO SEE MUCH OF
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BACKING HIS
 SIDE.
 HE ACTUALLY MADE A NOTE EARLIER
 TODAY TO SAY THAT HE DOES EXPECT
 TO WIN BUT IF HE DOES NOT WIN,
 HE DOES PLAN ON SUPPORTING THE
 DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE.
 THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT'S
 NOTABLE BECAUSE HE'S RECEIVED
 CRITICISM FROM SOME WHO SAY THAT
 HE DIDN'T COME OUT FOR SECRETARY
 CLINTON AFTER HE LOST IN 2016,
 THAT HE DIDN'T COME OUT FOR HER
 FORCEFULLY OR QUICKLY ENOUGH.
 IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THAT
 CHANGE IN TONE.
 BACK TO YOU.
 IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN THE RUB
 ON HIM FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS OR
 SO.
 I DO WANT TO ASK YOU THIS, AT
 LEAST WITH ASHLEY AND IN THAT
 PARTICULAR SHOT, THEY APPEAR TO
 BE FAIRLY YOUNG AND THAT WAS
 BERNIE'S BIG THING ABOUT TWO
 YEARS AGO, GETTING THE YOUNG
 PEOPLE.
 WHAT WAS THE MAKE-UP LIKE THERE
 IN DES MOINES?
 Reporter: A LOT OF YOUNG
 PEOPLE, HE WAS ON A COLLEGE
 CAMPUS YESTERDAY IN IOWA CITY
 AND HE MADE A POINT.
 IT WAS ONE OF HIS APPLAUSE LINES
 THAT BACK IN 2016 HE RECEIVED
 MORE VOTES FROM YOUNG PEOPLE
 THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
 SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON
 COMBINED, SO HE LIKES THE FACT
 THAT HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE
 YOUNG PEOPLE.
 THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE I'VE
 MET OVER THESE PAST COUPLE OF
 DAYS WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO VOTE IN

 THEY VOLUNTEERED, THEY MADE
 CALLS FOR HIM BUT THEY WEREN'T
 ABLE TO CAST A BALLOT.
 IT IS NOW THEIR TIME TO VOTE AND
 THEY PLAN ON COMING OUT AND
 SUPPORTING HIM, SENATOR SANDERS
 SAYS THAT HE IS OVER 7,000
 PEOPLE WHO ALREADY SIGNED UP
 JUST HERE IN IOWA TO HELP
 VOLUNTEER FOR HIM.
 HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING THAT
 SUPPORT.
 I GUESS THAT YOUNG SUPPORT IS
 RELATIVE WHEN YOU'RE 77 YEARS
 OLD, OF COURSE, THOSE NUMBERS
 MAKE SENSE TO YOU.
 SHAQUILLE BREWSTER, THANK YOU.
 REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND
 AUTHOR, NOELLE.
 I WANT TO PLAY SOUND FROM
 BERNIE SANDERS TODAY.
 JUST MOMENTS AGO, GET YOUR TAKE
 ON THE OTHER SIDE.

 I HOPE VERY MUCH TWO THINGS,
 NUMBER ONE, THAT THE NATURE OF
 OUR CAMPAIGN IS NOT BELITTLING
 PEOPLE, IT'S NOT OPPOSITION
 RESEARCH, IT'S NOT ATTACKING
 OTHER PEOPLE, BUT IS A SERIOUS
 DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANT
 ISSUES FACING THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE.
 IF WE DO NOT WIN, I WILL
 STRONGLY SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATIC
 NOMINEE AND HOPE THAT -AND
 HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT OTHERS
 FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.
 DONALD TRUMP MUST BE DEFEATED.
 ED, DO YOU HEAR RIGHT THERE
 THE BIGGEST APPLAUSE LINE RIGHT
 NOW, IT IS ABOUT BEATING TRUMP.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU HEAR
 THAT MESSAGE THERE FROM SANDERS?
 WELL, OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE
 NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE
 ENTIRE PARTY AND PROBABLY FOR
 MUCH OF THE NATION.
 2016 LEFT PEOPLE VERY
 DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY AND
 THANKFULLY THAT ENERGY WAS MOVED
 INTO ACTUALLY TAKING THE HOUSE
 BACK IN 2018.
 I THINK WE'RE SEEING VERY EARLY
 ON AN EVEN MORE INTENSE ENERGY,
 POSITIVE ENERGY TO TAKE THE
 HOUSE BACK.
 ON THE FLIP SIDE -TO TAKE THE
 WHITE HOUSE BACK.
 THE FLIP SIDE WHEN I LISTEN TO
 BERNIE IS SORT OF A, HERE WE GO
 AGAIN.
 YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SAY, IF I
 LOSE I'M GOING TO BACK UP THE
 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE.
 THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
 THAT IS AN INDICATION OF A PRIOR
 PROBLEM AND AS SOMEONE WHO
 WORKED FOR HILLARY CLINTON BOTH
 IN 2008 WHEN SHE LOST TO BARACK
 OBAMA AND THEN 2016 WHEN SHE
 BEAT BERNIE SANDERS, THERE
 REALLY WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 THE TWO.
 I REMEMBER SOMEONE ADDING UP
 EVERYTHING THAT HILLARY DID FOR
 PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SHE DID MORE
 EVENTS AND RAISED MORE MONEY FOR
 HIM THAN SARAH PALIN DID FOR
 JOHN McCAIN AND BERNIE SANDERS,
 IF HE DOESN'T WIN, HE NEEDS TO
 DO THAT SAME THING AND INSTEAD,
 WE ARE TAKING PLEDGES ABOUT
 WHETHER YOU WILL REMAIN A
 DEMOCRAT.
 THAT'S A PROBLEM.
 MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
 POINTING OUT THAT HE IS AN
 INDEPENDENT.
 HE'S SAYING HE'S A PROUD
 DEMOCRAT AT LEAST IN THIS RACE.
 NOELLE, MY COLLEAGUES PUBLISHED
 AN INTERESTING PIECE DISCUSSING
 SANDERS' CHALLENGES.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 THE FIRST CHALLENGE THEY SAY IS,
 CAN HE COMPETE IN A MUCH MORE
 CROWDED LIBERAL/PROGRESSIVE LANE
 THAN HE ENCOUNTERED IN 2016?
 HE'S GOT COMPANY FROM THE
 PROGRESSIVE, INCLUDING ELIZABETH
 WARREN TO THE LIKES OF KAMALA
 HARRIS, CORY BOOKER, KRISTIN
 JILL BRAND WHO ARE ALL RUNNING
 UNDER THE MEDICARE FOR ALL
 BANNER, WHERE DOES BERNIE RUN?
 WHAT IS HIS LANE?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, BERNIE'S
 GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
 EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING AND I
 THINK THAT HE'S ALREADY GOTTEN A
 GOOD GRIP ON THAT BY COMING OUT
 AND SAYING THAT HE'S PRETTY MUCH
 STATED, YOU KNOW, THE POLICY
 THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING
 AROUND AND THAT'S ONE OF THE
 THINGS IF YOU ARE IN THE BERNIE
 CAMP, YOU CAN SIT BACK AND GO,
 PRETTY MUCH I TOLD YOU SO.
 THIS IS THE MESSAGE.
 THIS IS THE NARRATIVE THAT'S
 REGISTERING AND THIS IS WHAT ALL
 THE NEW NEW CANDIDATES THAT ARE
 COMING FORTH ARE ALL PRETTY MUCH
 MIMICKING SOME OF THE ORIGINAL
 POINTS THAT BERNIE SANDERS MADE,
 SO OBVIOUSLY BERNIE SANDERS WHO
 GAVE HILLARY CLINTON A REAL RUN
 FOR HER MONEY REALLY RESONATED
 WITH NOT ONLY A LOT OF THE YOUNG
 DONORS, BUT -OR YOUNG VOTERS,
 BUT ALSO WITH A LOT OF THE BASE
 OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 LOOK AT SOME OF THE CONGRESSMEN
 THAT HAVE BEEN ELECTED AND THESE
 ARE VERY FAR LEFT LEANING
 CANDIDATES THAT WON.
 NOELLE, NOT TO -I DON'T
 THINK LOSING BY 4 MILLION VOTES
 IS GIVING SOMEONE A RUN FOR
 THEIR MONEY AND MOST OF THE
 CANDIDATES WHO WON IN 2018 DID
 SO ON A MORE MODERATE PLATFORM.
 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHAT BERNIE
 HAS DONE.
 THE PROBLEM FOR BERNIE MIGHT BE
 A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.
 THE FACT THAT HE HAS BROUGHT THE
 CONVERSATION TO THE ISSUES THAT
 HE WANTS, HE NOW HAS CREATED A
 SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE LIKE YOU
 SAID HAVE OPTIONS.
 THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS, AND
 THE QUESTION IS WHETHER HE HAS
 OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS MANAGED
 TO BRING TOGETHER THE PEOPLE
 THAT DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM AND IT
 DOES NOT SEEM LIKE HE'S BEEN
 VERY GOOD AT THAT.
 IT SEEMS LIKE TO SOME EXTENT HE
 HAS SQUANDERED THE LAST TWO
 YEARS.
 HE HAS TOO MANY OPTIONS.
 THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
 THERE ARE MANY REPORTS THAT
 HE'S PREPARING TO ANNOUNCE,
 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG AND SHERROD
 BROWN HAVE BOWED OUT, BUT HIS
 LIKELY ENTRANCE SEEMS TO HAVE
 BARELY CLEAR THE FIELD.
 IT REMAINS WIDE-OPEN.
 HOW DO YOU SEE HIM INFLUENCING
 THE CHANGES AND THE CHANCES OF
 OTHER DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW?
 I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT IT
 DOESN'T CLEAR THE FIELD.
 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF PEOPLE
 WANT TO RUN, IF THEY THINK THEY
 HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER, THAT
 THEY RUN.
 JOE BIDEN OBVIOUSLY HAS THE
 RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF
 MILLIONS OF DEMOCRATS, INCLUDING
 MYSELF.
 I THINK -I GIVE VICE PRESIDENT
 BIDEN A LOT OF CREDIT BECAUSE I
 THINK HE'S BEING VERY THOUGHTFUL
 AND METICULOUS ABOUT RUNNING OR
 THE DECISION TO RUN BECAUSE HE
 KNOWS THERE'S A GREAT CHANCE
 THAT HE DOESN'T WIN AND I THINK
 HE, YOU KNOW, MORE THAN
 ANYTHING, DOESN'T WANT TO REGRET
 NOT TAKING ANOTHER SHOT.
 OKAY.
 THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT, HE'S
 BEEN IN PUBLIC SERVICE FOR 40
 YEARS AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO
 BASICALLY START FROM SCRATCH AND
 EXPLAIN A LOT OF WHAT HE SAID
 AND CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT HE
 WOULD BE BETTER THAN KAMALA
 HARRIS OR ELIZABETH WARREN.
 AND 40 YEARS OF RECORD, A LOT
 OF IT IS COMING UP OVER THE LAST
 FEW WEEKS --
 EXPERIENCE HAS BECOME A DIRTY
 WORD NOW.
 IT REALLY HAS.
 OUR THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.
 IT'S 78 DEGREES WHERE YOU ARE
 WITH A WIND CHILL OF LIKE 90.
 TOUGH PROBLEMS.
 NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TO FLY ME
 TO FLORIDA TO DO WITH NOELLE IN
 PERSON.
 SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL.
 THANK YOU, GUYS.
 PARDON PROBLEMS.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS MICHAEL
 COHEN DIRECTLY ASKED HIM FOR A
 PARDON BUT HIS FORMER FIXER SAYS
 IT'S JUST ANOTHER SET OF LIES.
 IT'S A CASE OF HE SAID/HE SAID
 NEXT.
   Guys do whatever it takes to   deal with shave irritation.
 So, we re-imagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuard.
      It has a unique guard      between the blades.
   That's designed to reduce   irritation during the shave.
  Because we believe all men  deserve a razor just for them.
     The best a man can get.
            Gillette.
      I've always been amazed          by what's next.
   And still going for my best,
      even though I live with      a higher risk of stroke
     due to Afib not caused by      a heart valve problem.
 So if there's a better treatment         than warfarin...
         I want that too.
             ELIQUIS.
         ELIQUIS is proven
       to reduce stroke risk       better than warfarin.
    Plus has significantly less
   major bleeding than warfarin.
      ELIQUIS is FDA-approved           and has both.
           What's next?
      Reeling in a nice one.
    <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i>
 <i>as stopping increases your risk</i>       <i> of having a stroke.</i>
  <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i>  <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i>
  <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i>    <i> an artificial heart valve</i>
      <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>
      <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>    <i> you may bruise more easily</i>
   <i> and it may take longer than</i> <i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i>
   <i> Seek immediate medical care</i>   <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i>
      <i> like unusual bruising.</i>
    <i> ELIQUIS may increase your</i>          <i> bleeding risk</i>
  <i> if you take certain medicines.</i>
         <i> Tell your doctor</i>    <i> about all planned medical</i>
      <i> or dental procedures.</i>
      ELIQUIS, the number one
      cardiologist-prescribed          blood thinner.
    Ask your doctor if ELIQUIS
      is what's next for you.
 SO RELATIONSHIP EXPERTS SAY THERE ARE FIVE PHASES OF
 BREAK-UPS, DENIAL, ANGER,
 BARGAINING, DEPRESSION AND
 ACCEPTANCE.
 IT SEEMS LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP
 AND HIS FORMER FIXER ARE ADDING
 RETALIATION TO THEIR BREAK-UP.
 THE PRESIDENT GOING ALL CAPS,
 TAKE A LOOK ON THE TWEET
 BLASTING COHEN WITH, HE LIED AND
 GOING ON TO SAY COHEN DIRECTLY
 ASKED HIM FOR A PARDON.
 SO MINUTES LATER, COHEN
 RESPONDED BY CLAIMING, IT WAS
 JUST ANOTHER SET OF LIES BY HIS
 FORMER BOSS.
 THE PARDON TALKS PRESUMABLY
 HAPPENED BEFORE COHEN FLIPPED ON
 TRUMP AND THEIR WAR OF WORDS IS
 RAISING THE QUESTION, WHO
 OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE OR PERJURED
 FIRST?
 JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS CAROLINE
 PALESI.
 IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
 MISSED THE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE
 WOULD JUST GHOST EACH OTHER
 AFTER THE RELATIONSHIP BREAK-UP.
 LET ME START WITH YOU.
 WITH JUST ONE HOUR BEFORE
 SENDING OUT THAT TWEET THAT
 TRUMP WAS STILL -WAS SAYING
 THAT HIS LAWYERS WERE WATCHING
 EVERYTHING THAT WAS PLAYING OUT,
 THAT THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS
 BETWEEN HIS LAWYERS AND COHEN'S
 LAWYERS AS WELL.
 YEAH.
 WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE?
 IT LOOKS LIKE COHEN MAY HAVE
 FUDGED A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU
 ASSIMILATE ALL THE REPORTING
 WE'VE HEARD.
 HE MAY HAVE FUDGED A LITTLE BIT
 WHEN HE SAID HE NEVER ASKED FOR
 A PARDON, AND, OF COURSE, HIS
 OWN LAWYER CAME OUT AND SAID, HE
 DID AUTHORIZE ME TO EXPLORE IT
 WITH TRUMP'S LAWYERS.
 BUT HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, WHEN
 THE PRESIDENT SAYS IN A
 ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION MICHAEL
 COHEN ASKED ME FOR A PARDON,
 OKAY, FINE.
 DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU COULD CHARGE
 MICHAEL COHEN WITH PERJURY IF HE
 DID LIE TO CONGRESS?
 THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE TO WALK
 IN TO A GRAND JURY AND TESTIFY
 THAT MICHAEL COHEN -YOU THINK
 HE'S GOING TO DO THAT?
 HE WOULDN'T EVEN SIT DOWN FOR A
 VOLUNTARY INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER
 BECAUSE HE WAS SO SCARED AND HIS
 LAWYERS WERE SO SCARED OF HIM
 NOT BEING TRUTHFUL.
 SO THIS IS MUCH ADO ABOUT
 NOTHING.
 THIS IS A COOPERATOR NOT BEING
 100% STRAIGHT DURING HIS
 COOPERATION.
 WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME.
 THE BIG QUESTION MANY
 REPUBLICANS ARE WONDERING IS
 WHETHER OR NOT COHEN COMMITTED
 PERJURY ON FEBRUARY 27th WHEN HE
 WAS THERE IN FRONT OF CONGRESS
 AGAIN?
 HOW DO WE EVER KNOW?
 THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
 THIS IS A HE SAID/HE SAID.
 WHETHER OR NOT HE ASKED FOR A
 PARDON, AFTER THE FBI RAID IS
 WHEN I SUSPECT THERE WAS REAL
 FEAR IN COHEN CAMP.
 HE AND TRUMP WERE STILL BOYS
 THEN.
 WAS IT A DIRECT -YOU GOT TO
 PARDON ME?
 PROBABLY NOT.
 WAS IT A LITTLE SLIPPERY?
 PROBABLY SO.
 THEY'RE BROMANCE IS OVER.
 IT'S BAD.
 I THINK ON THE BIGGER QUESTION
 ON WHETHER HE PERJURED HIMSELF,
 I AGREE WITH YOU, THAT UNLESS
 TRUMP'S GOING TO GO UP TO
 CONGRESS, WHICH HE'S NOT GOING
 TO DO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW.
 IT'S HIM AGAINST HIM.
 MANY PEOPLE ARE WONDERING
 WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP'S
 STATEMENTS AND SOME OF HIS
 TWEETS COULD BE CONSIDERED
 WITNESS TAMPERING BECAUSE
 MICHAEL COHEN IS STILL
 COOPERATING WITH MANY
 INVESTIGATIONS RIGHT NOW.
 HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF THAT
 BEFORE.
 A LOT OF HIS TWEETS WERE VERY
 THREATENING.
 HE THREATENED MICHAEL COHEN'S
 FATHER-IN-LAW BEFORE THE FIRST
 TIME HE WAS GOING IN TO TESTIFY.
 THE BIGGER ISSUE IS THE
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE QUESTION
 BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING -WE'RE SO
 FOCUSED ON THE PERJURY.
 WHAT WAS THE UNDERLYING ISSUE?
 IT WAS THE DANGLING OF A
 POTENTIAL PARDON, WHETHER HE DID
 IT OR DIDN'T.
 THIS IS A BIGGER QUESTION THAT
 GOES TO MANAFORT, FLYNN.
 EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE
 DEFENDANTS AND WE KNOW FROM BILL
 BARR'S TESTIMONY THAT HE
 BELIEVES THAT A DANGLE OF A
 PARDON COULD POTENTIALLY BE
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS
 ODD THAT HE WOULD BELIEVE THAT
 BECAUSE HE ALSO WROTE THAT MEMO
 SAYING THAT HE BELIEVED THAT
 FIRING JOHN McCAIN COULDN'T BE
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME AT THIS
 POINT OF WHAT DOES AND DOESN'T
 QUALIFY.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PICKING
 UP ON JUST THE FIRST FEW
 PARAGRAPHS THERE BY BILL BARR
 MORE THAN A YEAR AGO.
 I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS NOW.
 I SAW THE HEADLINE JUST A COUPLE
 DAYS AGO.
 MICHAEL COHEN IS SUING THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION FOR NEARLY
 $2 MILLION.
 LAWSUIT THERE READING IN PART,
 QUOTE, MR. COHEN HAS BEEN
 ORDERED TO PAY OR FORFEIT
 APPROXIMATELY $1.9 MILLION AS
 PART OF HIS CRIMINAL SENTENCE
 ARISING FROM CONDUCT UNDERTAKEN
 BY MR. COHEN IN FURTHERANCE OF
 AND AT THE BEHEFT OF THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION AND ITS PRINCIPLES,
 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.
 INTERESTING OPTICS HERE.
 TWO THOUGHTS, ONE YOU CANNOT
 MAKE THIS UP.
 I CONTINUE TO FEEL LIKE I'M IN
 BIZARRO LAND THAT WE'RE HAVING
 THIS OPEN CONVERSATION ABOUT A
 SITTING PRESIDENT AND ALL THESE
 ALLEGED ACTS OF CRIMINAL
 INFLUENCE, TAMPERING.
 MICHAEL COHEN WANTED LAWYER FEES
 FROM TRUMP FOR A WHILE.
 HE ASKED FOR THEM LIKE RIGHT
 AROUND THE TIME OF THE RAID IF
 I'M CORRECT AND I'M NOT
 SURPRISED ABOUT THIS AT ALL
 BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE I DID
 THESE THINGS ON BEHALF OF,
 THEREFORE, I'M IN TROUBLE
 BECAUSE OF YOU AND HE ALSO
 IDENTIFIED THE PRESIDENT AS
 INDIVIDUAL NUMBER ONE.
 HE SAID THAT IN HIS TESTIMONY.
 WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT
 THAT A WHOLE LOT.
 WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THAT.
 I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT HE'S
 ASKING FOR THE FEES.
 HE'S NOT GOING TO GET THEM,
 PROBABLY, BUT HE'S ASKING.
 SDNY IS LOOKING INTO
 INDIVIDUAL NUMBER ONE QUITE A
 BIT THERE.
 YES.
 THIS IS A REALLY BUSY MONTH.
 HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE HOUSE
 JANS COMMITTEE IS NOW POSTPONED
 UNTIL MARCH 27th.
 YOU SEE THERE.
 WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO HEAR
 FROM HIM?
 THIS GUY HAS BEEN ON THE
 PERIPHERY THIS WHOLE TIME
 LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND AND HE
 REALLY CAME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT
 DURING MICHAEL COHEN'S TESTIMONY
 WHICH HE JUST GAVE.
 MICHAEL COHEN STATED THAT FELIX
 SEDER NOT ONLY DID EVAN OFFICE
 AT THE TRUMP OFFICE BUT IT WAS
 ON DONALD TRUMP'S FLOOR.
 THE ISSUE IS HOW INVOLVED IS HE
 IN THE TRUMP TOWER/MOSCOW
 PROJECT, IS HE GOING TO GIVE
 ANSWERS IN TERMS OF WHEN THAT
 WENT INTO THE TIME.
 SOMETHING INTERESTING
 HAPPENED OVERNIGHT THAT I WANT
 TO GET YOUR TAKE ON, GUYS.
 IT WAS AMAZING BACK AND FORTH
 THAT TOOK PLACE ON TELEVISION ON
 AL JAZEERA INVOLVING ONE OF THE
 DOZENS OF FIGURES THAT ARE
 INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE RUSSIA
 INVESTIGATION AND SPEAKING HERE
 OF ERIC PRINCE.
 HE IS THE FOUNDER AS YOU ALL
 KNOW OF THE CONTROVERSIAL GROUP
 THAT IS CALLED BLACK WATER.
 HE'S THE BROTHER OF THE
 EDUCATION SECRETARY.
 SO PRINCE WAS THERE FOR THE
 FIRST TIME, IT APPEARS THAT HE
 WAS CONFIRMING A "NEW YORK
 TIMES" REPORT THAT HE ARRANGED
 AN AUGUST 2016 TRUMP TOWER
 MEETING BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP JR.
 AND MIDDLE EASTERNERS LOOKING TO
 HELP TRUMP.
 I MIGHT HAVE BEEN -I THINK
 I WAS AT TRUMP HEADQUARTERS OR
 THE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS --
 TRUMP TOWER, 2016, YOU AND
 ISRAELI DO, DON JUNIOR, STEPHEN
 MILLER.
 WERE THERE TO TALK ABOUT IRAN
 POLICY.
 DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD
 HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE?
 I DID.
 YOU DIDN'T.
 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY GOT THE
 TRANSCRIPT WRONG.
 I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ANYBODY IN
 MORE THAN NINE MONTHS.
 YOU SAY WOW.
 I KEEP SAYING YOU CAN'T MAKE
 IT UP.
 I'M IN AWE.
 I'M SIMPLY IN AWE AND NOT A GOOD
 WAY.
 HE DOESN'T KNOW IF THEY GOT
 THE TRANSCRIPT WRONG.
 COULD HE BE IN SOME SORT OF
 JEOPARDY RIGHT THERE.
 THERE'S A WORD FOR WHAT HE IS
 RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S TARGET.
 I WATCHED THAT INTERVIEW AND
 WHEN HE HAS NOTHING LEFT TO FALL
 BACK ON, OTHER THAN MAYBE THEY
 GOT THE TRANSCRIPT OF MY SWORN
 TESTIMONY WRONG, ON THIS BIG
 TICKET ISSUE AND THEN HE ADDED,
 I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM MUELLER IN
 NINE MONTHS OR ANYBODY, WELL,
 THAT'S BECAUSE, SPORT, YOU'VE
 RIPENED INTO A TARGET BECAUSE
 YOU APPARENTLY TESTIFIED FALSELY
 ON A MATERIAL MATTER, AN
 IMPORTANT MATTER TO THE
 CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY.
 I SUSPECT WE'LL SEE HIM INDICTED
 IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE.
 I IMAGINE HIS PUBLICISTS WERE
 AS UPSET AS R. KELLY'S.
 ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
 THAT?
 THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME ON
 THE 24 HOUR NETWORK.
 SO STILL AHEAD, THE
 ANTICIPATION IS MOUNTING FOR THE
 END OF ROBERT MUELLER'S
 INVESTIGATION, BUT DON'T GO
 REACHING FOR THE POPCORN YET.
 HOW DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING THE
 PRESSURE ON THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE THE ENTIRE
 REPORT?
 I AM JOINED LIVE ABOUT
 CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON LEE
 TO TALK ALL ABOUT.
 WE ARE CELEBRATING WOMEN
 HISTORY MONTH.
 THIS MARCH AND THIS WEEK, WE'RE
 PROFILING A DEAL MAKING HER
 STORY SOME OF THE
 CONGRESSWOMAN'S COLLEAGUES.
 DEMOCRATS SHARICE DAVIS AND DEB
 HELEN ARE THE FIRST NATIVE
 AMERICAN WOMEN RECENTLY ELECTED
 TO CONGRESS.
 SHE WON KANSAS'S THIRD DISTRICT
 SEAT AND HOLLAND WAS ELECTED
 NEW MEXICO'S FIRST DISTRICT
 SEAT.
 CONGRATULATIONS, LADIES.
    I'M REALLY INTO THIS CAR,
     BUT HOW DO I KNOW IF     I'M GETTING A GOOD DEAL?
      I TELL TRUECAR MY ZIP
       AND WHICH CAR I WANT
       AND TRUECAR SHOWS       THE RANGE OF PRICES
  PEOPLE IN MY AREA  ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SAME CAR
     SO I KNOW IF I'M GETTING     A GREAT PRICE.
     THIS IS HOW CAR BUYING     WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE.
         THIS IS TRUECAR.
 ANY DAY NOW WE EXPECT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO DELIVER HIS
 REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,
 BUT WILL IT BE A DROP THE MIC
 MOMENT?
 THE PUBLIC MAY ONLY GET A SHORT
 SUMMARY OF THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 MANY DEMOCRATS NOW CONTROL THE
 HOUSE AND THEY SAY THEY WILL
 DEMAND MUELLER'S FULL REPORT AS
 WELL AS THE EVIDENCE BEHIND ALL
 OF IT.
 JOINING ME NOW IS ONE PARTICULAR
 DEMOCRAT WHO IS ASKING FOR THE
 FULL REPORT, TEXAS DEMOCRATIC
 REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON
 LEE WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
 CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
 FOR BEING HERE.
 SO YOU JUST GET A SHORTENED
 VERSION OF THE REPORT, WHAT'S
 YOUR REACTION GOING TO BE?
 KENDIS, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A
 DELIGHT TO BE HERE WITH YOU AND
 LET ME FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE AND
 EXPRESS MY CONCERN AND SYMPATHY
 FOR THE VICTIMS IN ALABAMA AND
 THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES THEY'VE
 HAD AND THE COMMITMENT BY THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THEM
 WHOLE.
 I ABSOLUTELY EXPECT, KENDIS, NOT
 TO GET A SUMMARY AND I WILL TURN
 ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR'S WORDS
 BACK ON HIM WHEN HE WAS PRESSED
 BY THE SENATE DURING HIS
 CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, HE MADE A
 COMMITMENT THAT THE PUBLIC
 DESERVED TO HEAR THE RESULTS OF
 THE MUELLER REPORT IN FULL.
 I WILL ADD THE TERM, IN FULL,
 BUT THE RESULTS MEANS THAT YOU
 HAVE TO SEE THE REPORT IN FULL
 AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THE DOJ
 POLICY OF THE LAST TWO YEARS
 INDICATED THAT THE PUBLIC CAN
 SEE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS IF IT
 IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
 WHAT REPORT COULD BE MORE IN THE
 PUBLIC INTEREST THAN THE MUELLER
 REPORT?
 THE VERY REPORT THAT WAS
 DESIGNATED RIGHT AFTER THE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 FIRED THE FBI DIRECTOR UNDER A
 SPECULATION AND POTENTIAL CHARGE
 OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, UNDER
 THE ACTUAL WORDS OF THE
 PRESIDENT WHO SAID SUBSEQUENT TO
 THAT FIRING THAT IT WAS ABOUT
 THE RUSSIAN THING, OR SINCE THAT
 TIME WE HAVE HEARD FROM ROGER
 STONE WHO INDICATED OR COHEN WHO
 INDICATED THAT HE WAS IN A
 MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
 WHEN ROGER STONE CALLED ON THE
 PHONE AND INDICATED THAT THERE
 WOULD BE A DUMP OF WIKILEAKS --
 WOULD BE DUMPING THE EMAILS OF
 SENATOR CLINTON, SECRETARY
 CLINTON, AT THAT TIME, TO RUIN
 HER CAMPAIGN.
 THERE JUST CANNOT BE ANY EXCUSE
 FOR NOT PRESENTING TO THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE
 FULL REPORT AS OPPOSED TO CLIFF
 NOTES VERSION.
 MY COLLEAGUE ARI MELBER SPOKE
 WITH THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 CHAIRMAN, YOUR COLLEAGUE, JERRY
 NADLER ABOUT THE EXPANSIVE
 DOCUMENTS THE COMMITTEE HAS
 REQUESTED FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS DISMISSED.
 COULD THERE BE MORE REQUESTS TO
 COME?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 KENDIS, MIGHT I SAY A POINT MORE
 AS I SAY IN RESPOND TO THE
 QUESTION OF EXPANDING THE LIST
 OF INDIVIDUALS, I THINK IT IS
 IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE
 RESPECTFUL OF THE RULE OF LAW
 AND WHERE THERE ARE THIRD
 PARTIES THAT ABSOLUTELY ARE NOT
 INVOLVED, THOSE NAMES CAN BE
 REDACTED.
 THIS IS OUT OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT, BUT ORDINARILY, EVEN
 THIRD PARTIES' NAMES CAN BE
 INDICATED AS LONG AS THERE'S
 SOME CLARIFICATION THAT THEY'RE
 NOT UNDER ANY REVIEW OR
 INDICTMENT OR THEY'RE NOT
 TARGETS.
 REALLY QUICKLY, I'M UNDER THE
 CRUNCH, OUT OF THE 81 TARGETS ON
 THE DOCUMENT REQUEST ITSELF,
 IVANKA TRUMP IS NOT INCLUDED.
 SHOULD SHE BE AND WILL HER NAME
 BE?
 HERE'S THE POINT I THINK WE
 WANT TO BE CAREFUL.
 WE WANT TO BE DELIBERATE AND
 THERE'S GOING TO BE A SECOND
 CRUNCH OF NAMES AND I WOULD
 THINK THAT, ONE, THERE'S NO
 DOUBT THAT ONE WANTS TO BE
 SENSITIVE ABOUT CHILDREN,
 GRANDCHILDREN, FAMILY MEMBERS,
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT THE
 TRUTH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 AS YOU WELL KNOW, ERIC TRUMP IS
 ON THE DONALD TRUMP TRUST IS ON,
 DONALD TRUMP JR. IS ON.
 IT'LL BE A QUESTION OF, AS WE
 LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS, WHO ELSE
 NEEDS TO BE ON, NOT FOR THE
 NECESSITY OF SAYING WRONG HAS
 BEEN DONE, BUT TO GET
 INFORMATION REGARDING PUBLIC
 CORRUPTION, ABUSE AND
 OBSTRUCTION OF THE LAWS.
 AND SO THE CLEAR BASIS OF TRYING
 TO GET THESE DOCUMENTS IS NOT
 HARASSMENT, IT IS CLEARLY WITHIN
 THE ARTICLE 1 RESPONSIBILITIES
 OF THE CONGRESS AND CERTAINLY IN
 THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE
 HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, BE
 REMINDED THAT FOR THE TWO/THREE
 YEARS THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN
 UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE
 REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND SENATE,
 THERE'S BEEN NO ACCOUNTABILITY
 AND NOW THE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE'S DOING NOTHING MORE
 THAN IT'S JOB AND THAT IS TO
 HOLD INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR
 ACTS OF CORRUPTION, ABUSE AND
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 AND INDEED HIGHLIGHTING THE
 POINT THAT ELECTIONS HAVE
 CONSEQUENCES, INDEED.
 REPRESENTATIVE, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH FOR BEING HERE ON A
 SATURDAY.
 THANK YOU.
 A SILICON VALLEY BREAK-UP.
 WHY ELIZABETH WARREN IS GOING
 AFTER BIG TECH COMPANIES LIKE
 FACEBOOK, AMAZON AND GOOGLE?
       <i> You wouldn't accept</i>       <i> an incomplete job</i>
       <i> from any one else.</i>
       <i> Why accept it from</i>       <i> your allergy pills?</i>
   <i> Flonase Sensimist relieves</i>   <i> all your worst symptoms,</i>
   <i> including nasal congestion,</i>
     <i> which most pills don't.</i>
   <i> And all from a gentle mist</i>
      <i> you can barely feel.</i>
      <i> Flonase Sensimist.</i>
 AMAZON? TOO BIG.
 GOOGLE?
 TOO BIG.
 FACEBOOK?
 TOO BIG.
 MARK ZUCKERBERG?
 TOO POWERFUL.
 HUM.
 AND THAT'S REALLY THE POINT
 OF THE TOO BIGS.
 IT'S THEY'VE GOT TOO MUCH POWER.
 VERY INTERESTING THERE.
 ELIZABETH WARREN WITH MY
 COLLEAGUE JUST LAST NIGHT ON THE
 BEAT AND NOW SHE'S ABOUT TO TAKE
 ON ALL THOSE BIG TECH GIANTS ON
 THEIR HOME TURF.
 THE SENATOR'S EXPECTED TO TAKE
 THE STAGE IN TEN MINUTES FROM
 NOW AT THE SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST
 CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN.
 IT IS A MECCA FOR CUTTING EDGE
 TECH AND NEW MEDIA.
 SO WHILE THE ELIZABETH WARREN IS
 EXPECTED TO CONTINUE HER PUSH
 FOR MORE REGULATION OF TECH
 GIANTS, COMPANIES LIKE FACEBOOK
 ARE IMPOSING SOME NEW
 RESTRICTIONS OF THEIR OWN.
 BUSINESS REPORTER BRANDY JOINS
 US RIGHT NOW FROM SOUTH BY
 SOUTHWEST IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, AND
 BRANDI, SENATOR WARREN'S
 COMMENTS, HOW ARE THEY BEING
 RECEIVED RIGHT NOW AT THIS BIG
 TECH FOCUSED FESTIVAL?
 Reporter: PEOPLE ARE
 OBVIOUSLY BUZZING ABOUT IT.
 THIS IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE
 THING WE'VE HEARD, THE MOST
 AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO BREAK UP THE
 BIG TECH COMPANIES.
 THIS PLACE IS FULL.
 EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT.
 WHO'S NOT TALKING ABOUT IT ARE
 THE BIG TECH COMPANIES.
 NO ONE'S RELEASED A STATEMENT.
 EVERYONE'S WAITING TO HEAR WHAT
 THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT AND
 WHAT THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC
 CHALLENGERS WILL SAY AS WELL.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, THIS, OF
 COURSE, IS WHERE TWITTER
 STARTED.
 IT IS WHERE, I BELIEVE, FOUR
 SQUARE STARTED, SO WHILE IT MAY
 HAVE STARTED 30 YEARS AGO AS BIG
 MUSIC FESTIVAL, GIVE ME A SENSE
 AND GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE OF THE
 IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SO
 MANY OF THESE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES
 THERE.
 Reporter: THIS IS WHERE
 EVERYONE COMES TO TALK ABOUT THE
 FUTURE OF TECH, SO YOU HAVE, YOU
 KNOW, TINY TECH COMPANIES AND
 THEN YOU HAVE THE BIG GUYS AND
 THEY'RE ALL SORT OF TOGETHER.
 THE PROBLEM IS IN WHAT ELIZABETH
 WARREN IS SORT OF TRYING TO
 COMBAT WITH THIS PLAN IS THE
 LITTLE GUYS DON'T NECESSARILY
 STAND A CHANCE ANY MORE WITHOUT
 BEING SCOOPED UP BY THE BIG
 COMPANIES.
 IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT,
 WHATEVER HAPPENS WITH THIS
 THAT --
 DO WE HAVE ANY EXPECTATION ON
 WHAT SHE'LL SAY IN JUST A FEW
 MINUTES FROM NOW?
 Reporter: I THINK SHE'LL SAY
 THE SAME THING SHE SAID IN LONG
 ISLAND CITY.
 SHE'S LAYING OUT HER PLAN SEEING
 IF PEOPLE IN LONG ISLAND CITY
 WERE RECEPTIVE TO IT.
 THEY WERE THE HOME THAT AMAZON
 DECIDED NOT TO GO TO, BUT HERE
 WHERE IT'S EVERY BIG TECH
 COMPANY AGAIN IS HERE AND THE
 REPRESENTATIVES ARE HERE, I'M
 CURIOUS TO SEE HOW IT'S GOING TO
 BE RECEIVED.
 ALL RIGHT.
 BRANDY THERE IN AUSTIN.
 THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF
 ENTHUSIASM AS PEOPLE ARE QUITE
 LOUD THERE.
 BRANDY, THANK YOU.
 MANY OF MY NBC NEWS
 COLLEAGUES WILL BE THERE THIS
 WEEKEND.

 INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING, THE
 SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS ONLINE AS
 WELL AS SELF-DRIVING CARS.

 TO SEE THEM, FOLLOW NBC NEWS ON
 TWITTER.
 THE WHITE HOUSE SAID, NO WAY
 TO DEMOCRATS, BUT NOW THE HOUSE
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORTEDLY
 HAS DOCUMENTS REVEALING JUST HOW
 JARED AND IVANKA GOT THEIR
 SECURITY CLEARANCES.
 DID THE PRESIDENT ABUSE HIS
 POWER TO GET THEM TOP SECURITY
 ACCESS?
    If you have postmenopausal    osteoporosis
   and a high risk for fracture
  now might not be the best time  to ask yourself
       are my bones strong?
  Life is full of make-or-break  moments.
   That's why it's so important
   to help reduce your risk of   fracture with Prolia®.
  Only Prolia® is proven to help  strengthen
 and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months.
 Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant,
   are allergic to it, or take   XGEVA®.
   Serious allergic reactions,
 like low blood pressure; trouble breathing;
 throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling;
   rash; itching; or hives have   happened.
  Tell your doctor about dental  problems
 as severe jaw bone problems may happen
  or new or unusual pain in your  hip groin, or thigh,
 as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred.
   Speak to your doctor before   stopping Prolia®
     as spine and other bone     fractures have occurred.
  Prolia® can cause serious side  effects,
 like low blood calcium, serious infections,
 which could need hospitalization, skin problems,
    and severe bone, joint, or    muscle pain.
          Are you ready?
 Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones.
