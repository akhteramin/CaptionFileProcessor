Speak to your doctor before stopping Prolia® as spine and other bone fractures have occurred.

Because we believe all men deserve a razor just for them. The best a man can get. Gillette. I've always been amazed by what's next. And still going for my best, even though I live with a higher risk of stroke due to Afib not caused by a heart valve problem. So if there's a better treatment than warfarin... I want that too. ELIQUIS. ELIQUIS is proven to reduce stroke risk better than warfarin. Plus has significantly less major bleeding than warfarin. ELIQUIS is FDA-approved and has both. What's next? Reeling in a nice one. <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i> <i>as stopping increases your risk</i> <i> of having a stroke.</i> <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i> <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i> <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i> <i> an artificial heart valve</i> <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i> <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i> <i> you may bruise more easily</i> <i> and it may take longer than</i> <i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i> <i> Seek immediate medical care</i> <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i> <i> like unusual bruising.</i> <i> ELIQUIS may increase your</i> <i> bleeding risk</i> <i> if you take certain medicines.</i> <i> Tell your doctor</i> <i> about all planned medical</i> <i> or dental procedures.</i> ELIQUIS, the number one cardiologist-prescribed blood thinner.

If you have postmenopausal osteoporosis and a high risk for fracture now might not be the best time to ask yourself are my bones strong? Life is full of make-or-break moments. That's why it's so important to help reduce your risk of fracture with Prolia®. Only Prolia® is proven to help strengthen and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months. Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant, are allergic to it, or take XGEVA®. Serious allergic reactions, like low blood pressure; trouble breathing; throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling; rash; itching; or hives have happened. Tell your doctor about dental problems as severe jaw bone problems may happen or new or unusual pain in your hip groin, or thigh, as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred. Speak to your doctor before stopping Prolia® as spine and other bone fractures have occurred. Prolia® can cause serious side effects, like low blood calcium, serious infections, which could need hospitalization, skin problems, and severe bone, joint, or muscle pain. Are you ready? Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones. Audible members know listening has the power to change us make us better parents, better leaders, better people.
