 I'M WOLF BLITZER.
 YOU'RE IN "THE SITUATION ROOM".■
 THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS.
 ROOER FOLLOWING BREAKING
 NEWS.
 RIGHT NOW HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE
 HOLDING AN URGENT CONFERENCE
 CALL TO DISCUSS THEIR STRATEGY
 FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 PART OF THAT STRATEGY INCLUDES
 THE POSSIBILITY OF KBEECHING
 PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE OF WHAT
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL REVEALED
 ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S REPEATED
 ATTEMPTS TO INTERVIEW WITH AND
 SHUT DOWN THE INVESTIGATION.
 THE PRESIDENT INSISTS HE ISN'T
 WORRIED ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.
 HE ALSO IS SUING CONGRESS RIGHT
 NOW, CONTENDING LAWMAKERS DON'T
 HAVE A RIGHT TO LOOK INTO HIS
 FINAN
 FINANCIAL DEALINGS.
 THE U.S. SENATE HAS THE FINAL
 SAY ON IMPEACHMENT.
 I'LL SPEAK WITH DEMOCRATIC
 SENATOR, JACK REED, AND I'LL GET
 TO THAT MOMENTARILY.
 AND OUR CORRESPONDENTS AND
 ANALYSTS, THEY WILL HAVE FULL
 COVERAGE OF THE DAY'S TOP
 STORIES.
 FIRST, THE POLITICS OF
 IMPEACHMENT.
 OUR SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL
 CORRESPONDENT, MANU RAJU, IS UP
 ON CAPITOL HILL, KEEPING TABS ON
 SOURCES LISTENING IN ON THE
 DEMOCRATS' CONFERENCE CALL.
 MANU, I ALSO UNDERSTAND, YOU
 HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS.
 Reporter: YEAH, BREAKING NEWS
 INDEED, WOLF.
 THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS
 SUBPOENAING THE FORMER WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL, DON McGAHN,
 ASKING HIM FOR HIS TESTIMONY AND
 FOR RECORDS, IN RELATION TO THE
 COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION INTO
 POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE.
 THIS, ACCORDING TO A PERSON
 FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER, WHO
 TELLS ME THAT THE COMMITTEE IS,
 INDEED, MOVING FORWARD WITH A
 SUBPOENA FOR DON McGAHN.
 RECALL THAT RECENTLY, THE
 COMMITTEE WASZED TO
 ISSUE SUBPOENAS FOR FIVE
 DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.
 FIVE FORMER WHITE HOUSE
 OFFICIALS, PEOPLE WHO HAD
 COOPERATED WITH THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION.
 WELL, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE
 RELEASE OF THE REDACTED VERSION
 OF THE MUELLER REPORT, THE
 COMMITTEE IS MAKING ITS NEXT
 MOVE, ISSUING A SUBPOENA FOR DON
 McGAHN, ASKING FOR HIS
 TESTIMONY, PROBABLY IN PUBLIC.
 ALSO, ASKING FOR RECORDS,
 ANYTHING THAT HE GOT AS HE
 PREPARED TO TESTIFY.
 AND AS YOU KNOW, WOLF, McGAN WAS
 A CENTRAL PLAYER FOR THE --
 DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND HIS
 NAME IS MENTIONED THROUGHOUT
 ROBERT MUELLER'S REPORT, IN
 ADDITION NO WHAT HE'S REFERENCED
 IN THE REPORT, TO THE
 PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS TO
 APPARENTLY TRY AND DISMISS
 ROBERT MUELLER.
 HE WAS ASKED TO DISMISS ROBERT
 MUELLER, BUT McGAN, ACCORDING TO
 THE REPORT, RESISTED THAT MOVE.
 AND SAID THAT HE WOULD RATHER
 RESIGN THAN TRIGGER WHAT HE
 REGARDED AS A POTENTIAL SATURDAY
 NIGHT MASSACRE.
 THAT'S HOW THE MUELLER REPORT
 QUOTES DON McGAHN'S VIEWS IN
 RESISTING THE CALL TO FIRE THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL.
 BUT NEVERTHELESS, A SIGNIFICANT
 MOVE HERE BY THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE, TAKING STEPS TO
 SUBPOENA THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL, DON McGAHN, AND EXPECT
 THAT TO HAPPEN POTENTIAL SOON.
 WE'LL SEE THE EXACT DATE, WHEN
 THEY EXPECT THEM TO COME
 FORWARD.
 BUT THE MOMENT, JERRY NADLER
 TELLING HIS COLLEAGUES ON THIS
 CONFERENCE CALL THAT THAT'S WHAT
 HE PLANS TO DO WITH HIS
 COMMITTEE, AS THE DEMOCRATIC
 LEADERSHIP TRIES TO MOVE FORWARD
 ON THE INVESTIGATIVE FRONT AND
 TRIES TO TAMP DOWN CALLS FOR
 IMPEACHMENT, SAYING THEY CAN
 JUST AS MUCH INFORMATION BY
 INTERVIEWING PEOPLE LIKE DON
 McGAHN AND NOT NECESSARILY GOING
 THE ROUTE OF IMPEACHMENT, AT
 LEAST NOT YET.
 BUT NEVERTHELESS, IT COULD BE A
 VERY DRAMATIC MOMENT IF DON
 McGAHN COMES TO CONGRESS AND
 TELLS HIS WOLF.
 HE SPENT 30 YOURS<RI
 QUESTIONS FROM THE Mx
 WHY DID÷ THEY NEED TO IMPEACHO N
 McG
 WHY WOULDN'T HE JUST COME
 VOLUNTARILY?
 IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
 WE'VE KNOWN THAT THEY'VE HAD
 INTERACTIONS WITH DON McGAHN'S
 ATTORNEY SINCE MARCH.
 THE ATTORNEY HAS SENT LETTERS TO
 81 INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES WHO
 THEY WANT TO DISCUSS AS PART OF
 THE DEMOCRATS' INVESTIGATION
 INTO POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE, POTENTIAL ABUSES IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 DON McGAHN WAS ONE OF THOSE
 INDIVIDUALS.
 NOW, IT'S NOT CLEAR IF HE HAS
 FULLY COMPLIED WITH THE REQUEST.
 WE KNOW THAT FORMER WHITE HOUSE
 OFFICIALS HAVE DEFERRED TO THE
 WHITE HOUSE AND SAY, YOU NEED TO
 GO THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE TO
 DETERMINE WHAT CONSTITUTES
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND WHAT
 DOES NOT.
 SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT
 HE HAS PROVIDED THE SAME
 INFORMATION TO CAPITOL HILL THAT
 HE HAS PROVIDED TO THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL AND THE DEMOCRATS
 BELIEVE THAT, ESSENTIALLY,
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE RIGHTS ARE
 WAIVED BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT
 DOCUMENTS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN
 THE WHITE HOUSE AND DON McGAHN'S
 ATTORNEYS AND THE WAY HE
 PREPARED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL.
 THEY'LL TRY TO PURSUE IT ON
 THOSE GROUNDS.
 WE'LL SEE IF DON McGAHN COMPLIES
 COMPLETELY.
 PERHAPS THEY'LL DROP THEIR
 SUBPOENA IF THERE'S A VOLUNTARY
 AGREEMENT.
 BUT AT THE MOMENT, THAT'S A
 PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MOVE TO TRY
 TO COMPEL DON McGAHN'S TESTIMONY
 AND RYE TO GET HIM TO PROVIDE
 RECORDS PART OF THIS
 CREDIBILITY WHEN HE WASxTICE,
 ANSWERING Qxxxxxx xx
 MUELLER TEAMS I , 30 HOURS, HE
 SPENT■■■ HE ALSO TO PROVIDE
 DO TO THE xE?
 AND ARE THERE DATES WHEN THEY
 WANT HIM TO APPEAR?
 YEAH, WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT
 DOCUMENTS BY MAY 7th, TESTIMONY
 BY MAY 21st.
 SO THAT IS JUST A FEW WEEKS
 AWAY, WOLF.
 SO MAY COULD BE SET UP FOR A
 VERY SIGNIFICANT MONTH FOR THIS
 COMMITTEE.
 BECAUSE MAY 2nd IS WHEN BILL
 BARR IS EXPECTED TO COME IN A
 PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE THE HOUSE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
 THAT SAME MONTH, JERRY NADLER
 WANTS TO BRING IN THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL TO TESTIFY, AS WELL.
 THERE'S NO DATE SET YET FOR THE
 MUELLER HEARING, BUT MAY 7th IS
 WHEN HE WANTS DOC
 OVER
 MA 21 I WHEN HE WANTS THAT
 McGAHN TESTIMONY.
 SO SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS
 COULD HAPPEN.
 WE'LL SEE WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY
 LEARN.
 BUT A SIGN THAT THE DEMOCRATS
 AGAIN WANT TO GO DOWN THIS ROUTE
 OF INVESTIGATING AND LOOKING
 FURTHER INTO WHAT EXACTLY THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL FOUND, NOT
 NECESSARILY GOING DOWN THE ROUTE
 OF DEBATING ARTICLES OF
 IMPEACHMENT AND TRYING TO REMOVE
 THE PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE, BUT
 CONTINUE ON THIS FRONT.
 WE'LL SEE IF McGAHN PROVIDES THE
 DEMOCRATS WITH WHAT THEY'RE
 ASKING FOR HERE, WOLF.
 I THINK THEY WANT MUELLER TO
 TESTIFY BY MAY 23rd, AROUND THAT
 TIME, AS WELL.
 BY THE END OF THIS MONTH.
 THE ISSUE OF IMPEACHMENT SEEMS
 TO HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 PRETTY DEEPLY DIVIDED RIGHT NOW.
 I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE DISCUSSING
 THAT RIGHT NOW IN THIS HOUSE
 DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE CALL.
 WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?
 YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
 NANCY PELOSI HAS MADE IT PRETTY
 CLEAR THAT SHE IS NOT EAGER TO
 GO THIS ROUTE ON IMPEACHMENT.
 EVEN AS CALLS ON THE LEFT ARE
 GROWING LOUDER TO IMPEACH, SHE
 SAYS THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO
 LEARN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
 AND S■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■       O
 HER COLLEAGUES              ■■■G
 THE PRESIDE■■■■■■■■■ ■■ ■■■■ ■■■
 GAINED■■■ ■■■■■■■UTSIDE■■■■■■■■
 NEEDED REFORMS■■■■■■■■■■CT OUR
 DEMOCRACY, WE MUST SHOW THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
 PRESENTATION OF FACT.
 AND THAT LINE RIGHT THERE, THAT
 THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT THESE FACTS
 OUTSIDE OF IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS, A REAL SIGN OF WHAT
 HER PREFERENCE IS.
 SO THE QUESTION ON THIS CALL
 RIGHT NOW, WOLF, IS HOW MANY OF
 HER COLLEAGUES AGREE.
 I'M WILLING TO BET THAT MOST A
 LOT OF THEM DO, BUT THERE WILL
 STILL BE CALLS TO URGE THEIR
 CAUCUS TO TAKE A DIFFERENT
 APPROACH, BUT SHE AT THE MOMENT
 IS SAYING, LET'S SLOW DOWN, TALK
 ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, AND STILL DO
 THINGS LIKE WHAT JERRY NADLER IS
 DOING, LIKE ISSUING A SUBPOENA
 FOR THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL AND GET HIS TESTIMONY AS
 THEY PURSUE THEIR NEXT STEPS,
 WOLF.
 THESE AREx]x]x]x]x]x]x]x]x]x
 DEVELOPMENTS UNFOLDI■
 MANU,OU V■
 LET'S GO TO OUR CHIEF WHITE
 HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, JIM ACOSTA.
 JIM, THE PRESIDENT WON'T BE
 TESTIFYI ASSUMING HE DOES.
 eporter: THAT'S RIGH WOLF.
 AND KEEP IN MIND, DON McGAHN THE
 THE FORMER SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
 OFFICI WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL WHO WAS TOLD BY THE
 PRESIDENT TO FIRE THE2ELLER.
 McGAORDING TO THE MUELLER
 REEFUSED TO DO THAT, AS  WAS SA
 TRIGGER A SATURDAY NIGHT
 MASSACRE.
 AND THAT IS GOING TO BE SOME
 PRETTY FASCINATING TELEVISION TO
 WATCH, IF THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL TESTIFIES UP ON CAPITOL
 HILL IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
 THAT■C WITH THE
 PRESIDENT, IT IS GOING TO BE
 SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE
 COUNTRY IS GOING TO WANT TO
 WATCH.
 MEANWHILE, THE PRESIDENT, WE
 SHOULD SAY, HAS BEEN TRYING TO
 CONVINCE THE PUBLIC ALL DAY LONG
 TO BELIEVE HIM AND NOT THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 THE PRESIDENT INSISTED TODAY
 THAT HIS AIDES ALWAYS OBEY HIS
 ORDERS, DESPITE WHAT THE MUELLER
 REPORT SAYS ABOUT THAT
 INTERACTION WITH DON McGAHN AND
 OTHER INTERACT.
 JUST TODAY, I WAS TOLD BY A
 FORMER WSE OFFICIAL THAT
 THERE WEREICIALS LIKE DON
 McGAHN WHO■C■C REFUSED TO CARRY
 THE PRESIDENT'S ORDERS.
 AND THE PRESIDENT ALSO CLAIMING
 HE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT TONIGHT,
 HE TWEETED ABOUT THAT PROSPECT
 EARLIER TODAY.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
 EVERYBODY.
 HAPPY EASTER.
 Reporter: AT THE WHITE HOUSE
 EASTER EGG ROLL, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 TOLD CNN HIS ORDERS ARE ALWAYS
 FOLLOWED.
 ARE YOU WORRIED THAT YOU
 STAFF IS IGNORING YOUR ORDERS AS
 THE MUELLER REPORT PORTRAYS?
 NOBODY DISOBEYS MY ORDERS.
 Reporter: BUT SPECIAL COUNSEL
 ROBERT MUELLER'S REPORT SAYS
 THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WROTE IN HIS
 REPORT, THE PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS
 TO INFLUENCE THE INVESTIGATION
 WERE MOSTLY UNSUCCESSFUL, BUT
 THAT IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE
 PERSONS WHO SURROUNDED THE
 PRESIDENT DECLINEDRY OUT
 ORDERS.
 DEMOCRATS WANT TO HEAR FROM
 FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON
 McGAHN, AFTER IT WAS STATED IN
 THE MUELLER REPORT THAT HE
 REFUSED TO REQUEST BY THE
 PRESIDENT TO FIRE THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL.
 WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS INSIST,
 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SUCH
 AN ORDER.
 IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO
 FIRE BOB MUELLER, HE WOULD HAVE.
 IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS THE
 AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.
 HE FIRED DIRECTOR COMEY.
 Reporter: THE PRESIDENT ALSO
 APPEARS TO BE LAYING OUT THE
 CASE AGAINST HIS OWN
 IMPEACHMENT, TWEETING, ONLY HIGH
 CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS CAN LEAD
 TO IMPEACHMENT.
 THERE WERE NO CRIMES BY ME, NO
 COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION, SO
 YOU CAN IMPEACH.
 IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS THAT■y
 COMMITTED THE CRIMES, YOUR
 REPUBLICooAT EASTER EGG ROLL, T
 PRESIDENT ALL BUT HOPPED AWAY
 FROM THE IMPEACHMENT QUESTION,
 TOARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT, PRESIDENT?
 NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.
 Repor PRESIDENT'S
 OUTSIDE ATTORNEY IS ALSO
 RESPONDING TO MUELLER'S
 FINDINGS, ARGUING ON CNN THAT IT
 WAS JUST FINE FOR THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN TO ACCEPT DIRT ON
 HILLARY CLINTON FROM RUSSIA.
 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
 TAKING INFORMATION FROM
 RUSSIANS!
 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
 TAKING INFORMATION --
 DEPENDS ON WHERE IT CAME
 FROM!
 Reporter: DEMOCRATS SAY,
 THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
 I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH MR.
 GIULIANI.
 THERE IS A LOT WRONG WITH TAKING
 INFORMATION FROM AN ADVERSARY, A
 FOREIGN ADVERSARY, FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENT.
 Reporter: ANOTHER MAJOR
 DEVELOPMENT IN THE
 INVESTIGATION, THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION IS NOW SUING HOUSE
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ELIJAH
 CUMMINGS TO BLOCK DEMOCRATS FROM
 OBTAINING THE PRESIDENT'S
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE
 LAST EIGHT YEARS, SAYING IN A
 STATEMENT, IT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED
 OVERREACH OF CONGRESSIONAL
 AUTHORITY.
 CUMMINGS FIRED BACK SAYING, THE
 PRESIDENT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF
 TRYING TO USE BASELESS LAWSUITS
 TO ATTACK HIS ADVERSARIES, BUT
 THERE IS SIMPLY NO VALID LEGAL
 BASIS.
 THE PRESIDENT WAS KEEPING BUSY
 ON TWITTER, ANNOUNCING FORMER
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, HERMAN
 CAIN, HAS DECIDED AGAINST
 SEEKING A SPOT ON THE FEDERAL
 RESERVE.
 BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS HAVING
 TROUBLE COMMUNICATING THE FACTS
 ON THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SRI
 LANKA.
 AT ONE POINT, TWEHAT 138#
 MILLION PEOPLE HAD ■
 MR. TRUMP ALSO TWEETED, HE HAD
 SPOKEN WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SRI
 LANKA.
 TURNS OUT IT WAS THATCOUNTRY'S
 PRIME MINISTER.
 AS FOR THE ■a■a■a■a ACTIONS
 LAID OUT IN THE MUELLER REPORT,
 A FORMER ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
 SAYS MR. TRUMP, QUOTE, COULD
 HAVE USED A LOT MORE FIRM LEGAL
 GUIDANCE EARLY ON IN HIS
 PRESIDENCY.
 AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT LATE IN
 THE DAY, THE PRESIDENT TWEETED
 AGAIN ABOUT THE MUELLER REPORT,
 SAYING STATING, ISN'T IT AMAZING
 THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSEST TO
 ME BY FAR AND KNEW THE CAMPAIGN
 BETTER THAN ANYONE WERE NEVER
 EVEN CALLED TO TESTIFY BEFORE
 MUELLER.
 IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO THE PRESIDENT
 IS REFERRING TO IN THAT TWEET,
 WOLF, BUT TOP AIDES TO THE EVEN
 SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER, WERE
 INTERVIEWED BY THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL.
 THE PRESID SEEM■ç
 AGAIN TWISTING THE TRUTH TO
 UNDERMINE THE MUELLER REPORT.
 WOLF?
 JIM ACOSTA AT THE WHITE HOUSE
 FOR US, THANK YOU.
 JOINING US NOW, SENATOR JACK
 REED OF RHODE ISLAND.
 HE'S THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE
 ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AND AS
 SUCH, IS AN EXMEMB OF THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THANK YOU
 SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
 THANK YOU, WOLF.
 WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS, BUT
 FIRST, YOUR REACTION TO THIS
 SUBPOENA TO HAVE DON McGAHN TO
 COME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND
 TESTIFY.
 WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?
 I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE.
 I THINK THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE IS THE FOCAL POINT,
 THE FOCUS OF INVESTIGATIONS OF
 THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT.
 MR. McGAN WAS THERE.
 HE IS FEATURES PROMINENTLY IN
 THE MUELLER REPORT.
 I THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
 FOR NOT ONLY THE CONGRESS, BUT
 FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR
 HIS POSITION ON WHAT HE SAID,
 IT'S BEING DISPUTED BY THE
 PRESIDENT.
 I TEND TO CONCUR WITH THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 I THINK DIRECTOR MUELLER DID A
 VERY FAIR, VERY HONEST, VERY
 PROFESSIONAL JOB.
 SOME ARE ALREADY EVEN MAKING
 COMPARISONS TO WATERGATE, WHEN
 THEN WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL JOHN
 DEAN WAS FORCED TO COME BEFORE
 CONGRESS AND TESTIFY.
 DO YOU SEE ANY PARALLELS HERE?
 WELL, I THINK THERE ARE
 PARALLELS IN THE SENSE THAT MR.
 McGAHN WAS PRIVYV■r TO A LOT OFE
 ISSUES SURROUNDING, PARTICULARLY
 THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
 CHARGES, WHERE THE INFERENCE WAS
 THE PRESIDENT WAS TAKING STEPS
 REPEATEDLY OR TRYING TO TAKE
 STEPS TO FRUSTRATE THE
 INVESTIGATION.
 FIRING COMEY AND DOING OTHER
 THINGS.
 AND MR. McGAHN WAS THE COUNSEL
 TO THE PRESIDENT AND WAS CLOSELY
 INVOLVED IN THOSE DECISIONS.
 AND I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR FOR
 HIM, NOT ONLY FAIR, IT WOULD BE
 APPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO COME
 BEFORE THE CONGRESS AND THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 AND I THINK HE WOULD ANSWER
 TRUTHFULLY.
 I THINK HE'S A VERY EXCELLENT
 ATTORNEY AND A VERY DECENT
 PERSON AND HE WILLDDWER
 TRUTHFULLY.
 AND THOSE ANSWERS, I THINK, WILL
 HELP.
 ASD WE SPEAK, SENATOR, YOUR
 DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IN THE
 HOUSRE A CONFERENCE
 CALL DIS THIS ENTIRE
 ON OF IMPEACHMENT.
 BASED ON YOUR READING
 MUELLER REPORT, DO YOU BELIEVE
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS COMMITTED
 IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES?
 I THINK THE QUESTION ABOUT
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS STILL
 ONE THAT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT
 VERY CLOSELY.
 AS EVEN ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR
 SAID, IN HIS LETTER TO US
 INITIALLY, MR. MUELLER COULD NOT
 EXONERATE THE PRESIDENT FROM
 THAT CHARGE.
 SO THAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT
 ISSUE.
 WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSPIRAC
 ISSUE, THE BARR LETTER SUGGESTED
 THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.
 BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE
 OBSTRUCTION CHARGE, HE WAS VERY,
 I THINK, SPECIFIC IN QUOTING
 DIRECTLY FROM ALL OF THE REPORT
 THAT HE COULD NOT BE EXONERATED.
 THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT BE
 EXONERATED.
 SO I THINK YOU HAVE AN ISSUE
 THERE.
 AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO
 PROCEED IS THROUGH FURTHER
 INVESTIGATION.
 CALLING FIRST DIRECTOR MUELLER,
 WHO CAN GIVE CONTEXT.
 I MEAN, IF HIS WHOLE REPORT WAS
 BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT HE
 THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE, THAT HE
 COULD NEVER CHARGE THE
 PRESIDENT, BECAUSE THAT WAS A
 POLICY OF THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT, THAT A PRESIDENT
 CANNOT BE CHARGED, CAN ONLY BE
 IMPEACHED, I THINK THAT PUTS
 THIS WHOLE REPORT INTO A
 SPECIFIC CONTEXT THAT WILL BE
 VERY USEFUL.
 AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE TO GET
 THE WHOLE REPORT.
 EVEN THE REDACTED PORTIONS.
 IT COULD BE CONTROLLED IN TERMS
 OF DISTRIBUTION, SO NOT EVERYONE
 GETS TO SEE IT, BUT CRITICAL
 MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
 AISLE GET TO SEE IT.
 AND I THINK WITH THE McGAHN
 TESTIMONY, IT COULD BE -IT
 COD EVEN FURTHER LIGHT ON
 WHAT TOOK
 YOUR SENATE COLLEAGUE,
 SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, A
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM
 MASSACHUSETTS, SHE'S CALLED ON
 THE HOUSE TO BEGINMENT
 PROCEEDINGS.
 IS SHE RIGHT?
 IS THAT NECESSARY RIGHT NOW?
 AT THIS JUNCTURE, I THINK  A
 THE INVESTIGATION.
 THERE'S A CERTAIN POINT WHICH
 THE EVIDENCE AND THE FACTS WILL
 BECOME OBVIOUSLY, I THINK, TO
 ALL, WE HOPE, BUT AT LEAST TO
 SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS, THAT THERE
 IS CULPABILITY HERE.
 AND AT THAT POINT, THAT'S WHEN I
 THINK THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN
 THE HOUSE CAN START FORMAL, IF
 YOU WILL SAY, IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS.
 BUT THERE IS AN OBLIGATION TO
 INVESTIGATE THESE ALLEGATIONS.
 AND TO ESTABLISH THE FACTS,
 ESTABLISH THE EVIDENCE.
 AND AFTER THAT, IF YOU'VE
 REACHED A CRITICAL POINT, AND
 YOU FEEL THAT THERE HAVE BEEN
 HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS,
 WHICH IS A VERY, VERY BROAD
 RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHARGES HAVE
 BEEN REACHED, THEN YOU CAN
 PROCEED.
 AND AGAIN, HAVING BEEN THROUGH
 THIS ONCE BEFORE IN THE '90s,
 THEN IT GOES TO THE FLOOR OF THE
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND
 THAT'S THE VOTE OF THE HOUSE.
 NO PRESIDENT IS IMPEACHED UNTIL
 THE HOUSE, THE WHOLE HOUSE
 VOTES.
 SO THESE JUDICIARY PROCEEDINGS
 ARE APPROPRIATE, USEFUL, AND I
 THINK AT THE INVESTIGATION
 LEVEL, ARE TIMELY AND SHOULD BE
 PURSUED.
 SENATOR REID, THANKOD US.
 THANKS, WOLF!
 UP NEXT, WE'LL PREVIEW A
 MAJOR POLITICAL EVENT.
 CNN PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALLS WITH
 FIVE MAJOR DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES.
 WHAT WILL THEY SAY ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT?
      My experience with USAA
        has been excellent.
      They really appreciate      the military family
       and it really shows.
     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we would call
    another insurance company,
      hey would say      “Oh we can't beat USAA”
     We're the Webber family.
        We're the Tenney's
         We're the Hayles,
 and we're USAA members for life.

 Get your USAA auto insurance quote today.
         [music playing]
 I know what it's like to be in a financially struggling family.
      We had a lot of      leftovers...[chuckles]
      I couldn't have asked      for better parents,
 but like most people they didn't have anyone to teach them
    the best financial habits.
       So we changed that.
   As a financial health coach,   I help people every day.
  I try to put myself in their  shoes from my own experience.
    I connect to them because    I've been there.
    Helping families like mine
       save a little money       changes everything.
  This is personalized guidance.
       This is Wells Fargo.
       Remember that degree       you got in taxation?
       Of course you don't       because you didn't!
    Your job isn't doing hard    work...
   ...it's making them do hard   work...
   ...and getting paid for it.
  Snap and sort your expenses to  save over $4,600 at tax time.
     QUICKBOOKS. BACKING YOU.
   Great. Another wireless ad.
 So many of them are full of this           complicated,
   tricky language about their        network and offers
   and blah blah blah blah blah              blah.
  Look Sprint's gonna do things           differently,
 and let you decide for yourself.
   They're offering a new 100%  Total Satisfaction Guarantee.
  Try it out and see the savings.
  If you don't love it, get your           money back.
           See? Simple.
   Now Sprint's Unlimited Plan
   comes with one of the newest              phones
   included for just $35 a month.
          So switch now.
 WE'RE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS.
 THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
 HAS JUST SUBPOENAED PRESIDENT
 TRUMP'S FORMER WHITE HOUSE
 COUNCIL, DON McGAHN.
 McGAHN'S POSSIBLE TESTIMONY AND
 THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPEACHING
 PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE CERTAIN TO
 COME UP AT TONIGHT'S CNN
 PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALLS.
 JOINING US NOW FROM THE SITE OF
 TONIGHT'S CNN TOWN HALL EVENT,
 OUR SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST,
 MARK PRESTON, AND OUR
 SSIONAL CORRESPONDENT,
 PHIL MATTINGLY.
 MARK, IMPEACHMENT CERTAINLY HAS
 BEEN A HOTOPIC ALL ALONG.
 WILL WE LEARN MORE TONIGHT ABOUT
 WHERE THESE FIVE DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES STAND?
 WOLF, I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF
 WE DON'T LEARN MORE FROM THESE
 CANDIDATES.
 WE'VE HEARD ELIZABETH WARREN UP
 TO THIS POINT HAS REALLY
 REIGNITED IT CERTAINLY ON THE
 CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
 HER DECISION TO GO OUT THERE AND
 SAY THAT SHE THINKS THAT THE
 PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMPEACHED,
 THE HOUSE SHOULD START MOVING
 FORWARD WITH IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS, IS GOING TO FORCE
 THE OTHER CANDIDATES TO HAVE TO
 WEIGH IN ON IT.
 NOW, WE'VE HEARD SOME THINGS,
 BUT WE REALLY HAVEN'T HEARD
 DEFINITIVE ANSWERS UP TOXCXC
 POINT, WOLF.
 VERY INTERESTING, SPEAKING OF
 ELIZABETH WARREN, PHIL, THE
 SENATOR, SHE'LL BE ON THE STAGE
 TONIGHT DURING THE 8:00 P.M. ST.
 HER CAMPAIGN HAS JUST UNVEILED A
 TRULY SWEEPING PROPOSAL
 INVOLVING STUDENT LOAN DEBT, AS
 WELL AS FREE TUITION TO ALL
 PUBLICGES ACR?
 UNITED STATES.
 WHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED?
 YEAH, WOLF, IT'S IN KEEPING
 WITH WHAT SENATOR WARREN HAS
 BEEN DOING THROUGHOUT THE COURSE
 OF HER CAMPAIGN, ROLLING OUT
 SWEEPING PROGRESSIVE, FURTHER
 REACHING THAN ANY OTHER
 CANDIDATE IN THE CAMPAIGN, TYPES
 OF PROPOSALS.
 THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY WOULDACTU
 DEMOCRATS TALKING ABOUT FREE
 CO■RE
 COLLEGE.
 THAT'SNG THAT IS PART
 THISOPOSAL.ART OF ING WARREN TA

 $1.25 TRILLION ACROSS THE  FORGIVE UP TO 75% OF
 THE OUTSTANDING DEBT PROPOSAL I
  $1.25 TRILLION, IF YOU'RE
 MAKING $100,000 OR LESS, YOU
 WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO HAVE
 $50,000 IN FORGIVENESS.
 IT WOULD MOVE AALE F
 SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN REPEATEDLY,
 WHETHER IT'S ON HEALTH CARE OR
 ON FOREIGN POLICY, NOW ON
 STUDENT LOANS, ELIZABETH WARREN
 BELIEVES HER LANE IS THE POLICY
 LANE.
 HER LANE IS IN THE WEEDS POLICY.
 SO FAR, THAT HASN'T NECESSARILY
 BROUGHT HER TO THE TOP OF THE
 POLLS, BUT EVERYTHING YOU'VE
 SEEN AND HEARD HER CAMPAIGN
 OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST
 COUPLE OF WEEKS, THEY'RE
 COMFORTABLE WITH THIS LANE, THEY
 BELIEVE AT SOME POINT IT WILL■?.
 COULD A?RAMATIC PROPOSAL
 LIKE THIS?■■■■< NEEDLE FOR7■NAT?
 I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
 REALLY GOING TO WORK WELL WITH
 THE LIBERAL BASE.
 AND WHEN PHIL TALKS ABOUT HER
 BEING THE POLICY PRESENCE, SHE
 REALLY IS.
 SHE'S STEEPED IN POLICY.
 SHE COMES FROM BEING A COLLEGE
 PROFESSOR, VERY PROFESSORIAL.
 SHE'S ALSO VERY FOCUSED, THOUGH,
 ON LIBERAL POLICIES.
 SO WHEN SHE'S TALKING ABOUT LOAN
 FORGIVENESS AND IMPEACHMENT,
 THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT ARE
 GOING TO PLAY TO THAT LEFT SIDE
 OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHERE
 THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION, AS
 WE KNOW, FOR RIGHT NOW.
 AS PHIL NOTES, NO ONE'S REALLY
 BROKEN OUT EXCEPT FOR BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 BUT THAT MIGHT BE PERHAPS
 BECAUSE OF NAME I.D.
 BUT HE HAS, OF COURSE, A LOT OF
 SUPPORT AND THEY'RE VYING FOR
 THE SAME SUPPORTERS.
 SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO
 CONTRAST NOT ONLY BERNIE
 SANDERS, ELIZABETH WARREN
 TONIGHT, BUT ALSO KAMALA HARRIS
 AND PETE BUTTIGIEG AND AMY
 KLOBUCHAR, WHO SEEMS TO BE THE
 ODD DUCK OUT, BECAUSEHE'S NOT
 NECESS??■■■■;■■ REAL;;? OF ■==■=
  PRESTON, PHIL MATTINGLY,
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 AND TO OUR VIEWERS, STAY WITH
 CNN FOR TONIGHT'S SPECIAL TOWN
 HALL EVENT LIVE FROM NEW
 HAMPSHIRE.
 WE'LL HEAR FROM FIVE OF THE TOP
 DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS WITHIN AN
 EYE ON THE WHITE HOUSE.
 IT ALL STARTS RIGHT AFTER T"THE
 SITUATION ROOM", 7:00 P.M.
 EASTERN.
 COMING UP, THE MUELLER
 REPORT PAINTS A PICTURE OF AFTER
 WHITE HOUSE WHERE TOP OFFICIALS
 ROUTINELY IGNORED POTENTIALLY
 ILLEGAL ORDERS FROM PRESIDENT
 TRUMP.
 BUT THE PRESIDENT INSISTS HE
 REMAINS IN TOTAL CONTROL OF HIS
 ADMINISTRATION.

 BREAKING NEWS. HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
 MEMBERS HAVE JUST SUBPOENAED
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL, DON McGAHN.
 IT COMES AS HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE
 HUDDLING RIGHT NOW IN AN URGENT
 CONFERENCE CALL.
 LET'S GET SOME MORE WITH OUR
 POLITICAL AND LEGAL EXPERTS,
 CHRIS CILLIZZA, DON Mc■@HNNT
 30■ ■ ■  TES■ ■ EFp
 MUELLEEFORE THE X TEAM.
 HOW IMPORTANT WOULD HIS
 TESTIMONY BE BEFORHEOUSE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?
 WELL, I MEAN, I THINK
 IMPORTANT, ONE THING TO YOUR
 POINT THAT MITIGATES IT A LITTLE
 BIT IS HE SPENT 30 HOURS TALKING
 TO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL.
 SO PRESUMABLY, MOST OF WHAT HE
 KNOWS, MUELLER KNEW AND PUT IN
 THE REPORT.
 THAT SAID, THERE ARE SEVERAL
 INSTANCES ( THAT I WOULD LIKE■
 REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WOULD
 LIKE TO HEAR OF THAT
 INVOLVE McGAHN.
 ONE BEING THAT TRUMP SAYS HE
 WANTS McGAHN TO FIRE MUELLER,
 AND HE CALLS HIM BACK WHEN "THE
 NEW YORK TIMES" BREAKS THE NEWS
 AND SAYS, HEY, CAN YOU SAY
 THAT'S NOT TRUE?
 AND McGAHN SAYS, NO, I WON'T DO
 THAT.
 TRUMP HAS SAID THAT DIDN'T
 HAPPEN.
 HE SAID IT AT THE TIME, HE SAID
 IT SINCE.
 YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WOULD
 BENEFIT FROM FURTHER
 EXPLICATION.
 PLUS, THIS IS A GUY, DONALD
 TRUMP, WE KNOW, WALKED UP, SOME
 PEOPLE WOULD SAY BROKE -BUT
 DONALD TRUMP WALKED UP TO THE
 LINE A NUMBER OF TIMES, LEGALLY
 SPEAKING.
 DON McGAHN WAS RIGHT IN THE
 CENTER OF THAT AND MIGHT BE ABLE
 TO SHED EVEN MORE LIGHT ON WHAT
 BOB MUELLER SORT OF SHONE A
 LIGHT ON, ALREADY.
 IT'S ONE THING TO READ HIS
 QUOTES IN THE MUELLER REPORT AND
 ANOTHER THING TO SEE HIM ON
 TELEVISION SAYING THOSE KINDS OF
 THINGS, PRESUMABLY INCLUDING
 SOME MORE.
 THE DEMOCRATS, SUSAN, THEY'RE
 RIGHT NOW■■@ App3aT CONFERENCEC
 DEMOCRATS.
 DO THEY GO FORWARD IMMEDIATELY
 WITH IMPEACHMENT OR■■■■■■■■0■■■.
 HOW DO YOU SEE IT?
 I THINK IT'S TROUBLING TO SEE
 THEM -TO NOT BE PREPARED TO AT
 LEAST LAUNCH AN IMPEACHMENT
 INQUIRY, WHICH IS SEPARATE THAN
 ACTUALLY IMPEACHING SOMEONE.
 YOU KNOW, THE MUELLER REPORT
 HAS -CONTAINS INFORMATION THAT
 IS JUST DEVASTATING.
 IT DESCRIBES A PRESIDENT WHO WAS
 AWARE OF A FOREIGN CAMPAIGN
 CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY TO INTERFERE
 ON THE U.S. ELECTION, WHO
 WELCOMED THAT HELP, WHO LIED TO
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 IT DESCRIBES A PRESIDENT WHO ON
 MULTIPLE OCCASIONS OBSTRUCTED
 JUSTICE.
 AND WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO NOT
 MINCE WORDS HERE.
 YES, ROBERT MUELLER DID NOT MAKE
 THAT ACCUSATION.
 BUT IN THE REPORT, HE LAYS OUT
 WITH EXCRUCIATING DETAIL HOW
 TRUMP'S CONDUCT MET EVERY SINGLE
 STATUTORY ELEMENT OF THE CRIME.
 HE SAYS, THERE ARE NO
 CONSTITUTIONAL OR LEGAL DEFENSES
 FOR THIS CONDUCT.
 HEP JUST DOESN'T SAY THAT LAST
 SENTENCE.
 AND THEREFORE THE PRESIDENT --
 THE PRESIDENT HAS COMMITTED A
 CRIME.
 IN PART BECAUSE A S ■■■ENT, E
 DEPARTMENT, CAN'T BE CHARGED!
 EXACTLY.
 AND HE CLEARLY RELIES ON THIS
 OLC PRECEDENT, IN SAYING, I
 CAN'T EVEN MAKE THIS ACCUSATION,
 BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CAN'T BE
 INDICTED.
 SO IF WHAT HAPPENS IS THE
 DEMOCRATS RESPOND BY MAKING THIS
 A PURELY POLITICAL CALCULATION,
 BASICALLY, DO WE HAVE ENOUGH
 VOTES TO REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE,
 THAT MEANS THAT UNDER THE OLC
 GUIDELINES, THE PRESIDENT CAN'T
 BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH THE
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE
 PRESIDENT CAN'T BE HELD
 ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH THE
 CONGRESSIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL
 MECHANISM.
 I THINK THAT HAS REALLY SCARY
 IMPLICATIONS.
 ALSO, JUST ONE QUICK POINT TO
 ADD, AS SUSAN SAID, MUELLER
 DIDN'T COME OUT AND SAY, DONALD
 TRUMP OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE, BUT HE
 KIND OF SAYS IT IN THE NEGATIVE
 WAY, IN THAT HE SAYS, IF I COULD
 EXONERATE HIM, WE ■ ULD.
 I CAN'T DO THAT.
 WELL, THE LOLUSION IS,
 WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF ■■■HE SAF
■ MUELLER REPORT MAKES
 CLEAR THATND THE CURRENTLY
 OLC GUIDANCE, THISD OF
 INVESTIGATION CAN ONLY EXONERATE
 A PRESIDENT.
 KIT NOT EVEN ACCUSE HIM.
 OLC IS THE OFFICE OF LEGAL
 COUNSEL AT THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT.
 YOU KNOW THAT, WE KNOW THAT,
 SOME OF THE VIEWERS MIGHT NOT
 KNOW WHAT OLC IS.
 SABRINA SIDDIQUI, THE PRESIDENT
 SAYS -SAID IT TODAY, HE'S NOT
 EVEN A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT.
 SHOULD HE BE?
 WELL, I THINK SO LONG AS
 REPUBLICANS ARE IN CONTROL OF
 THE SENATE, IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY
 THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE
 IMPEACHED.
 THAT DOES GO BACK TO SORT OF THE
 POLITICAL CALCULATION THAT
 DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING, WHERE EVEN
 IF HOUSE DEMOCRATS DID MOVE TO
 IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT, THERE
 WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT VOTES IN
 THE SENATE TO ACTUALLY REMOVE
 HIM FROM OFFICE.
 EVEN IF YO LOOK AT THE AFTERMATH
 OF THIS REPORT, WHICH IS
 INCREDIBLY DAMNING AND REALLY
 LAYING BARE THE MANY INSTANCES
 IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT AT A
 MINIMUM SOUGHT TO OBSTRUCT
 JUSTICE, THE SILENCE FROM
 REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL HAS,
 AS USUAL, BEEN DEAFENING, YOU
 HAD SENATOR MITT ROMNEY COME OUT
 AND BE VERY CRITICAL, MORE SO
 THAN HIS COLLEAGUES, OF THE ESI
 DIDN'T ACTUALLY RECOMMEND ANY
 ACTION AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.
 AND OTHER REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE
 TALKED ABOUT THE REPORT HAVE
 ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE NO
 COLLUSION ASPECT OF IT.
 THEY HAVE ALMOST ENTIRELY
 IGNORED THE ALLEGATIONS WITH
 RESPECT TO OBSTRUCTION.
 ANDS THAT WHY DEMOCRATS WANT TO
 BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW THEY
 PURSUE THIS PROCESS, WHEY
 DON'T IMMEDIATELY MOVE FROM THE
 REDACTED REPORT TO IMPEACHMENT,
 BUT THEY SUBPOENA WITNESSES AND
 DOCUMENTS, THEY USE THIS REPORT
 AS A ROAD MAP.
 AND RIALEALLY TRY TO BUILD THE E
 BEFORE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
 SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, THE
 MUELLER REPORT CLEARLY LAYS OUT

 OFFICIALS AND OTH■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
 THE PRESIDENT'S ■, IN PART

 THAT WA KAITLAN COLLINS
 ASKING THAT QUES■dr  ■ ■ ■ HAsaT
  IT'S FACTUALLY UNTRUE,
 ACCORDING TO THE MUELLER REPORT,
 THE WOODWARD BOOK, AND OTHER
 REPORTING.
 AND WOLF, THIS SOUNDS LIKE
 SOMETHING I WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR
 ON AN EPISODE OF "GAME OF
 THRONES" FROM THE MAD KING OR
 QUEEN SCIRCI.
 I SPENT A LOT OF HOURS IN THE
 SITUATION ROOM WITH PRESIDENT
 OBAMA.
 AL OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY DISAGREED
 WITH HIM WHEN HE HAD IDEAS OR
 SUGGESTIONS, INCLUDING HIS LEGAL
 ADVISERS, WHO SAID, MR.
 PRESIDENT, CONSIDER THE LEGAL
 ANGLE OF AN IDEA THAT YOU HAVE.
 WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS SOMETHING
 VERY DIFFERENT.
 WE HAVE STAFF WAGING A SILENT
 MUTINY AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP,
 BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FEEL
 COMFORTABLE SHARING THE LEGALITY
 OF A MATTER DIRECTLY WITH HIM OR
 SAYING HE HAS A BAD IDEA.
 THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE A
 THAT IMPLEMENTS HIS GUIDANCE,
 INCLUDING HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS,
 AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD
 HAVE WHITE HOUSE STAFF THAT'S
 NOT WORKING HOURS IN THE DAY,
 MANAGING THE PRESIDENT'S WORST
 IMPULSES, BUT INSTEAD, THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE
 A TEAM THAT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK,
 ACTUALLY MANAGING OUR NATIONAL
 SECURITY.
 WELL, IN DISOBEYING HIM, JUST
 ONE QUICK THING, IN DISOBEYING
 HIM, IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST
 THING THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE
 FOR HIM, LEGALLY SPEAKING.
 DON McGAHN CARRIES OUT DONALD
 TRUMP'S ORDER TO FIRE BOB
 MUELLER, WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT
 PLACE TODAY THAN WE WERE.
 IF REX TILLERSON SAID
 REPEATEDLY, HE ASKED ME TO DO
 THINGS AND I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO
 HIM THEY WERE AGAINST THE LAW.
 SO DISOBEYING MY ORDERS CAN MEAN
 APPLYING THE LAW, THAT'S SCARY.
 EVEROUND.
 THERE'S MORE NEWS WE'RE
 FOLLOWING, INCLUDING BREAKING
 NEWS INTO THE INVESTIGATION AS
 TO WHO MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
 THE DEADLY SUICIDE ATTACKS ON
 CHURCHES AND HOTELS.
  I don't keep track of regrets.
  And I don't add up the years.
    But what I do count on...
            is BOOST®.
         <i> Delicious BOOST®</i>  <i> High Protein Nutritional Drink</i>
     <i> has 20 grams of protein,</i>
        <i> with 26 essential</i>      <i> vitamins and minerals.</i>
       <i> BOOST® High Protein.</i>
    <i> Look for savings on BOOST®</i>
      <i> in your Sunday paper.</i>
      Don't tell your mother.
          Dad, it's fine.
          We have<i> ALLSTATE.</i>
     <i> AND WITH CLAIMRATEGUARD</i>   <i> THEY WON'T RAISE YOUR RATES</i>
    <i> JUST BECAUSE OF A CLAIM.</i>
 That's why you're my favorite...
             <i> I KNOW.</i>
     <i> ARE YOU IN GOOD HANDS?</i>

          Be right back.
           With moderate    to severe Crohn's disease,
       I was there, just not   always where I needed to be.
          Is she alright?
            I hope so.
     So I talked to my doctor           about HUMIRA.
  I learned HUMIRA is for people      who still have symptoms
        of Crohn's disease  after trying other medications.
         And the majority        of people on HUMIRA
  saw significant symptom relief    and many achieved remission
     in as little as 4 weeks.
  <i> HUMIRA can lower your ability</i>       <i> to fight infections,</i>
     <i> including tuberculosis.</i>
     <i> Serious, sometimes fatal</i>     <i> infections and cancers,</i>
     <i> including lymphoma, have</i> <i>happened; as have blood, liver,</i>
   <i> and nervous system problems,</i>   <i> serious allergic reactions,</i>
       <i> and new or worsening</i>          <i> heart failure.</i>
        <i> Before treatment,</i>        <i> get tested for TB.</i>
         <i> Tell your doctor</i>     <i> if you've been to areas</i>
 <i>where certain fungal infections</i>           <i> are common,</i>
      <i> and if you've had TB,</i>           <i> hepatitis B,</i>
 <i>are prone to infections, or have</i>   <i> flu-like symptoms or sores.</i>
        <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i>    <i> if you have an infection.</i>
    Be there for you, and them.
    Ask your gastroenterologist           about HUMIRA.
           With HUMIRA,      remission is possible.










              AHHHH!

 COMING UP, A SURPRISING TWIST IN
 THE WAKE OF A DARING RAID ON ONE
 OFOREA'S EMBASSIES.
      My experience with USAA
        has been excellent.
      They really appreciate      the military family
       and it really shows.
     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we would call
    another insurance company,
      hey would say      “Oh we can't beat USAA”
     We're the Webber family.
        We're the Tenney's
         We're the Hayles,
 and we're USAA members for life.

 FIND HIM THERE.
 A SOURCE CLOSE TO HONG SHARED

 ADRIAN HONG HAS GONNA GROUND.
 HE CERTAINLY FEARS FOR HIS
 SAFETY.
 WE DO HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
 THAT NORTH KOREAN HIT SQUADS
 HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO TARGET
 MR. HONG.
 Reporter: ADRIAN HONG IS A
 LEAD EFFORT OF THE GROUP ONCE
 KNOWN AS CHILE MASS CIVIL
 DEFENSE.
 IT IS A BRUTAL TOTALITARIAN
 REGIME.
 Reporter: THEY WANT TO BE

 MUCH FREE GISAN, A SWORN ENEMY
 OF KIM'S REGIME.
 THE GOAL IS TO OVERTHROW THE
 REGIME AND BRING HUMAN RIGHTS
 AND OTHER FREEDOMS TO NORTH
 KOREA.
 Reporter: A FORMER NORTH
 KOREAN AN ALLEGED MEMBER OF THE
 GROUP WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY
 U.S. MARSHALS IN LOS ANGELES ON
 THURSDAY, THOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR
 WHAT HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH.
 HIS CASE IS UNDER SEAL AND HIS
 LAWYER HASN'T COMMENTED.
 THIS IS A PICTURE OF AHN TAKEN
 WITH THE SON OF KIM JONG-UN'S
 HALF BROTHER.
 ACCORDING TO ADRIAN HONG'S
 LAWYER, CHRISTOFFER AHN HELPED
 EXTRACT THAT YOUNG MAN AND HIS
 FAMILY FROM MACAU TO A SAFE
 LOCATION TWO YEARS AGO.
 SHORTLY AFTER KIM ALLEGEDLY HAD
 HIS HALF BROTHER MURDERED AT AN
 AIRPORT IN MALAYSIA.
 IT'S NOT CLEAR IF AHN WAS
 INVOLVED IN THE RAID ON THE
 EMBASSY IN SPAIN ON FEBRUARY
 22nd.
 HONG'S LAWYER ADMITS HIS CLIENT
 WAS.
 HE SAYS THE GROUP WAS INVITED
 INSIDE AND WASN'T VIOLENT.
 SPANISH OFFICIALS SAY ADRIAN
 HONG CAUGHT A PLANE TO THE U.S.
 SHORTLY AFTER THE EMBASSY RAID
 AND HONG'S GROUP SAYS IT SHARED
 THE MATERIAL TAKEN FROM THE RAID
 WITH THE FBI AT THE FBI'S
 REQUEST.
 WHAT COULD THE BUREAU LEARN
 ABOUT OPERATIONS AT THAT NORTH
 KOREAN EMBASSY?
 THE NORTH KOREANS, WE
 SUSPECT, ARE INVOLVED IN
 NARCOTICS, IN MURDER, ALL SORTS
 OF THINGS, AND GET CONFIRMATION
 OF THIS HARD INTELLIGENCE IS
 VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AND YOU
 NEVER GET AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE
 THIS.
 Reporter: ADRIAN HONG'S
 ATTORNEY TELLS US HE IS
 CONCERNED THAT IF HIS CLIENT IS
 TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, HE MIGHT
 EVENTUALLY BE EXTRADITED TO
 NORTH KOREA.
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHILE NOT
 COMMENTING ON ANY OTHER ASPECT
 OF THIS CASE HAS TOLD CNN THAT
 ESSENTIALLY IT WOULD NOT TRY TO
 FACILITATE THAT EXTRADITION.
 THE FBI, WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT ANY
 INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
 SHARED WITH THE BUREAU FROM THAT
 RAID AT NORTH KOREA'S EMBASSY IN
 MADRID WOULD NOT COMMENT ON ANY
 OF THIS.
