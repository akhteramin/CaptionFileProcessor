 HI, EVERYONE, WELCOME TO "ON THE MONEY.
 I'M BECKY QUICK.
 A HELPING HAND FOR THOSE
 STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET,
 AND ONE THING THAT COULD MAKE A
 BIG DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES.
 THE RATE OF POVERTY HERE IS
 THREE TIMES WHAT YOU SEE IN THE
 NATION AS A WHOLE.
 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB,
 NOW IS A GOOD TIME
 IF YOU'RE HIRING, MAYBE NOT.
 THE SKILLS EMPLOYERS WANT, AND
 HOW YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR VALUE.
 YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO DO THAT IF
 YOU'RE A HEALTH CARE WORKER.
 IF YOU LIKE LIGHTS, SIRENS, AND
 SAVING LIVES, THERE COULD BE A
 CAREER FOR YOU
 AND WILL GIVING DOGS PEOPLE
 FOOD MAKE THEM HEALTHIER AND
 HAPPIER?
 ONE COMPANY IS BETTING THE FARM
 ON IT.
 "ON THE MONEY" STARTS RIGHT NOW.
 THIS IS "ON THE MONEY," YOUR
 MONEY, YOUR LIFE, YOUR FUTURE.
 NOW, BECKY QUICK
 WE BEGIN WITH A STORY THAT
 MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT BUT
 SHOULD
 A STAGGERING NUMBER-- ONE IN
 FOUR U.S. HOUSEHOLDS ARE
 ACTUALLY NDERBANKED OR
 UNBANKED
 THAT MEANS THEY EITHER DON'T
 HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT OR HAVE ONE
 BUT STILL NEED TO USE EXPENSIVE
 SERVICES LIKE PAYDAY LOANS JUST
 TO MAKE ENDS MEET.
 STEVE LEASEMAN DUG INTO THIS
 IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA, HE
 FOUND THE STORY OF A FAMILY, A
 FIRE, AND A FOCUS ON THE
 FINANCIAL SYSTEM
 Reporter: TWO FIRES IN THEIR
 HOMES IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA
 LEFT FARRAH APPLEBURY AND HER
 GIRLS DESTITUTE.
 WE PRAYED IN UNISON BECAUSE I
 DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE ANOTHER
 HOME
 AND ONE OF MY GIRLS SAID, "MAMA,
 IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT
 GOD GOT US," THAT THIS, TOO,
 SHALL PASS
 Reporter: ALONG LITERALLY
 CAME HOPE.
 A CREDIT UNION FOCUSED ON
 ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED AREAS IN
 THE SOUTH THAT BRINGS BASIC
 BANKING SERVICES TO THE NATION'S
 POOREST.
 THE RATE OF POVERTY HERE IS
 THREE TIMES WHAT YOU SEE IN THE
 NATION AS A WHOLE, EVEN GREATER
 FOR THE REGION'S
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN RESIDENTS
 IF YOU LOOK AT LEVEL OF BANKING
 SERVICES, THREE TIMES THE LEVEL
 OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A
 BANKING ACCOUNT.
 AND WHEN YOU ADD THE NUMBER OF
 PEOPLE WHO USE CHECK CASHERS AND
 PAYDAY LENDERS, BETWEEN 60% TO
 70% OF THE MEMBERS WHO JOIN OUR
 CREDIT UNION WERE OUTSIDE THE
 BANKING SYSTEM OR ON THE EDGE OF
 THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, PAYING
 HIGH RATES OR DID NOT HAVE BASIC
 TOOLS TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES
 AND STABILIZE THEIR FINANCIAL
 LIVES.
 Reporter: YOU CAN SEE THE
 ABSENCE OF BANKING SERVICES IN
 POOR TOWNS LIKE THIS THROUGHOUT
 THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA.
 NATIONALLY, ONE IN FOUR
 AMERICANS IS ESTIMATED TO BE
 UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED, MEANING
 THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC
 BANKING SERVICES
 SOME LIVE IN BANKING DESERTS
 WHERE THERE JUST AREN'T BRANCHES
 FOR MILES.
 SOME DON'T TRUST BANKS, AND SOME
 THINK THEY'RE JUST TOO POOR TO
 OPEN AN ACCOUNT.
 BUT THERE'S ALSO MORE FOCUS ON
 THE ISSUE.
 RECENTLY FED CHAIRMAN JEROME
 POWELL MADE AN HISTORIC TRIP TO
 THE DELTA, SPEAKING TO STUDENTS
 AND ATTENDING A CONFERENCE WITH
 INVESTORS, BANKERS, AND
 COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS TO SHINE A
 SPOTLIGHT ON THE PROBLEM OF THE
 UNBANKED
 ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE
 FINANCIAL SERVICES IS VITAL,
 ESPECIALLY AMONG FAMILIES WITH
 LIMITED WEALTH
 WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING TO
 INVEST IN EDUCATION, START A
 BUSINESS, OR SIMPLY MANAGE THE
 UPS AND DOWNS OF LIFE.
 Reporter: ACCESS TO BANKING
 IS SUCH A PROBLEM DOWN HERE THAT
 IT WAS ONLY IN 2015 THAT HOPE
 OPENED THE TOWN'S FIRST BANK
 ATM.
 WHEN HOPE CAME IN, THEY --
 THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THEY
 DID.
 THEY KNOCKED A HOLE IN THE WALL
 AND PUT AN ATM MACHINE THERE
 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE BUSINESS
 THAT YOU COULD CONDUCT HERE IN
 MOORHEAD
 Reporter: FINANCIAL
 COUNSELING MEANS FARRAH SHOULD
 BE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY BY
 NOVEMBER
 ONCE I GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCY,
 I KNOW IT MAY NOT BE THE FATTEST
 ACCOUNT, BUT I'M LOOKING TO HAVE
 ENOUGH MONEY IN HOPE THAT IF I
 HAVE A DRY DAY, ME AND MY GIRLS
 WILL STILL MAKE IT
 SO I HAD TO LEARN TO SAVE SMALL
 TO GET TO BE
 Reporter: FOR THE UNBANKED
 TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF
 POVERTY, SOME ACCOUNT, NO MATTER
 WHAT SIZE, IS BETTER THAN NO
 ACCOUNT AT ALL
 AND FINANCIAL EXPERTS SAY MRS.
 APPLEBERRY IS RIGHT.
 ANY ACCOUNT NO MATTER HOW SMALL
 IS BETTER THAN NONE.
 THE GROWING CHALLENGE --
 COMMUNITY BANKS ARE CLOSING,
 TECHNOLOGY'S ELIMINATING THE
 NEED FOR BRANCHES.
 MOREAND MORE, POOR COMMUNITIES
 HAVE LESS AND LESS ACCESS TO THE
 BANKING SERVICES THEY NEED,
 BECKY.
 WHEN I'VE TALKED TO OTHER
 PEOPLE, THEY SAY, YES, BUT YOU
 CAN DO SO MUCH WITH YOUR PHONE
 YOU CAN DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS
 THERE.
 HOW COME THAT DOESN'T TRANSLATE
 TO HELPING PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES
 WHERE THEY NEED IT
 TECHNOLOGY CREATES A PROMISE,
 BUT YOU HAVE TO LEAP OVER THE
 IDEA THAT SOME OF THEM DON'T
 HAVE BANKING ACCOUNTS, RIGHT
 THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN DO SO MUCH
 WITH THIS PHONE AND YET SOME
 PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS
 TTO
 ATMs, TO BRIDGE THE TECHNOLOGY
 BANKS ARE CLOSING DOWN, MANY ARE
 GOING AWAY
 SO THE MORE TECHNOLOGY GOES
 FORWARD, THE MORE THESE PEOPLE
 GET LEFT BEHIND.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COMMUNITY
 BANKS ALSO PROVIDE SOMETHING, A
 LITTLE COUNSELING ALMOST, TO
 WALK YOU THROUGH THE IT.
 YOU NEED THAT PERSONAL TOUCH
 ABSOLUTELY.
 ON THE BROADER LEVEL, BECKY,
 BANKING AND LENDING IS BECOMING
 A COMMODITY.
 YOU CAN GO ON LINE AND FILL OUT
 A FORM TO GET A LOAN, AND YOU
 CAN GET AN ANSWER WHEN YOU HIT
 ENTER.
 IT'S COMMODITIZED BASED ON YOUR
 INCOME AND CREDIT STORY.
 PEOPLE LIKE MS. APPLEBERRY NEED
 INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING.
 THE WAY THEY LOOK AT HER AND
 OTHER LENDING THERE IS PIECE BY
 PIECE.
 SOME CASES THEY USE CABLE BILLS
 TO SHOW YOUR FINANCIAL --
 ABILITY TO REPAY
 THAT ONE-ON-ONE SERVICE IS GOING
 AWAY IN THE BROADER BANKING
 BUSINESS
 THANK YOU
 AN EXCELLENT STORY
 I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT TO US.
 THANK YOU
 STEVE LEASEMAN.
 HOPE CREDIT UNION IS ONE OF
 NEARLY 1,200 COMMUNITY
 DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL
 INSTITUTIONS OR CDFIs, THAT ARE
 IMPROVING COMMUNITIES AND
 PROVIDING THE UNDERBANKED AND
 UNBANKED ACCESS TO MAINSTREAM
 FINANCE.
 JOINING US IS LISA MENSA,
 PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE
 OPPORTUNITY FINANCE NETWORK.
 LISA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
 BEING HERE
 THANK YOU
 YOUR ORGANIZATION DOES THIS
 YOU HELP CDFIs SO THEY CAN
 PROVIDE AFFORDABLE SERVICES LIKE
 THIS
 HOW DOES IT WORK
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 WE HELP GET THE MONEY, AMPLIFY
 THE VOICE AND STRENGTHEN THE
 NATION'S COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
 WE'RE ABOUT 1,200 ACROSS THE
 NATION
 WE MANAGE ABOUT $150 BILLION IN
 ASSETS COLLECTIVELY.
 AND OUR JOB IS TO HELP THOSE
 CREDIT UNIONS AND LOAN FUNDS AND
 COMMUNITY BANKS DO MORE, HELP
 MORE PEOPLE, SO THAT THEY CAN
 MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES
 IT'S KIND OF A STAGGERING
 STATISTIC WHEN YOU'RE THINKING
 THAT 25%, ONE IN FOUR HOUSEHOLDS
 ARE ACTUALLY IN NEED OF
 ADDITIONAL BANKING
 THEY'RE UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED.
 WHAT -- WHAT HAPPENED, IS THIS
 UNUSUAL, WHEN WE DIG INTO THIS,
 WHAT ARE THE REASONS BEHIND WHY
 THEY DON'T HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS?
 YEAH.
 IT'S BOTH PERSONAL AND SYSTEMIC.
 AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS
 STORY IN MISSISSIPPI SHOWED.
 WE'RE SO GLAD THAT CHAIRMAN
 POWELL PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS
 IN SOME CASES, IT'S PERSONAL
 THERE HAVE BEEN BANKRUPTCIES OR
 FIRES OR THINGS.
 THE GOOD PART ABOUT WORKING WITH
 CDFIs IS THAT CDFIs HELP THE
 PEOPLE GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES
 BUT ALSO HELP THE PLACES RISE.
 YOU ALSO NEED NOT JUST TRANSACT
 BUT TO GET READY FOR A MORTGAGE,
 TO HELP SEND KIDS TO SCHOOL, AND
 TO DO THE THINGS THAT HELP MOVE
 YOU INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS.
 THAT'S WHERE THESE
 MISSION-ORIENTED LOAN FUNDS OR
 BANKS OR CREDIT UNIONS ARE VERY
 STRONG
 WHAT YOU SAY, WHERE WE TALK
 ABOUT IT BEING A SYSTEMIC
 PROBLEM, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
 HARD TO BREAK THE CYCLE IF YOU
 HAVEN'T SEEN ACCESS TO THIS IN
 THE PAST, IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
 TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL, IF YOU
 HAVEN'T WATCHED IT HAPPEN AT
 HOME, IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT ON
 YOUR OWN
 IT'S NOT INTUITIVE, A LOT OF IT.
 IT'S NOT INTUITIVE.
 HAVING A STRONG PARTNER, AN
 OLD-FASHIONED COMMUNITY
 DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL
 INSTITUTION THAT WILL GIVE YOU
 SOME ADVICE, BUT ALSO PROVIDE
 YOU WITH AN ACCOUNT SO THAT YOU
 START BREAKING THE CYCLE
 YOU ACTUALLY GET A GOOD CREDIT
 HISTORY.
 AND THEY WANT TO BE THERE FOR
 THAT NEXT LOAN, FOR THE LOAN FOR
 THE HOUSE, THE -- THE HELP FOR
 THE COMMUNITY.
 WE LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS
 MAYOR'S BEST FRIEND BECAUSE
 WE'LL HELP IN OTHER ASPECTS OF
 HELPING A COMMUNITY.
 DO THE CDFIs MAKE MONEY, AS
 WELL
 IT'S NOT JUST A CHARITABLE
 ORGANIZATION, RIGHT?
 THEY'RE NOT
 WE ARE PROFITABLE, BUT WE'RE NOT
 PROFIT MAXIMIZING.
 WE SEEK TO MAXIMIZE IMPACTS.
 WE HELP MORE PEOPLE GET JOBS,
 MORE PEOPLE MOVE INTO MORTGAGES.
 WE ARE PROFITABLE.
 HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY BEGIN TO
 EDUCATE PEOPLE
 IS IT AS EASY AS SETTING UP A
 BANK IN A COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE
 SUDDENLY START TO TRUST A BANK
 THAT MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T TOUCHED
 IN THE PAST?
 IT SEEMS THAT'S A BIT OF A LEAP.
 WHAT HOPE DID AND WHAT THAT
 CREDIT UNION WAS ABLE TO DO IS
 THEY DID SET UP, AND THEY TAKE
 TIME WITH PEOPLE
 SOMETIMES THIS WAS PEOPLE'S
 FIRST ACCOUNT.
 THEY HAD A HISTORY OF BEING JUST
 WITH PAYDAY LENDERS OR CHECK
 CASHERS.
 BEING CLOSE ACTUALLY DID START
 TO -- ON THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL.
 BUT CDFIs WORK BEYOND THE
 INDIVIDUAL LEVEL
 WE ACTUALLY ALSO WORK WITH THE
 MAYOR, AND WE HELP GET A WHOLE
 COMMUNITY'S HOUSING IMPROVED
 WHAT STEVE TALKED ABOUT, THE
 IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY, THE IDEA
 THAT THE FUTURE OF THE BANK
 BRANCH IS UNCERTAIN OR -- WHAT
 WE KNOW CERTAINLY IS THEY'RE
 PROBABLY GOING TO BE -- THERE
 ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE FEWER
 AS PEOPLE DO MORE ON LINE, DOES
 THAT IMPACT THIS MISSION, AS
 WELL
 IT DOES
 SURE, MAINSTREAM BANKING IS
 CHANGING, BUT THAT'S WHERE THIS
 INDUSTRY, THE CDFI INDUSTRY
 WHICH HAS HAD OVER 30 YEARS TO
 PRACTICE MAKING GOOD LOANS AND
 WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS AND
 WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES, WE'RE
 READY NOW TO ACTUALLY DO MORE AS
 THE BANKING INDUSTRY CHANGES
 SOME FOLKS ARE LEFT OUT, AND
 THIS IS WHEN WE'RE PREPARED TO
 STEP IN AND HELP MOVE PEOPLE
 FORWARD.
 LISA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
 YOUR TIME TODAY.
 THANK YOU
 UP NEXT, WE ARE "ON THE
 MONEY.
 IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WORK,
 EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING FOR YOU.
 THE JOB SKILLS IN HIGHEST
 DEMAND
 THEY MAY NOT BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU
 THINK.
 AND LATER, CARING FOR THE
 SICK AND INJURED IS A CRITICAL
 JOB.
 WE RELY ON EMTs TO BE FIRST
 RESPONDERS IN AN EMERGENCY

 CALLING.

 ARE YOU FEELING STUCK IN A RUT AT WORK?
 WELL, GUESS WHAT, NOW MAY BE THE
 PERFECT TIME TO LAND THE JOB
 THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED.
 A NEW REPORT FROM CAREER BUILDER
 SAYS THAT 40% OF EMPLOYERS PLAN
 TO HIRE THIS YEAR.
 SENIOR PERSONAL FINANCE
 CORRESPONDENT SHARON EPPERSON
 JOINS US WITH MORE AND WHAT IT
 MEANS FOR YOU IF YOU'RE ON THE
 JOB HUNT
 GREAT TO SEE YOU
 GOOD TO BE HERE
 WHAT ARE THE TOP SKILLS THAT
 EMPLOYERS ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING
 FOR NOW?
 A LOT OF FOLKS ARE ON THE JOB
 HUNT, AND MANY ARE WORRIED THAT
 THEIR SKILLS MAY BE OUTDATED,
 MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW THE LATEST
 IN TECHNOLOGY, SO ARE THEY THE
 RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR THESE JOBS
 CAREER BUILDER FOUND THAT 80% OF
 EMPLOYERS SAID SOFT SKILLS ARE
 JUST AS IMPORTANT AS HARD SKILLS

 WHAT ARE SOFT SKILLS?
 MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT.
 SOFT SKILLS ARE LIKE GETTING
 ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE, BEING
 ABLE TO WORK ON A TEAM, BEING
 ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL
 AND GET THAT TASK DONE, AND
 BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH
 CUSTOMERS NOT JUST OUTSIDE OF
 YOUR COMPANY BUT INSIDE, AS
 WELL
 HOW CAN THEY FIGURE THAT OUT?
 WHEN I'M ON AN INTERVIEW WITH
 THEM
 THAT'S TOUGH
 THAT'S THEANECDOTES, THE
 STORIES THAT YOU TELL.
 YOU HAVE TO QUANTIFY IT IN YOUR
 RESUME AND COMMUNICATION WITH
 THE EMPLOYER
 WHAT ARE THE AREAS IN
 GREATEST DEMAND WHEN IT COMES TO
 HIRING FULL-TIME WORKER, AND
 WHERE ARE THEY
 THE GREATEST DEMAND IS FOR
 SKILLED LABOR STILL.
 BUT THAT'S IN MANY INDUSTRIES,
 AND NOT JUST IN MANUFACTURING.
 ALSO IMPORTANT, DATA ANALYSIS,
 DIGITAL MARKETING,
 CYBERSECURITY.
 THOSE ARE THE TOP FOUR
 IF I'M LOOKING AT THAT LIST
 AND THINKING HOW DO I GET MYSELF
 SOME OF THESE SKILLS, WHAT --
 WHAT DO I NEED DO?
 THE GOOD THING TO KNOW IS YOU
 CAN LOOK ANYWHERE IN THE
 COUNTRY.
 EVEN THOUGH THE WEST AND SOUTH
 HAVE MOST OF THOSE JOBS WHERE
 THEY'RE HIRING FOR 2019, IT'S
 PRETTY WELL SPREAD OUT
 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
 THAT'S GOOD NEWS
 IN TERMS OF HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF
 STAND OUT, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
 THINGS YOU NEED DO
 FIRST OF ALL, THAT RESUME IS
 GOING TO BE KEY.
 YOU NEED UPDATE THAT RESUME WITH
 NEW SKILLS
 HOW DO YOU DO THAT
 SAY YOU WANTED TO LEARN SOME
 TYPE OF NEW COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
 SKILL OR SOFTWARE SKILLS, YOU
 CAN TAKE A CLASS ON THAT, OR YOU
 CAN WORK ON A PROJECT THAT
 ALLOWS YOU TO DO IT.
 LEARN BY DOING
 SO WHETHER THAT'S VOLUNTEERING
 FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT LETS
 YOU DO IT OR FINDING ANOTHER
 DEPARTMENT WITHIN YOUR COMPANY
 THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO WORK ON
 SOMETHING, THAT'S ONE OF THE
 KEYS YOU WANT TO DO.
 YOU TAKE THAT INFORMATION, YOU
 PUT IT ON YOUR RESUME.
 IT'S EXPERIENCE.
 EVEN IF IT'S VOLUNTEER WORK,
 IT'S STILL EXPERIENCE IN A KEY
 AREA
 AND MAKE SURE YOU FIGURE OUT
 WHAT THOSE RELEVANT WORDS ARE
 THAT THE EMPLOYER IS LOOKING FOR
 AND YOU PUT THEM EVERYWHERE, IN
 YOUR RESUME, IN YOUR COVER
 LETTER
 IT'S YOUR SPIN WHEN YOU HAVE THE
 INTERVIEW.
 AND IT'S ON YOUR LINKEDIN
 PROFILE.
 THE LAST THING THAT'S IMPORTANT
 IS ALWAYS STAY POSITIVE AND
 EXUDE CONFIDENCE
 EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LIKE I DON'T
 KNOW IF I GOT THIS, YOU GOT TO
 MAKE SURE THE EMPLOYER THINKS
 YOU HAVE IT.
 THAT YOU'RE A VALUE, AND THAT
 YOU'RE GOING TO ADD VALUE TO THE
 COMPANY.
 GOOD ADVICE
 SHARON, THANK YOU.
 SURE.
 SHARON EPPERSON
 THE SKILLS OF PARAMEDICS AND
 EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS
 ARE IN HIGH DEMAND
 WHETHER THEY'RE RESPONDING TO AN
 ACCESS OR ILLNESS, THEIR SPEED
 AND ACTIONS SAVE LIVES
 MANY RURAL AND URBAN LOCATIONS
 ARE FINDING THOSE CRUCIAL JOBS
 HARD TO FILL
 WE WENT TO MAINE TO FIND OUT
 WHY.
 [ SIREN
 Reporter: ON ANY GIVEN DAY,
 ERIC MAILMAN COULD TRANSPORT A
 BABY, REQUIRING INTENSIVE CARE
 FROM ONE HOSPITAL TO ANOTHER, OR
 HELP AN ELDERLY PATIENT IN C
 CARDIAC ARREST
 HE COULD ANSWER BETWEEN FOUR AND
 17 CALLS A DAY ON SHIFTS THAT
 STRETCH WELL BEYOND 24 HOURS
 THE ONLY GUARANTEE IS HIS DAYS
 AND NIGHTS WILL BE BUSY AND
 UNPREDICTABLE.
 IF IT'S A SLOW DAY, THEN YOU
 -- YOU'RE DOING WELL
 THOSE DAYS WHERE THE DEMAND IS
 HIGH, YOU HAVE THE INCREASED
 CALL VOLUME THAT, YOU KNOW,
 EVERYONE DECIDES TO BE SICK ALL
 AT ONE TIME, THEN YOU'RE REALLY
 -- YOU'RE REALLY STRUGGLING.
 Reporter: MAILMAN WORKS AT
 NORTHERN LIGHT HEALTH WHERE 170
 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN EMERGENCY
 MEDICAL SERVICES
 BUT THE RURAL MAIN SYSTEM IS IN
 NEED OF ABOUT 10% MORE EMS
 STAFFERS, AND HIRING IS PROVING
 INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING
 IN A TIGHT LABOR MARKET ARE
 FEWER PEOPLE ARE ENTER THE
 PROFESSION
 UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW
 THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT.
 THIS IS A JOB THAT PEOPLE USED
 TO GET INTO, YOU KNOW, ONE OF
 THE MORE COMMON PATHWAYS WAS
 THROUGH VOLUNTEERISM
 AND VOLUNTEER YIRK --
 VOLUNTEERISM IS WAY DOWN
 Reporter: SOME 37,000 EMT AND
 PARAMEDIC JOBS WILL BE ADDED
 THROUGH 2026 ACCORDING TO BLS.
 DEMAND FOR EMS WORKERS COMES AT
 A TIME WHEN THE HEALTH CARE
 SECTOR IS ADDING A MYRIAD OF
 JOBS
 SOME 42,000 WERE ADDED IN
 JANUARY AS THE POPULATION
 CONTINUES TO AGE AND SEEK CARE,
 AND WORKERS AGE OUT OF THEIR
 ROLES IN THE INDUSTRY.
 A STRONG JOB MARKET IS ALSO
 HAVING ANOTHER EFFECT.
 MORE PEOPLE WITH HEALTH
 BENEFITS, MORE PEOPLE WITH
 INSURANCE INCREASES DEMAND FOR
 HEALTH CARE.
 AND THEREFORE, HEALTH JOBS
 Reporter: ONE THING IS FOR
 SURE -- AS MORE PEOPLE SEEK
 CARE, WORKERS LIKE MAILMAN WILL
 BE READY TO ANSWER THE CALL.
 YOU GET TO STEP INTO THE
 CHAOS OF THE WORST DAY OF
 SOMEBODY'S LIFE AND BRING CALM,
 BRING PEACE, AND HAVE THE
 ABILITY TO STEP IN AND HELP
 SOMEBODY ON THEIR WORST DAY.
 THAT TO ME IS PRICELESS.
 Reporter: BEYOND A WORKER
 SHORTAGE, THERE'S A FUNDING
 ISSUE FOR PROGRAMS
 SOME COMMUNITIES AS
 REIMBURSEMENTS FROM INSURERS AND
 MEDICAID AND MEDICARE ARE
 OUTPACED BY WAGE PRESSURES AND
 COSTS TO OPERATE
 THIS CAN BE COMMON IN VOLUNTEER
 PROGRAMS FUNDED LARGELY BY
 DONATIONS AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS
 WHAT ARE THE PAY AND BENEFITS
 SITUATIONS FOR WORKERS LIKE
 THIS
 THEY'LL CERTAINLY VARY.
 BUT ON AVERAGE, I THINK PAY WAS
 AROUND $30,000 A YEAR, $33,000 A
 YEAR, THE MEDIAN PAY
 WOW
 YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BE TRAINED
 BEFORE YOU WALK IN THE DOOR BY
 VOLUNTEERING YOUR TIME TO GET
 THAT DONE.
 THAT'S A BIG ASK
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 AND ALSO, THOUGH, DEPENDING
 WHERE YOU WORK, SOME OF THEM ARE
 WILLING TO DO SOME TUITION
 REIMBURSEMENT BECAUSE IT IS
 HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND THESE
 PEOPLE
 ALL RIGHT, KATE, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH
 THANK YOU
 NEXT, WE'RE "ON THE MONEY.
 A HUNGRY DOG WILL EAT WHATEVER
 IS IN THE BOWL
 BUT IS FRESHLY MADE FOOD
 HEALTHIER AND WORTH THE HIGHER
 COST
 ONE BUSINESS IS BETTING THE
 FARM
             Termites.
        We're on the move.
      Hey Rick, all good?
      Oh yeah, we're good.
           We're good.
          Terminix.      Defenders of Home.
 DOG FOOD USED TO COME OUT OF A CAN OR A SCOOP FROM A
 TEN-POUND BAG.
 TODAY, MORE PET OWNERS ARE
 WATCHING WHAT'S IN THE MEALS
 THEY GIVE THEIR PETS
 AS SUE HERRERA FOUND, IT WAS THE
 SEARCH FOR A HEALTHY FOOD FOR A
 SICK DOG THAT LED TWO
 ENTREPRENEURS TO SEE IF THEY
 WERE BARKING UP THE RIGHT TREE
 Reporter: FOR TWO YEARS, JADA
 SUFFERED WITH STOMACH ISSUES
 HER OWNER, BRET PADULSKI, TRIED
 ALL KINDS OF FOODS FROM KIBBLES
 TO CANS, AND FREEZE-DRIED TO
 RAW.
 HE WAS CONSTANTLY RUNNING HOME
 TO CHECK ON JADA
 I FELT SO BAD FOR HER
 IT WAS -- IT WAS A -- LIKE A
 HEARTBREAKING TIME PERIOD.
 Reporter: IN 2014, A VET
 SUGGESTED HOME COOKING
 HUMAN FOOD, BEEF AND VEGETABLES.
 JONATHAN REGEV, THAT'S HIS DOG
 BUDDY, ROOMED WITH PADULSKY AT
 THE TIME
 I'M LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 HE SAID, I'M COOKING FOR JADA.
 I THOUGHT HE WAS INSANE.
 I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYBODY COOKING
 FOR THEIR DOG BEFORE
 IT WAS LIKE MAGIC
 ALL OF HER SYMPTOMS DISAPPEARED.
 Reporter: UNABLE TO USE A
 PRODUCT USING THE USDA'S
 STANDARD FOR HUMAN FOOD, THEY
 KEPT COOKING AND BEGAN
 RESEARCHING.
 THEY FOUND STORIES LINKING
 CANCERS IN PETS TO FOOD.
 COMPANIES FOCUSED ON COST
 EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTS MEETING
 ONLY BARE MINIMUM STANDARDS.
 NOTHING COMMERCIAL WAS GOING
 TO BE FED TO MY DOG EVER AGAIN
 Reporter: DOGS NEED WHAT'S
 KNOWN AS A COMPLETE AND BALANCED
 DIET, WITH MORE VITAMINS AND
 NUTRIENTS THAN THEY GET FROM
 HUMAN FOOD ALONE
 SO PADULSKY AND REGEV CREATED A
 MIX AND TESTED SAMPLES AT A LAB
 UNTIL THEY GOT THE FARMER'S DOG.
 LAUNCHING IN LATE SUMMER, 2014,
 IT'S FROZEN AND SHIPPED TO
 ARRIVE DAYS AFTER IT'S COOKED.
 THIS ONE'S TURKEY, BROCCOLI,
 PARSNIPS, CARROTS, AND THEN THE
 VITAMIN AND MINERAL MIX.
 Reporter: IT'S HUMAN GRADE
 WITH NO PRESERVATIVES, AND YES,
 THEY'VE BOTH EATEN IT.
 SOMEBODY WAS LIKE, WHEN WAS
 THE LAST TIME YOU ATE IT
 I WAS FEEDING JADA, AND I TOOK A
 BITE
 Reporter: DR. CARLY FOXX AT
 THE ANIMAL MEDICAL CENTER IN NEW
 YORK SAYS SHE USUALLY RECOMMENDS
 COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOOD AS
 LONG AS IT'S COMPLETE AND
 BALANCED
 SO IS FRESHLY MADE HUMAN FOOD
 BETTER
 SHE SAYS MAYBE
 IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR A PET TO
 EAT HUMAN-GRADE FOOD IF IT'S
 SOMETHING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO
 YOU AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT
 YOU'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO YOUR
 PET.
 I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU
 SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DISCUSS WITH
 YOUR VETERINARIAN.
 Reporter: COSTS DEPEND ON THE
 SIZE OF A DOG, AVERAGING ABOUT
 $29 A WEEK
 THE FARMER'S DOG HIT THE MARKET
 JUST AS AMERICAN SPENDING ON PET
 FOOD BEGAN TRENDING UP, ALMOST
 $30 BILLION IN 2018.
 UP MORE THAN 30% IN FOUR YEARS
 THIS IS NOT JUST A SICK DOG
 THING.
 THIS IS AN EVERY DOG THING
 WE WANTED A COMPANY WHOSE ENTIRE
 FOCUS WAS MAKING DOGS HEALTHY.
 AND BRET AND JONATHAN SAY
 THEY ARE NOW SHIPPING MORE THAN
 A MILLION MEALS A MONTH.
 WOW
 PRETTY GOOD BUSINESS, RIGHT
 THAT IS A BIG PICKUP.
 MORE THAN I WOULD HAVE
 ANTICIPATED WITH THAT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 HOW DO THEY KNOW WHAT KIND OF
 FRESH FOOD TO SHIP TO YOUR DOG
 WHAT YOU CAN DO, YOU GO ON
 THEIR WEBSITE AND YOU FILL OUT A
 QUESTIONNAIRE.
 AND IT ASKS YOU THINGS LIKE THE
 ACTIVITY LEVEL OF THE DOG, THE
 BREED OF THE DOG, ANY HEALTH
 CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE
 DOG.
 AND THEN THEY WILL CUSTOMIZE THE
 DIET FOR YOUR PARTICULAR PET
 I WONDER WHAT THEY'D DO FOR


 120-POUND DOG, MY AGE.
 PROBABLY BETTER EATING THAN I DO
 FOR MYSELF
 PEEP SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON
 PETS
 REGULAR COMMERCIAL DOG FOOD
 ISN'T THAT CHEAP ANYWAY.
 IT'S NOT COSTING YOU ALL THAT
 MUCH MORE IF -- IF AT ALL
 DEPENDING ON THE BREEDS OF YOUR
 DOG.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH
 GREAT TO SEE YOU
 YOU GOT IT.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
