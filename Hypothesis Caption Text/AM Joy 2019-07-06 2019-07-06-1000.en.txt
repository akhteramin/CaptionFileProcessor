 "A.M. JOY", LIVE FROM NEW ORLEANS.
 WELL, THIS WEEK ON AMERICA'S
 BIRTHDAY, KNOWN AS INDEPENDENCE
 DAY OR SIMPLY JULY 4, DONALD
 TRUMP THREW HIMSELF A PARTY.
 EVER SINCE HE SAW THAT THE
 FRENCH PRESIDENT HAS A PARADE,
 IT'S CALLED BASTILLE DAY AND THE
 DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA HAS A
 PARADE, IT'S CALLED
 AUTHORITARIANISM, AND THAT THEY
 GET TO HAVE TANKS AND PEOPLE
 MARCHING IN FRONT OF THEM AND
 SALUTING THEM, AND ALL OF THAT
 STUFF, HE'S WANTED TO HAVE ONE
 TOO.
 HE TRIED TO CO-OP OTHER HOLIDAYS
 LIKE VETERANS DAY AND MEMORIAL
 DAY, BUT THE ADULTS IN THE
 MILITARY KEPT PUSHING HIM BACK.
 NO MORE.
 DONALD TRUMP FINALLY GOT HIS
 SPECIAL DONALD TRUMP PARADE,
 ROLLING TANKS DOWN THE STREETS
 OF YOUR CAPITAL, FLYING AIR
 FORCE PLANES OVER HIS HEAD WHILE
 HE GAVE AN ODD SPEECH ABOUT THE
 AIRPORTS, THE CONTINENTAL
 CONGRESS TOOK CONTROL OF DURING
 THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR?
 IN JUNE OF 1775, THE
 CONTINENTAL CONGRESS CREATED A
 UNIFIED ARMY OUT OF THE
 REVOLUTIONARY FORCES ENCAMPED
 AROUND BOSTON AND NEW YORK.
 AND NAMED AFTER THE GREAT GEORGE
 WASHINGTON COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
 THE CONTINENTAL ARMY SUFFERED A
 BITTER WINTER OF VALLEY FORGE,
 FOUND GLORY ACROSS THE WATERS OF
 THE DELAWARE, AND SEIZED VICTORY
 FROM CORN WALLACE OF YORK TOWN.
 IT RAN THE RAMPARTS IT TOOK OVER
 THE AIRPORTS, IT DID EVERYTHING
 IT HAD TO DO AND AT FORT
 McHENDRY UNDER THE ROCKETS RED
 GLARE, IT HAD NOTHING BUT
 VICTORY.
 OKAY.
 I'M SURE YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY
 BECAUSE YOU PAID ATTENTION IN
 SCHOOL BUT JUST SO THAT IT'S
 SAID, THE CONTINENTAL ARMY WAS
 NOT NAMED AFTER GEORGE
 WASHINGTON.
 THERE WAS NO AIR TRAVEL DURING
 THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
 AIRPLANES WEREN'T EVEN INVENTED
 UNTIL 1903, AND THE BATTLE AT
 FORT McHENDRY HAPPENED DURING
 THE WAR OF 1812.
 DETAILS.
 IN THE END, FOR MILLIONS OF YOUR
 TAX DOLLARS, THIS IS ACTUALLY
 WHAT DONALD TRUMP GOT.
 ON THIS DAY, 243 YEARS AGO,
 OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PLEDGED
 THEIR LIVES, THEIR FORTUNES AND
 THEIR SACRED HONOR TO DECLARE
 INDEPENDENCE AND DEFEND OUR GOD
 GIVEN RIGHTS.
 NOT AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT BUT
 WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN AUTHORITARIAN
 LEADER, FESTOONED BY HIS
 MILITARY AND MAKING A SHOW OF
 FORCE TO, WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
 CLEAR WHO BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP
 ACTUALLY REALLY LIKES DICTATORS.
 JOINING ME NOW IS PRESIDENT O
 AND CEO OF LATINO.
 CRAIG UNGER, VANITY FAIR
 CONTRIBUTOR, AND AUTHOR OF HOUSE
 OF TRUMP, HOUSE OF PUTIN, AND
 REPRESENTATIVE TED LOU, DEMOCRAT
 FROM CALIFORNIA, AND A MEMBER OF
 THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEES.
 I WANT TO GO TO YOU FIRST,
 CONGRESSMAN, WHAT DID YOU MAKE
 OF IT, WATCHING AN AMERICAN
 PRESIDENT DO THIS THING THAT TOM
 NICHOLS, WHO IS A SOVIET, EXPERT
 ON THE HISTORY OF THE SOVIET
 UNION AND OF THAT REGION,
 DESCRIBED AS LOOKING LIKE AN OLD
 SOVIET KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
 PARADE.
 THANK YOU, JOY FOR YOUR
 QUESTION.
 LET ME JUST FIRST SAY THAT
 NATURAL DISASTER LIKE
 EARTHQUAKES CAN STRIKE AT ANY
 TIME AND I URGE TO BE PREPARED
 WITH SUPPLIES AND A SAFETY PLAN.
 TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, ONE OF
 THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH TRUMP'S
 JULY 4th EVENT IS IT WAS A
 CAMPAIGN EVENT PAID FOR BY THE
 AMERICAN TAXPAYER.
 NOT ONLY DID HE DIVERT MILLIONS
 OF DOLLARS TO THIS EVENT, HE HAD
 THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
 COMMITTEE GIVE OUT PASSES, VIP
 PASSES TO MAJOR DONORS.
 THAT WAS OUTRAGEOUS.
 THAT WAS A VIOLATION OF OUR

 ETHICS AND HE MADE A MOCKERY OF
 OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY.
 THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING
 WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR STATE.
 WE JUST SAW TWO NATURAL DISASTER
 IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, SO
 THIS IS A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY HAS
 PRIORITIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT
 THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MONEY
 ON, THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT
 STATES ARE READY FOR NATURAL
 DISASTER LIKE YOU JUST SAW IN
 YOUR STATE.
 WHEN YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT OF
 THE UNITED STATES DIVERTING
 MONEY SO HE CAN HAVE PLANES FLY
 OVER HIM, RATHER THAN SPENDING
 THE MONEY ON IMPORTANT THINGS
 LIKE THAT, OR MAYBE UNCAGING
 CHILDREN, WHICH HE'S ALSO DOING
 IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND
 ARIZONA AND OTHER PLACES, AS A
 MEMBER OF CONGRESS, IS THERE
 SOMETHING THAT YOU PLAN TO DO
 ABOUT THAT.
 THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A TREMENDOUS
 WASTE OF MONEY.
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CAN'T USE
 OFFICIAL RESOURCES TO
 PARTICIPATE IN A PARADE.
 IN THIS CASE, TRUMP DIVERTS
 $2.5 MILLION OF NATIONAL PARK
 FEES TO PAY FOR HIS PARTY, AND
 I'VE ASKED THE FEDERAL ELECTION
 COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THIS
 BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU HAVE ALL OF
 THIS TAXPAYER MONEY DO THIS
 EVENT AND HAVE THE REPUBLICAN
 NATIONAL COMMITTEE BE INVOLVED
 HANDING OUT VIP PASSES TO THE
 MAJOR DONORS.
 YEAH, AND BESIDES THAT, I
 WANT TO GO TO YOU CRAIG UNGER,
 YOU HAVE WRITTEN A LOT ABOUT
 DONALD TRUMP, HIS MAFIA SORT OF
 RELATIONSHIPS THAT HE HAS HAD
 THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER,
 PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO
 RUSSIA.
 THIS IS WHAT MICHAEL McFALL, THE
 FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA
 TWEETED AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S
 WEIRD PARADE.
 HE SAID I KNEW THIS WAS COMING,
 TWEET FROM JULIA DAVIS NEWS,
 RUSSIA STATE TV IS OBSESSIVELY
 BASHING TRUMP'S LOW ENERGY WEAK
 PARADE WITH RUSTY TANKS, THE
 HOSTS LOL AT TRUMP'S CLAIM'S,
 THERE'S YOUR CITY UPON A HILL, A
 WORLD LEADER AND MARTIANS HAVE
 BEEN DEFEATED.
 DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY WASTED
 AMERICA'S MONEY TO MAKE HIMSELF
 A CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL BUT ALSO
 HAS SUBJECTED THE UNITED STATES
 TO MOCKERY BECAUSE REAL
 DICTATORSHIPS KNOW WHAT A
 DICTATOR PARADE IS SUPPOSED TO
 LOOK LIKE, CRAIG.
 AT LEAST SOMETIMES THEY GET
 THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT, AND I
 MEAN, IT'S INTERESTING THAT IF
 THE RUSSIAN STATE TV IS GOING
 AFTER TRUMP, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
 WITHOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S SAY SO.
 IT'S ALSO INTERESTING, THE CLIP
 YOU SHOWED, THE NUMBER OF
 HISTORICAL ERRORS IN IT IS JUST
 EXTRAORDINARY, AND THE WHITE
 HOUSE HAS AN OFFICE OF SPEECH
 WRITING WITH LOTS OF RESEARCHERS
 AND INTERNS AND THEY FACT CHECK
 THINGS, AND THERE ARE ONLY THREE
 POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT LEVEL OF
 STUPIDITY TO TAKE PLACE.
 ONE IS THAT THAT OFFICE IS
 COMPLETELY FILLED WITH PEOPLE
 WITH ROOM TEMPERATURE IQ, THE
 OTHER IS THAT ALL THE PROCEDURES
 HAVE FALLEN APART, AND THEY
 DON'T EXIST ANYMORE, AND THE
 THIRD POSSIBILITY IS IT'S
 SPRAYING FROM THE BRAIN OF
 DONALD TRUMP, AND THAT IS
 DEEPLY, DEEPLY DISTURBING.
 YEAH, THERE'S A LOT ABOUT IT
 THAT'S DISTURBING LONNIE, I'M
 GOING TO GO TO YOU ON THIS, I'M
 GLAD YOU'RE HERE TO HAVE A
 HISTORICAL CONTEXT.
 DONALD TRUMP ADMIRES DICTATOR

 SHIPS AROUND THE WORLD.
 ALL OF THE MEDIA IS HIS VERSION
 OF THE BASTILLE DAY CEREMONY.
 I POINTED OUT EARLIER THIS WEEK,
 THE WHOLE BASTILLE DAY THING IS
 ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE TO
 DICTATORS.
 THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE BASTILLE
 DAY IS ABOUT.
 THAT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT THIS IS.
 DONALD TRUMP LIKES DICTATORS.
 WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT YOU
 THINK CAME OUT OF WHAT DONALD
 TRUMP DID THIS WEEK?
 IT WAS GRANDIOSITY AND
 SELF-INFLATION, AND SO ONE OF
 THE THINGS, I THINK, THAT'S
 SIGNIFICANT HERE IS THAT THE
 UNITED STATES, AT LEAST IN
 THEORY, IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE
 ON THE DOCTRINE THAT WE ARE A
 NATION OF LAWS, THAT NO ONE IS
 ABOVE THE LAW, AND THAT THE
 CONSTITUTION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL
 AUTHORITY.
 THAT IS A DIFFERENT POSITION,
 FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT POSITION
 THAN A STATE IN WHICH THE
 PERSONALITY OR THE AUTHORITARIAN
 LEADER IS THE HEAD OF ALL
 INTEREST AND IDEAS WITHIN THE
 STATE, AND SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP
 DID WAS ESSENTIALLY HIJACK THIS
 IDEA AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING
 THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GLORIFY
 ITSELF.
 IT'S AN INTERESTING PARADOX
 HERE, WHICH IS THAT SEVERAL
 YEARS AGO, I DID A FULL BRIGHT
 FELLOWSHIP AND SPENT AN ENTIRE
 SEMESTER IN MOSCOW, TEACHING AT
 MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY AND AT
 THE END OF THE SEMESTER, THERE
 WAS THE MAY 9th CELEBRATION.
 ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN TO RUSSIA
 OR KNOWS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT THEIR
 HISTORY POST WORLD WAR II, MAY
 9th IS A GIGANTIC CELEBRATION
 THAT HAPPENS EACH YEAR SOMEWHERE
 BETWEEN THE FOURTH OF JULY AND
 NEW YEAR'S AND IT IS A
 RECOGNITION OF THE SOVIET DEFEAT
 OF THE NAZI THREAT, AN THREAT IN

 WORLD WAR II.
 IT'S HUGE.
 I WAS THERE FOR THE PARADE AND
 THERE'S THIS COMPLETE PROCESSION
 OF MILITARY VEHICLES.
 THEIR MISSILES, TANKS, ARMORED
 VEHICLES, THEIR JEEPS AND IT
 LOOKS LIKE AN ARMY AMASSING FOR
 AN INVASION.
 SOMEONE TURNS TO ME AND SAYS DO
 YOU DO THE SAME THING IN THE
 UNITED STATES ON THE FOURTH OF
 JULY.
 I SAID, NO, THIS WOULD NEVER
 HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES
 BECAUSE THEY, IN THE UNITED
 STATES BELIEVER THERE SHOULD BE
 A REALLY CLEAR DISTINCTION
 BETWEEN CIVILIAN AUTHORITY AND
 MILITARY MIGHT AND THAT OUR
 AUTHORITY IS SUPPOSED TO, AT
 LEAST IN THEORY, STEM FROM OUR
 LAWS AND OUR MORAL BELIEVES.
 AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS
 ESSENTIALLY INVERT THAT TO
 CREATE IT AS THE KIND OF
 SATIRICAL, ALMOST, EMULATION OF
 SOMETHING THAT HE SEES IN
 VLADIMIR PUTIN, WE SHOULD
 RECOGNIZE THIS AS THE
 ANTIDEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT THAT IT
 ACTUALLY WAS.
 YEAH, I MEAN, THAT IS AN
 EXCELLENT POINT.
 HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT
 TRUMP TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK
 BIG FROM THIS PIECE.
 IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING
 THAT INDEPENDENCE MEANT NOTHING
 MORE THAN A MADE FOR TELEVISION
 EVENT AND AN EGO MESSAGE.
 IT INVOKED MOCKERY.
 THERE'S A CARTOON THAT'S DRAWN
 ON WHAT AIRPLANES WOULD LOOK
 LIKE DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY
 WAR.
 IT'S BEN FRANKLIN ATTACHED TO
 TWO KITES AND THIS IS BY
 SOMEBODY I KNOW, THE GREAT
 NATALIE JOHNSON WHO DREW THAT.
 HERE'S THE REALITY, DONALD TRUMP
 IT SEEMS WANTS TO BE SEEN AS
 THIS BIG MAN, RIGHT, HE WANTS TO
 BE SEEN AS THIS GRAND LEADER OF
 THIS GREAT MILITARY BUT WHAT HE
 ACTUALLY CAN ACCOMPLISH THROUGH
 HIS OWN, YOU KNOW, THE QUALITY
 OF THE STAFF THAT HE HAS AROUND
 HIM IS HE CAN'T DO THAT.
 THE REALITY IS EVEN IN THE CASE
 OF RUSSIA, WHICH NOW IS AN
 ADVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES,
 DURING WORLD WAR II, THEY WERE
 FIGHTING THE NAZIS.
 IF THEY'RE DOING A BIG
 CELEBRATION, TALKING ABOUT
 DEFEATING THE NAZI EMPIRE,
 THEY'RE SENDING A MESSAGE AGAIN
 TO DICTATORS.
 THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PARADES,
 THAT AND ONE IN NORTH KOREA.
 TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO IT.
 HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW.
 OR REALLY WHY.
 WE ARE THE LARGEST MILITARY
 OPERATION IN THE WORLD.
 WE DON'T HAVE TO SHOW THAT TYPE
 OF DISPLAY OF FORCE BECAUSE THE
 WORLD ALREADY KNOWS IT AND WHAT
 I FOUND SO DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT
 CAME TO JULY 4th IS JULY 4th IS
 TO COMMEMORATE OUR ROOTS AS
 AMERICANS, THE FACT THAT WE FLED
 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HERE, AND
 RECOGNIZE THAT, OUR DNA IS WE'RE
 A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE
 HAVE STRENGTH AND DON'T HAVE TO
 SHOW MILITARY MIGHT BECAUSE THE
 WORLD KNOWS IT, AND WHAT DONALD
 TRUMP DID WAS A SAD DISPLAY.
 HE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO
 JOIN THE MILITARY WHEN HIS CARD
 WAS UP.
 HE DEFERRED IT ON BONE SPURS AND
 BASICALLY NOT ONLY DETERIORATES
 THE FLAG BUT ALSO THE MEANING OF
 WHAT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN AND
 JULY 4th AND COME TOGETHER AS A
 NATION.
 THE REASONS PRESIDENTS DON'T
 MAKE IT ABOUT THEM IS BECAUSE
 IT'S ONE COUNTRY, UNDER ONE FLAG
 IN UNISON.
 IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
 PARTISAN.
 HE CREATED A CAMPAIGN RALLY,
 TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE US AND
 DIVIDE US.
 WHAT I THINK IS BEAUTIFUL IS YOU
 SAW FAMILIES ON THE LAWN SAYING
 I'M APOLITICAL AND I'M HERE TO

 SHARE IT WITH FAMILIES.
 WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE.
 WE KNOW WHO WE ARE, AND WE KNOW
 WE DO IT WITH JUSTICE.
 THE FACT THAT HE CAN DO THIS IN
 THE BACKDROP OF CAGING CHILDREN,
 THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE.
 AND THE MORE WE CAN STAND STRONG
 TO VALUES, DESPITE THE OPERATION
 IN OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE TO MAKE
 SURE THAT WE ARE CLEAR MINDED ON
 WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN AND
 FAIR AND JUST.
 DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT YOU
 SAW, DONALD TRUMP MADE US LOOK
 STRONGER AND WEAKER AS A
 COUNTRY.
 ABSOLUTELY WEAKER.
 THE WORST PART OF IT IS THAT HAD
 THIS NOT BEEN AN INEPT DISPLAY
 OF PSEUDO AUTHORITARIANISM, WE
 STILL WOULD HAVE LOOKED WEAKER.
 IF HE HAD DOWN THIS CORRECTLY,
 IN AIR QUOTES CORRECTLY, WE
 WOULD HAVE LOOKED WEAKER.
 NOW WE LOOK DOUBLY WEAKER,
 BECAUSE IT'S A POOR IMITATION OF
 WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN
 THE FIRST PLACE.
 WHEN THE RUSSIANS LOOK AT US,
 THEY ARE LAUGHING AT US.
 IS HE A SUBJECT OF MOCKERY TO
 THEM.
 I THINK HE IS SUBJECT TO
 MOCKERY, THE IMAGES THAT COME
 AWAY IS WE HAVE CONCENTRATION
 CAMPS ON THE BORDER, TANKS BY
 THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
 THERE WAS AN PIECE TO THE
 "WASHINGTON POST," THE
 ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT
 RECONCILIATION, IT'S ABOUT THE
 LINCOLN MEMORIAL, OUR ORIGINAL
 SIN WAS SLAVERY.
 THE CIVIL WAR, AND THIS IS WHERE
 WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
 RECONCILIATION, AND INSTEAD
 TODAY WE HAVE IMAGES OF TANKS
 AND THE WHOLE CRISIS AT THE
 BORDER.
 I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE
 LAST WORD, CONGRESSMAN.
 AS A PERSON WHO DID SERVE,
 UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHEN YOU
 SAW TANKS ROLLING DOWN THE
 NATION'S CAPITOL, YOUR THOUGHTS
 WERE WHAT?
 HAVING SERVED IN THE ACTIVE
 DUTY IN THE MILITARY, WE HAVE
 BEEN TRAINED NOT TO PARTICIPATE
 IN PARTISAN CAMPAIGN EVENTS.
 THERE'S A DIRECTIVE THAT
 PROHIBITS MILITARY MEMBERS FROM
 SHOWING UP IN UNIFORM AT A
 CAMPAIGN RALLY.
 THIS WAS A MASSIVE TAX FUNDED
 CAMPAIGN RALLY, HANDING OUT VIP
 PASSES, IT ERODED WHAT SHOULD BE
 A NONPARTISAN MILITARY AND THAT
 WAS SAD AND DISAPPOINTING.
 THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE
 AND SENDING OUT GOOD THOUGHTS TO
 YOUR STATE CONGRESSMAN, JILANI

 COBB, CRAIG UNGER, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 PEOPLE LOCKED IN CAGES ON
 THE SOUTHERN BOARD, MORE ON THAT
 NEXT.
       CAGES ON THE SOUTHERN BOARD, MORE ON THAT
 NEXT
  Coach! It's kinda hard to see  the ball.
        I've been there.
  I had a TV service with hardly  any sports in 4K.
 Couldn't see any of the quality details.
 I switched to DIRECTV, now I get the most live sports in 4K.
    So how does that help me?
       It really doesn't.
   I don't know why I told you   that. Go get 'em sport!
  <i> Live sports that aren't in 4K</i>  <i> are just kinda TV.</i>
   <i> Don't just kinda TV. DIRECTV</i>
  <i> Don't have 4K? Call</i>  <i> 1.855.WATCH.4K and ask for it</i>  <i> today.</i>
 UNCONSCIONABLE. NO CHILD SHOULD EVER BE
 SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENT.
 THE MOTHERS, THE ABUELAS, THE
 TIAS, THE MADRES, WHO I SAT WITH
 WHO WE WANT OPENLY IN OUR ARMS.
 I'LL NEVER FORGET THE IMAGE
 OF BEING IN A CELL AND SEEING 15
 WOMEN TEARS COMING DOWN THEIR
 FACES AS THEY TALKED ABOUT BEING
 SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN,
 ABOUT HAVING NO RUNNING WATER.
 IN FACT, ONE OF THE WOMEN
 SAID THAT SHE WAS TOLD BY AN
 AGENT TO DRINK WATER OUT OF THE
 TOILET.
 THIS WEEK DEMOCRATIC
 LAWMAKERS ONCE AGAIN SAW FOR
 THEMSELVES THE SHAMEFUL
 CONDITIONS THAT MIGRANT CHILDREN
 AND ADULTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO
 LIVE, SPECIFICALLY AT A
 DETENTION FACILITY IN CLINT,
 TEXAS.
 CONDITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
 HOMELAND SECURITY'S INSPECTOR
 GENERAL CONFIRMED IN A REPORT
 THIS WEEK.
 LET ME READ TO YOU SOME OF THE
 FINDINGS, QUOTE, CHILDREN AT
 THREE OF THE FIVE BORDER PATROL
 FACILITIES THAT WE VISITED HAD
 NO ACCESS TO SHOWERS.
 AT THESE FACILITIES CHILDREN HAD
 LIMITED ACCESS TO A CHANGE OF
 CLOTHES, BORDER PATROL HAD FEW
 SPARE CLOTHES AND LAUNDRY
 FACILITIES WHILE ALL FACILITIES
 HAD INFANT FORMULA, DIAPERS,
 BABY WIPES, JUICE AND SNACKS FOR
 CHILDREN, TWO FACILITIES HAD NOT
 PROVIDED CHILDREN ACCESS TO HOT
 MEALS.
 BUT CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL
 WAS SO DESPERATE TO DISPEL THESE
 FIRSTHAND ACCOUNTS FROM
 LAWMAKERS AND ACTIVISTS THAT ONE
 OF IT CHIEFS FILMED A VIDEO
 SHOWING A SUPPLY ROOM WITH AN
 ABUNDANCE OF CLOTHING AND
 SUPPLIES, AND A CLEAN AREA, 300
 MILES AWAY IN ARIZONA.
 BACK WITH ME, MARIA THERESA
 KUMAR, AND ANDREA PITZER AUTHOR
 OF ONE LONG NIGHT.
 AND LAURA, DIRECTOR OF
 IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS AT COLUMBIA
 LAW SCHOOL AND A LAWYER WHO HAS
 VISITED DETENTION CENTERS FOR
 THE LAST 10 YEARS.
 LAURA, I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU A
 LITTLE BIT, A VIDEO THAT WAS
 OBTAINED OF A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
 A 12-YEAR-OLD MIGRANT, HER
 ACCOUNT OF BEING DETAINED FOR
 TWO WEEKS.
 IT'S IN SPANISH FOR THOSE OF YOU
 WHO ARE WATCHING.
 YOU'LL HAVE TO READ THE SUB
 TITLES.
 [ SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ]

 AND LAURA, WE HAVE HEARD STORIES OF LITTLE KIDS BEING FORCED TO
 TAKE CARE OF OTHER LITTLE KIDS.
 CHILDREN SLEEPING ON THE GROUND
 IN NOTHING BUT A DIAPER.
 CHILDREN SAYING THEY HAVE ONE
 MEAL A DAY.
 IS THIS LEGAL?
 NO, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT
 LEGAL.
 FEDERAL LAW PROVIDES FOR
 PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN IN
 FEDERAL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY.
 THE 1997 FLORES SETTLEMENT
 AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SAFE
 AND SANITARY CONDITIONS FOR
 CHILDREN IN ITS CUSTODY.
 A LAW FROM 2008 WHICH WAS PASSED
 WITH UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN
 SUPPORT AND SIGNED BY PRESIDENT
 GEORGE W. BUSH SAYS THAT
 CHILDREN MUST NOT BE DETAINED BY
 CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL FOR
 ANY LONGER THAN 72 HOURS.
 THE CONDITIONS THAT WE'RE
 LEARNING ABOUT, WHAT WE HEAR,
 WHAT I SMELLED WHEN I WAS AT
 THESE FACILITIES, IT IS
 UNLAWFUL, AND ILLEGAL.
 AND THEN, LAURA, THIS IS WHAT
 I HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD AND I'M
 GOING TO GO TO YOU FIRST, AND
 THEN MARIA THERESA KUMAR BECAUSE
 WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHY
 THEY MIGHT BE DOING THIS.
 THEY'RE HOLDING KIDS FOR 50
 DAYS, 40 DAYS, 30 DAYS, ALMOST
 AS IF THE RANSOM, THEY CAN'T
 LEAVE.
 HOW CAN THEY GET AWAY WITH IT IF
 IT'S ILLEGAL.
 IT IS ILLEGAL AND WHAT'S
 IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT MOST
 OF THESE CHILDREN HAVE FAMILY
 MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO
 ARE DESPERATE TO HAVE THEIR
 CHILDREN BACK.
 80% OF CHILDREN RELEASED FROM
 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE
 HOUSED AND CARED FOR AND LOVED
 FOR BY THEIR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS.
 WE NEED IMMEDIATE CONGRESSIONAL
 OVERSIGHT AND PRESSURE ON THIS
 ADMINISTRATION TO RELEASE
 CHILDREN FROM DETENTION AS
 QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND WHILE
 CHILDREN ARE DETAINED THEY MUST
 BE TREATED HUMANELY.
 YOU KNOW, MARIA THERESA
 KUMAR, I HAVE TO GO TO YOU ON
 THIS.
 WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE.
 YOU HAVE BEEN THERE MUCH MORE
 THAN I HAVE.
 LAURA HAS BEEN THERE.
 I'M NOT A LAWYER.
 IT STRIKES ME AS COMPLETELY
 ILLEGAL TO HOLD CHILDREN IN THIS
 MANNER WHEN AS LAURA SAID, THEY
 HAVE FAMILY TO GO TO.
 DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT'S CATCH
 AND RELEASE, HE'S NOT DOING IT.
 WHY IN YOUR VIEW ARE THEY
 HOLDING THESE CHILDREN?
 IS IT THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE
 MAKING, I MEAN IT'S 750 BUCKS A
 DAY TO HOLD KIDS IN THESE CAMPS.
 IS IT STRAIGHT MONEY, WHY ARE
 THEY NOT LETTING THEM GO?
 I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF
 THINGS.
 ONE, IT'S POLITICAL FODDER, IT
 SHOWS THAT HE IS THE STRONG
 FISTED PERSON MAKING SURE
 THEY'RE TRYING TO USE THIS AS A
 DETERRENT.
 HE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THIS.
 IT'S STEVE MILLER, HIS SENIOR
 ADVISER WITH HIS FINGER PRINTS
 ALL OVER IT.
 IT'S POLITICAL FODDER FOR HIS
 BASE.
 HE'S BEING TOUGH AND IT'S THE
 PARENTS' FAULT HE CAME HERE.
 TWO, THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO
 BE MAID.
 THE PRIVATE DETENTION
 FACILITIES, THE FOR PROFIT
 DETENTION FACILITIES, STOCK
 PRICES WENT ON THE RISE.
 THE CHIEF OF STAFF, THE FORMER
 CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY WHO
 ADVISED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WAS
 HEAD OF THE DHS, HE WAS ONE OF
 THE ARCHITECTURES OF THIS.
 GUESS WHERE JOHN KELLY IS NOW.
 HE IS NOW ON THE BOARD OF
 ADVISERS TO ONE OF THE LARGEST
 DETENTION FOR PROFIT FACILITIES.
 HE HAS GONE DOWN TO HOMESTEAD,
 IN FLORIDA, HOUSING 3,200
 MINORS.
 PRESIDENT OBAMA PROCESSED
 INDIVIDUALS AND DEPORTED THEM.
 THIS PRESIDENT HAS LITTLE
 INTENTION OF DEPORTING THEM.
 THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT SUPPOSED
 TO BE IN CUSTODY MORE THAN 72
 DAYS.
 IN SOME CASES, THEY ARE THERE
 FOR MONTHS, IN SOME CASES,
 ALMOST A YEAR, AND IT'S CLEAR
 THE ONLY WAY YOU DO IT IS ENSURE
 SOMEONE IS MAKING A LOT OF
 PROFIT, AND YOU DO IT AWAY FROM
 THE CAMERAS, AWAY FROM THE
 AMERICAN PUBLIC AND YOU DO IT
 ALMOST IN SECRET.
 THE FACT THAT THIS IS BASICALLY,
 YOU HAVE SOME I.C.E. AGENTS
 COMING OUT AND ANONYMOUSLY
 SHOWING PICTURES OF WHAT IS
 HAPPENING IN THE FACILITIES.
 THEY'RE TRYING TO ALSO, YOU
 KNOW, RING THE RED LIGHT OF THIS
 IS NOT NORMAL.
 THIS IS ILLEGAL, AND WE NEED THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE TO STAND UP FOR
 IT.
 THE FACT THAT THE UNITED NATIONS
 HAVE DECLARED THAT THE UNITED
 STATES IS IN VIOLATION OF
 CHILDREN'S HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD
 BE SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THE
 LUNGS OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN
 SAYING THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.
 THIS IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY STAND
 FOR.
 ANDREA, I MEAN, WE HAVE HAD A
 WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE GETTING
 UPSET AND DEBATING OVER WHAT YOU
 CALL THESE CAMPS.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU WOULD
 CALL IT OTHER THAN CONCENTRATION
 CAMPS.
 THEY WON'T LET THEM GO, SEEM TO
 BE DISPLAYING MISERY TO
 ENTERTAIN.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY'RE
 TRYING TO SHOW THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE.
 THEY SEEM TO WANT US TO KNOW
 THEY'RE DOING THIS TO THESE
 KIDS.
 WE HAD A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS
 ALLEGEDLY SHAMED.
 THIS ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY
 HUNG A SIGN ON HIM, SAYING I
 LIKE MEN IN SPANISH AND PUT A
 SIGN ON HIM TO TRY TO HUMILIATE
 HIM.
 THIS REMINDS ME OF THE WAY WE
 BEHAVED AT ABU GRAVE WHERE IT
 WAS TRYING TO DISPLAY THE
 MOCKERY OF THESE PEOPLE.
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING
 ON HERE AND NO ONE IS STOPPING
 IT.
 YOUR THOUGHTS, ANDREA.
 LOOK, IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT
 THERE ARE ECHOES OF PRIOR CAMP
 SYSTEMS IN GOING BACK MORE THAN
 A HUNDRED YEARS IN WHAT WE'RE
 SEEING ON THE BORDER TODAY.
 THE TURN OF THE 20th CENTURY,
 EMILY HOB HOUSE WENT DOWN TO
 SOUTHERN AFRICA AND WERE SHOCKED
 THAT THE BRITISH WEREN'T
 PROVIDING SOAP TO CHILDREN AND
 WOMEN IN DETENTION SO THEY COULD
 PREVENT CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.
 TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
 WOULD DIE IN THOSE CAMPS WHILE

 PARLIAMENT ARGUED OVER WHETHER
 IT WAS FAIR TO CALL THEM
 CONCENTRATION CAMPS.
 IN GERMANY, A MAN WAS ARRESTED
 AND TAKEN WHERE NAZIS PUT A SIGN
 AROUND HIM TO HUMILIATE HIM.
 ARGUMENTS OVER WHAT TO CALL IT,
 DEATH FROM CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.
 WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT A DEATH CAMP
 SYSTEM LIKE AUSCHWITZ BUT IT IS
 A CONCENTRATION CAMP SYSTEM, A
 MALEVOLENT SYSTEM THAT HAS DEEP
 ROOTS IN A POLARIZED SOCIETY
 THAT IS WILLING TO DO HARM TO
 VULNERABLE PEOPLE.
 IF THE AUTHORITIES DON'T
 INTERVENE, WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING
 TO THAT HAPPEN, WE'LL MOVE TO
 THE NEXT STAGE OF CONCENTRATION
 CAMP ABUSES, WHICH ARE GOING TO
 SHOW UP NOT AS NEGLIGENCE BUT
 ATROCITIES.
 I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO
 PLEASE COME BACK.
 CAN I ADD SOMETHING.
 VERY QUICKLY.
 SO, JOY, I THINK THE BIGGER
 ISSUE, TOO, IS THAT WE KNOW THAT
 A LOT OF THESE FOLKS THAT ARE
 GETTING THESE GOVERNMENT
 CONTRACTS ACTUALLY SERVED AS
 SECURITY GUARDS FOR AFGHANISTAN
 AND IRAQ.
 THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING
 SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN.
 YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
 I WANT TO HAVE YOU GUYS COME
 BACK.
 WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
 THESE CHILDREN CAN DO.
 WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
 NEXT.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MARIA
 THERESA KUMAR, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH ALL THREE.
 LATER THIS HOUR, WE'RE GOING

 TO TALK ABOUT DISTURBING
 INFORMATION, ABOUT THE CULTURE
 AT THE BORDER PROTECTION AGENCY.
 PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR THAT.
 COMING UP NEXT, EVEN AFTER HE
 WAS SLAPPED BY THE SUPREME
 COURT, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT
 GIVING UP ON HIS ATTEMPTS TO RIG
 THE CENSUS.
 JUST GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
 AND BETTER.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
                     ETTER AND BR AND BETTER
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
      It would mean the world             to them,
      <i> and they will love you</i>             <i> forever.</i>
 OFFICIALS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE ASSESSING THE
 DAMAGE AFTER THE SECOND POWERFUL
 EARTHQUAKE IN THE REGION IN JUST
 THE LAST TWO DAYS.
 FRIDAY'S QUAKE HAD A MAGNITUDE
 OF 7.1 AND WAS CENTERED IN THE
 DESERT CITY OF RIDGECREST, FELT
 IN LOS ANGELES AND LAS VEGAS.
 IT RATTLED HOMES AND BUSINESSES
 AND SPARKED FIRE AND POWER
 OUTAGES.
 AT A BASEBALL GAME BETWEEN THE
 LOS ANGELES DODGERS AND SAN
 DIEGO PADRES, DODGERS STADIUM
 SEEMED TO SHAKE AND ROLL FOR
 NEARLY A MINUTE, BUT THE PLAYERS
 PLAYED ON.
 FRIDAY'S QUAKE COMES ONE DAY OF
 A 6.4 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE IN
 THE SAME REGION.
 OFFICIALS SAY THERE WILL LIKELY
 BE MORE.
 STAY WITH MSNBC THROUGHOUT THE
 DAY FOR THE LATEST ON THIS
 STORY.
 UP NEXT ON A.M. JOY, TRUMP AND
 HIS FAR RIGHT ALLIES WANT TO RIG
 THE CENSUS BUT SINCE HE'S DONALD
 TRUMP, HE MAY HAVE ALREADY
 TANKED HIS OWN CASE.
                     VE ALREADY TANKED HIS OWN CASE.
    With New Nicorette Coated            Ice Mint.
      Layered with flavor...
  It's the first and only coated        nicotine lozenge.
     For an amazing taste...
  ...that outlasts your craving.
     New Nicorette Ice Mint.
 THE CENSUS IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED
 OPERATION THAT WE ARE REQUIRED
 TO IMPLEMENT EVERY TEN YEARS.
 IT IS ONE OF THE MOST VITAL AND
 SENSITIVE THINGS THAT WE DO IN
 OUR GOVERNMENT.
 I WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS QUESTION
 WAS MAGICALLY ADDED AFTER WE
 HAVE SEEN THAT A POLITICAL
 OPERATIVE KNEW AND DETAILED AN
 INTENT TO INTIMIDATE RACIAL AND
 IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES FOR A
 PARTISAN PURPOSE?
 A RECENT SUPREME COURT
 DECISION LAST MONTH IN WHICH
 CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SIDED
 WITH THE LIBERALS ON THE COURT
 MADE IT CLEAR THE MAJORITY ON
 THE COURT SAW THROUGH THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION'S ATTEMPTS TO RIG
 THE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED
 UNITED STATES CENSUS TO TRY AND
 TAKE MONEY AND RESOURCES AWAY
 FROM NONWHITE PEOPLE AND
 IMMIGRANTS.
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S
 ATTEMPTS TO PRETEND THAT THEY
 REALLY WANTED TO ADD A
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE
 CENSUS TO HELP THEM ENFORCE THE
 VOTING RIGHTS ACT WERE EASILY
 SEEN RIGHT THROUGH.
 THE CAREER LAWYERS AT THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SEEMED
 CONTENT TO LISTEN TO THE COURT.
 APPARENTLY DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT.
 AFTER GOING ON A TWITTER TIRADE,
 APPARENTLY AFTER CONOODLING WITH
 HIS ALLIES, HE ORDERED THE DOJ
 TO TRY AGAIN.
 ON FRIDAY, TRUMP INVENTED A NEW
 POWER THAT HE THINKS HE HAS AS
 PRESIDENT SAYING HE'S
 CONSIDERING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
 TO FORCE THE CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION ON TO CENSUS.
 WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING
 THAT.
 IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS.
 WE HAVE FOUR OR FIVE WAYS WE CAN

 DO IT.
 WE CAN ALSO ADD AN ADDITION ON.
 WE CAN START THE PRINTING ON AND
 MAYBE DO AN ADDENDUM AFTER WE
 GET A POSITIVE DECISION SO WE'RE
 WORKING ON A LOT OF THINGS,
 INCLUDING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.
 IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING,
 YOU CANNOT OVERRULE A SUPREME
 COURT DECISION WITH AN EXECUTIVE
 ORDER.
 JOINING ME NOW IS MSNBC LEGAL
 ANALYST, MAYA WILEY, ADAM
 SERWER
 OF THE ATLANTIC.
 CAN ONE OVERRULE THE SUPREME
 COURT DECISION BY HAVING AN
 EXECUTIVE ORDER.
 NO.
 SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
 QUESTION.
 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.
 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT
 CLEAR.
 I THINK WHAT'S REALLY
 IMPORTANT HERE, IS JUSTICE
 ROBERTS IN HIS OPINION SAID THAT
 JUDICIAL REVIEW IS NOT JUST AN
 EMPTY VEHICLE, THAT IT HAS TO
 HAVE MEANING.
 HE WAS EXPLICIT IN THE OPINION.
 THINK ABOUT THIS, A CHIEF
 JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
 FELT THE NEED TO SAY THAT IN AN
 OPINION.
 THAT IS ASTOUNDING AND DONALD
 TRUMP HAS PROVEN WHY IT WAS
 NECESSARY TO SAY.
 YOU KNOW, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
 LAWYERS RIGHT NOW ARE TRYING TO
 FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO WHAT THEY
 HAVE AN OATH TO DO, WHICH IS
 UPHOLD THE LAWS OF THE UNITED
 STATES AND THERE IS NO HIGHER
 LEGAL VEHICLE IN THE LAND IN
 TERMS OF HOW TO UNDERSTAND OUR
 CONSTITUTION OR INTERPRET OUR
 STAFF STATUTES THAN THE SUPREME
 COURT.
 THE STORY THAT'S DEVELOPING
 IS DONALD TRUMP GETS SLAPPED
 DOWN BY THE SUPREME COURT, THEN
 WITH HIS FRIENDS ON THE FAR
 RIGHT, THE ALT-RIGHT, FOLKS LIKE
 STEPHEN BANNON, WHOEVER HE WAS
 TALKING TO.
 HE GETS MAD, DOES THIS TWEET
 FORM, THAT IT'S FAKE, THEY'RE
 NOT GOING TO FIGHT TO GET THE
 QUESTION ON THE CENSUS, WHICH IS
 JUST A STRAIGHT OUT LIE, AND NOW
 YOU HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF
 JUSTICE TWISTING ITSELF INTO
 KNOTS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
 TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD
 TO DO WHICH IS TO STILL FIND A
 WAY TO GET THIS ISSUE ON TO THE
 CENSUS.
 WE KNOW FROM THE REPORTING
 THAT'S OUT THERE IS THE ORIGINAL
 REASON FOR IT IS THAT THEY
 WANTED TO DEFUND AREAS THAT HAD
 A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS IN IT,
 ESPECIALLY NON-WHITE IMMIGRANTS.
 THEY WANT TO GIVE WHITE VOTERS
 AN ADVANTAGE, KNOWING
 6.5 MILLION PEOPLE WOULDN'T
 ANSWER THE CENSUS.
 THE FACT THAT THEY'RE MAKING IT
 THIS BLATANT, YOUR THOUGHTS.
 I WANT TO SAY ONE THING, THIS
 IS NOT A QUESTION OF FAR RIGHT.
 THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN
 ESTABLISHMENT THAT HATCHED THIS
 SCHEME FOR WEAKENING THE VOTING
 INFLUENCE OF VOTERS OF COLOR TO
 INCREASE WHITE VOTING POWER.
 THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY
 ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN SCHEME
 THAT DONALD TRUMP RECOGNIZES IS
 IMPORTANT IF THE REPUBLICAN
 PARTY WANTS TO KEEP WINNING
 ELECTIONS IN A DIVERSIFYING
 COUNTRY.
 THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO
 MAKE WHITE VOTES COUNT MORE, AND
 WHEN THEY WENT TO THE SUPREME
 COURT, THEY GAVE THEM A
 FICTIONAL REASON AND OF ALL THE
 CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ON THE
 SUPREME COURT, ONLY ROBERTS WAS
 WILLING TO SAY IT WAS FICTIONAL.
 THE OTHER SUPREME COURT JUSTICES
 SAID THAT THE PLAINTIFFS WERE
 ASKING LIKE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS
 IN SUGGESTING THE COMMERCE
 SECRETARY WAS LYING.
 NOW THE PRESIDENT HAS CONFIRMED
 IT, THIS IS ABOUT DISTRICTING,
 THIS IS ABOUT DILUTING THE
 MINORITY VOTE.
 THIS IS NOT ABOUT ENFORCING THE
 MINORITY RIGHTS ACT.
 EVERYONE KNEW THAT WAS A
 PRETEXT, BUT WHAT THEY TRIED TO
 DO WAS NOT SIMPLY LIE TO THE
 COURT, NOT SIMPLY LIE TO THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT TELL THEM
 THE THING THAT THEY WERE SEEING
 IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES WAS
 FALSE.
 YEAH, AND JUST TO SHOW YOU
 ALL THAT, YOU KNOW -- AND THANK
 YOU FOR MAKING THAT POINT
 BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A
 LONG-TERM THING TRYING TO GAME
 AND GAME AND GAME THE SYSTEM
 BECAUSE THEY KNOW DEMOGRAPHICS
 ARE CHANGING AND THEY DON'T WANT
 IT TO CHANGE THEIR POWER.
 LET ME PLAY THE DONALD TRUMP
 SOUND BITE, WHERE DONALD TRUMP
 ADMITS IT'S ABOUT DISTRICTING,
 USING THE CENSUS TO INCREASE THE
 POWER OF HIS SIDE.
 YOU NEED IT FOR MANY REASONS.
 YOU NEED IT FOR CONGRESS, FOR
 DISTRICTING.
 YOU NEED IT FOR APPROPRIATION,
 WHERE ARE THE FUNDS GOING, HOW
 MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE, ARE THEY
 CITIZENS, NOT CITIZENS, YOU NEED
 IT FOR MANY REASONS.
 MAYA NORMALLY WHEN SOMEBODY
 IS BLATANT ABOUT THE WHOLE
 REASON THEY'RE GOING IN FRONT OF
 THE COURT IS A LIE, THAT WOULD
 BE THE END OF IT, BUT DONALD
 TRUMP HAS GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT
 BEFORE.
 HE SAID THE MUSLIM BAN WAS A
 MUSLIM BAN AND HE SAID I DIDN'T
 MEAN IT.
 ROBERTS HAS NOT BEEN A HUGE FAN
 OF VOTING RIGHTS.
 COULD THEY JUST CHANGE THEIR
 REASON AND SLIDE THIS RIGHT PAST
 THE SUPREME COURT?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, HERE'S --
 IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED
 BUT PROCEDURALLY, BUT LET'S SAY
 THIS, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DID WAS
 SPENT ABOUT 22 PAGES SAYING WHY
 THE ADMINISTRATION COULD PUT
 THIS QUESTION ON THE CENSUS
 DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE
 CAREERISTS, THE PEOPLE WHO
 BEHAVE IN A NONPARTISAN WAY IN
 THE CENSUS BUREAU SAID NO, WE
 DON'T THINK THIS QUESTION SHOULD
 GO ON IN ORDER TO DO WHAT WE
 NEED TO DO AS A CENSUS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, AND
 WHAT MINORITY ON THE COURT SAID,
 WHAT LIBERALS ON THE COURT SAID
 WAS WE ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THE
 WHOLE FIRST PART OF THAT OPINION
 IS RIGHT.
 WE THINK THAT THIS WAS ARBITRARY
 AND CAPRICIOUS, WHICH IS THE
 LEGAL LANGUAGE FOR AIN'T NO
 REASON FOR THIS, NO GOOD REASON,
 THAT THE FACT THAT THE
 CAREERISTS SAID NO, THIS IS BAD,
 MEANS IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN, AND
 JUST ONE MORE THING I JUST WANT
 TO ADD.
 2010 REPUBLICANS UNDER FUNDED
 THIS CENSUS EVEN BEFORE TRUMP
 WAS ELECTED.
 ABSOLUTELY, AND THEY SORT OF
 MADE WAR ON IT.
 LET ME GO TO YOU QUICKLY
 NATASHA, HOW WILL THIS LOOK ON
 THE GROUND, IF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID
 TO ANSWER THE CENSUS, THEN WHAT?
 I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM
 OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO ANSWER
 THE CENSUS, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
 SEE IS A GROSS UNDERCOUNT.
 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AN
 UNDERCOUNT IN COMMUNITIES OF
 COLOR, AND THE CHALLENGE IS THEY
 ARE $800 MILLION OF AID THAT
 GOES BY CENSUS DATA.
 YOU'LL SEE A GROSS UNDERCOUNT
 BECAUSE OF THIS.
 I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE I
 WANT TO RAISE AROUND THE
 PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE A ROGUE
 PRESIDENT THAT IN THIS PROCESS
 IN PARTICULAR, HERE IS THE
 EXECUTIVE THAT'S SAYING THAT
 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SUPREME
 COURT RULING, HE'S ACTUALLY
 SAYING THAT I'M CONSIDERING
 THESE OPTIONS.
 ONE, I'M CONSIDERING THIS OPTION
 AROUND EXECUTIVE ORDER, AND THEN
 THE SECOND THING HE'S SAYING,
 HE'S CONSIDERING THE OPTION OF
 ADDING AN ADDENDUM.
 THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT DOES
 NOT EVEN RESPECT THE LAW OF THE
 LAND.
 I REALLY THINK THAT WE'RE IN A
 CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, AND WE
 DON'T NEED TO ACT LIKE THIS IS
 NORMAL.
 THIS IS NOT NORMAL.
 THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
 THIS IS BEYOND.
 HE TOOK AN OATH AND SWORE THAT
 HE WOULD ACTUALLY UPHOLD THE LAW
 OF THE LAND, YET WE'RE SEEING
 THIS PLAY OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY.
 I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE THE
 DISTINCTION THAT HERE IT IS THAT
 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SUPREME
 COURT MADE A DECISION, HE SAYS
 THAT HE'S GOING TO DO WHATEVER
 HE WANTS TO DO ANYWAY AND WE'VE
 GOT TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 HOPEFULLY THERE'S A PLAN.
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU TALK
 ABOUT THIS MORE.
 WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK TO TALK
 ABOUT WHAT THE PLAN IS GOING TO
 BE, IF HE'S SOMEHOW ABLE TO
 THWART THE LAW.
 THE SECRET FACEBOOK GROUP OF
 BORDER PATROL AGENTS THAT IS
 RAISING NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
 TREATMENT OF MIGRANTS AND THE
 CULTURE OF THE CVP, THAT'S NEXT.

        Heinz mayonnaise,

 92% OF THE FORCE IS LATINO. A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME HOW DO
 THEY GET LATINO PEOPLE TO BEHAVE
 THIS WAY AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE
 THEIR OWN HERITAGE AND THEIR OWN
 CULTURE.
 IT'S BECAUSE IN THE ACADEMY THEY
 MANDATE AND THEY TEACH THE
 AGENTS TO USE RACIST TERMS FOR
 MIGRANTS SO THAT THEY SEE THESE
 PEOPLE AS OTHER AND THAT THEY
 ARE NOT LIKE THEM.
 IT DOES HAVE AN EFFECT.
 IT'S CONDONED AND WHEN IT
 HAPPENS AND SOMEBODY COMPLAINS,
 EVERYBODY GROUPS TOGETHER,
 SPECIFICALLY MORE THE MALE SIDE,
 AND THEY PROTECT EACH OTHER.
 A SECOND FORMERLY SECRET
 FACEBOOK GROUP FREQUENTED BY
 CURRENT AND FORMER CUSTOMS AND
 BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE BEEN
 UNEARTHED.
 CNN OBTAINED SCREEN SHOTS FROM
 TWO SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE
 FACEBOOK PAGES THAT CONTAIN
 BOLDER AND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT
 POSTS MOCKING MIGRANTS AND
 DEMEANING LAWMAKERS LIKE
 ALEXANDRIA OCASIO CORTEZ.
 NBC NEWS HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY
 IDENTIFIED THESE FACEBOOK GROUPS
 OR POSTS.
 BACK WITH ME, MIA WILEY AND
 ADAM.
 FEELING KINDA CUTE TODAY.
 IDK.
 YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT POSTED
 THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER, ASKED
 IF THE PHOTO COULD HAVE BEEN
 FAKE BECAUSE THE BODIES WERE SO,
 QUOTE, CLEAN.
 IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON.
 SOME ARE LATINO.
 IT'S NOT ALL ONLY WHITE MEMBERS
 OF THE CBP.
 WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON IN
 YOUR VIEW?
 ANY TIME YOU GIVE ONE GROUP
 OF PEOPLE AUTHORITY OVER ANOTHER
 GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU RUN THE RISK
 THAT THE PEOPLE WITH AUTHORITY
 ARE GOING TO SEE THEMSELVES AS
 ABOVE OR BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE
 WHO THEY HAVE AUTHORITY OVER.
 THE WAY YOU MITIGATE THAT IN A
 DEMOCRACY, YOU SAY THEY ARE
 PUBLIC SERVANTS.
 THEY ARE ACTUALLY EMPLOYED BY
 THE PUBLIC, THEY DON'T LORD OVER
 THE PUBLIC.
 THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IF YOU
 CREATE A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY
 WHERE PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO HAVE
 THAT AUTHORITY, PARTICULARLY
 AUTHORITY OVER LIFE AND DEATH
 ARE NEVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN
 THEY ABUSE THAT AUTHORITY, THEN
 THEY BEGIN TO RATIONALIZE THOSE
 ABUSES AS SOMEHOW JUSTIFIED
 ORNES.
 I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING
 HERE, PARTICULARLY WITH THE
 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IMPOSING
 POLICIES THAT ARE CRUEL BEYOND
 WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN PREVIOUS
 ADMINISTRATIONS, EVEN WHEN THOSE
 ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN STRICT
 ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.
 AND THE PEOPLE WHO CARRY OUT
 THOSE POLICIES HAVE TO BE ABLE
 TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO JUSTIFY
 WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
 AND ONE WAY THAT THEY DO THAT IS
 BY DENYING THE HUMANITY OF THE
 PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE -- THEY
 HAVE AUTHORITY OVER.
 YOU KNOW, THE DEHUMANIZATION
 OF THESE FOLKS, IT DID REMIND
 ME, CHRIS HAYES PUT UP A POST,
 THESE AREN'T EVEN PEOPLE OR IN
 OUR OWN PAST THE WAY THAT PEOPLE
 WERE ABLE TO TREAT OTHERS,
 WHETHER IT'S FROM ENSLAVEMENT
 ON.
 THEY'RE JUST NOT PEOPLE SO WE
 DON'T HAVE TO THINK OF THEM AS
 HUMAN BEINGS.
 YOU HAVE THIS CUSTOMS AND
 BOARDER PROTECTIONS PERSON
 SAYING THIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE
 VALUES OF CBP.
 THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS
 WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAKING
 MOCKERIES.
 MIA.
 THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT TRUE.
 WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE
 THEY AREN'T BECAUSE THERE WAS A
 2018 EXPOSURE.
 THE FACEBOOK GROUPS EXISTED IN

 I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE
 IS EXACTLY WHAT ADAM SAID, THE
 LEADERSHIP HAS TO SAY NOT ONLY
 IS THIS NOT WHO WE ARE AS AN
 INSTITUTION, IT IS NOT WHAT WE
 WILL TOLERATE AS MANAGERS.
 AND THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.
 IF YOU DON'T TAKE ACTION WHERE
 YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE
 ACTION AGAINST EMPLOYEES, IN
 THIS CASE THERE IS AN ABILITY TO
 TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION IF
 THERE'S INAPPROPRIATE SOCIAL
 MEDIA ACTIVITY.
 YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THAT WITH
 FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF
 COURSE, BUT HERE THE QUESTION IS
 PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY WHO
 ARE ARMED WHO CAN ACTUALLY
 VIOLATE THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF
 OTHER PEOPLE MUST BE HELD TO
 ACCOUNT WHEN THEY ARE
 ESSENTIALLY DEHUMANIZING IN A
 WAY THAT REALLY UNDERMINES THE
 EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AGENCY,
 WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE
 IMPARTIAL.
 REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE COMING TO
 THE BORDER HAVE A LAWFUL RIGHT
 BASED IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AS
 WELL AS U.S. LAW TO SEEK ASYLUM
 AND THE DEHUMANIZATION IS BOTH
 OFFENSIVE BUT IT ALSO
 FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINES THE
 ROLE THAT THEY ARE TO PLAY AT
 THE BORDER AND WE SHOULD BE VERY
 CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.
 BUT, I MEAN, TO -- I THINK I
 TOLD YOU EVERY WEEK, ADAM,
 CRUELTY IS THE POINT.
 THAT'S WHY THEY'RE DOING IT.
 HIS BASE WANTS TO SEE THIS SO
 HE'S SHOWING THEM THAT HE CAN
 DEHUMANIZE THEM.
 ISN'T THAT MESSAGE COMING FROM
 THE WHITE HOUSE THAT ESSENTIALLY
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO TREAT THESE
 PEOPLE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS.
 WHO CARES?
 I DO THINK THE MESSAGE IS
 COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT
 THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT HUMAN
 BEINGS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
 TREAT THEM PROPERLY.
 I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT WHEN IT
 COMES TO CHILDREN THE
 ADMINISTRATION IS VERY AWARE
 THAT ITS POLICIES ARE AT THEIR
 POLITICAL WEAKEST POINT WHEN
 PEOPLE SEE THESE IMAGES OF
 CHILDREN BEING ABUSED OR BEING
 HELD IN DEHUMANIZING CONDITIONS.
 WITH THE ADULTS IT'S A LITTLE
 DIFFERENT.
 THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO BRAG
 ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO DEPORT A
 MILLION PEOPLE, THEY'RE GOING TO
 DO A CRACKDOWN AND ALL OF THAT
 STUFF.
 WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHILDREN, I
 ACTUALLY THINK THAT THEY
 RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS DAMAGING
 FOR THEM AMONG EVERYONE AMONG
 THE MOST HARD CORE TRUMP
 SUPPORTERS.
 THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
 IT, MAYA.
 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE
 CHANGING IT.
 THEY WON'T LET THE KIDS GO.
 THEY WON'T LET THEM GO.
 THEY'RE HOLDING THEM FOR ALMOST
 60 DAYS AT SOME POINT.
 THEY JUST WON'T LET THEM GO.
 THEY WON'T LET THEM GO.
 IF THEY SEE THAT IT'S WRONG,
 WHY WON'T THEY LET THEM GO?
 THEY WON'T LET THEM GO.
 THEY HAVE THE ASTOUNDING
 APPEARANCE IN COURT WHERE THEY
 WERE IN VIOLATION OF THE
 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.
 OH, WELL, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
 PROVIDE SOAP.
 YEAH.
 THEY MOVED THEM TO ANOTHER
 FACILITY BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT
 THE CAMERAS WERE COMING.
 MOCKED THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 IN FRONT OF THE SUPERVISORS WHO
 DID NOTHING AND THEN MOVED THE
 KIDS RIGHT BACK IN.
 IF THEY REALLY BELIEVED THAT, IF
 THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO
 DEPORT THEM, THEY'RE NOT DOING
 THAT.
 IT'S INSANE.
 MAYA, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 ADAM SEWER, REALLY APPRECIATE
 YOU.
 KEEP ON QUOTING YOU.

     Audible reintroduced this        whole world to me.
       So many great stories       from amazing people.

 PREY ON THE VULNERABLE.
 THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO THEY DO
 NOT BELIEVE ARE STRONG.
 WELCOME BACK TO "AM JOY."
 ALMOST THREE YEARS AFTER HILLARY
 CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST MAJOR
 NOMINEE OF A U.S. POLITICAL
 PARTY, WE NOW HAVE SIX WOMEN
 RUNNING.
 AMONG THEM, SENATOR KAMALA
 HARRIS.
 WHO AMONG CALLING DONALD TRUMP A
 PREDATOR SHARES WHY SHE HAS THE
 CREDIBILITY TO TAKE HIM DOWN.
 I'VE HAD A LOT OF FIGHTS,
 MOST OF WHICH I'VE WON.
 I KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.
 LET ME TELL YOU, WE'RE GOING TO
 NEED SOMEBODY WHO CAN
 SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE
 AGAINST ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF
 THAT ADMINISTRATION.
 I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
 SENATOR HARRIS ALONG WITH
 SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN SAW
 THEIR STOPS SOAR IN NEW NATIONAL
 POLLS.
 THE QUINNIPIAC POLL THAT WAS
 RELEASED TUESDAY SHOWS HARRIS
 SURGING 13 POINTS SINCE LAST
 MONTH INTO SECOND PLACE.
 ONLY TWO POINTS BEHIND
 FRONT-RUNNER JOE BIDEN.
 THAT AFTER HARRIS CHALLENGED
 BIDEN OVER HIS COMMENTS ABOUT
 WORKING WITH SEGREGATIONIST
 SENATORS AND HIS OPPOSITION TO
 FEDERALLY MANDATED BUSSING IN
 THE 1970s.
 WHEN ASKED WHICH CANDIDATE DID
 THE BEST JOB AT THE DEBATE, 47%
 SAID HARRIS.
 SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY SENATOR
 ELIZABETH RAR WEN WITH 17%.
 6% SAID BIDEN HAD THE BEST
 PERFORMANCE.
 WHEN ASKED WHICH CANDIDATE HAS
 THE BEST POLICY IDEAS WARREN
 TOOK THE LEAD WITH 31% COMPARED
 TO 19% IN APRIL.
 SANDERS CAME IN AT 18% WHILE
 BIDEN RECEIVED 11%, A DROP FROM
 23 IN APRIL.
 DESPITE THESE NUMBERS, BIDEN
 REMAINS THE NOMINAL FRONT-RUNNER
 EVEN IF BARELY.
 THE CHANGES IN THE STANDINGS ARE
 RE-UPPING THE QUESTION WHETHER
 AMERICA IS FINALLY, FINALLY
 READY TO ELECT A WOMAN
 PRESIDENT.
 THERE ARE SIX OPTIONS.
 IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
 MAYA WILEY IS WITH ME.
 JOINING ME IS RASHAD ROBINSON,
 TIFFANY CROSS AND DEAN OBIDALA.
 I'M GOING TO YOU FIRST, RASHAD
 WATCHING MISSY ELLIOT AT THE
 ESSENCE FESTIVAL.
 I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAD A
 CHANCE.
 I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU GOT HERE.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A CHANCE
 TO WALK AROUND WITH PEOPLE THAT
 YOU ARE RUNNING AROUND DOWN HERE
 AT ESSENCE.
 TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE HEARING.
 IS THE KAMALA BOOM RESONATING IN
 THE REAL WORLD OR IS IT US
 PEOPLE OBSESSED WITH POLLS?
 I THINK IT'S A MIX OF BOTH.
 IT IS PEOPLE THAT ARE OBSESSED
 WITH POLLS AND THOSE OF US IN
 THE POLITICAL CLASS THAT FOLLOW
 THESE THINGS ARE SORT OF DEEPLY
 INVESTED IN LOOKING AT THE UP
 TICKS AND DOWN TICKS BUT PEOPLE
 ARE UNDERSTANDING WHO SHE IS,
 PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION TO US
 AND THAT'S THE POWER OF THE
 DEBATES.
 I'M ALSO HEARING ELIZABETH
 WARREN'S NAME A LOT FROM A
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS I WALK
 AROUND, PARTICULARLY THE WAY
 SHE'S ROLLED OUT A SET OF PLANS
 AND EXACTLY HOW SHE'S TALKING
 ABOUT HOW SHE'S GOING TO CLOSE
 SOME OF THE GAPS THAT HAVE
 PLAGUED COMMUNITIES FOR SO LONG.
 I DO THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY
 EARLY.
 EVEN THE TICKS AND HITS THAT
 BIDEN HAS TAKEN TO HIS POLLS IS
 A RECOGNITION THAT MANY OF HIS
 EARLY NUMBERS WERE JUST THAT
 PEOPLE KNEW WHO HE WAS.
 IT'S LIKE GOING INTO A STORE, A
 SUPERMARKET AND YOU PICK THE
 PRODUCT OFF THE SHELF THAT YOU
 HAVE SEEN THE MOST COMMERCIALS
 FOR, THAT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THE
 MOST ATTENTION TO.
 OVER TIME YOU MIGHT CHANGE THAT
 AS YOU LEARN MORE THINGS.
 SO I DO THINK THAT IT'S JUST
 REALLY EARLY BUT I DO THINK THAT
 THESE DEBATES ARE SHIFTING THE
 LANDSCAPE AND GIVING PEOPLE MORE
 OPPORTUNITY TO SEE CANDIDATES IN
 A DIFFERENT WAY.
 THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT,
 TIFFANY.
 THERE IS A CERTAIN HUGE
 ADVANTAGE THAT BIDEN HAD BECAUSE
 PEOPLE KNEW WHO HE IS.
 PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHO A LOT OF
 THESE PEOPLE WERE.
 PEOPLE WATCHED THE SECOND
 DEBATE, OH, SHE'S INTERESTING.
 I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S A
 POTENTIAL THAT IT'S A LITTLE
 DEEPER AND PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW
 WHO BARACK OBAMA WAS BUT WHEN
 THEY SAW HIM IN COMPARISON AND
 SAW HE WAS PLAUSIBLE.
 BIDEN IS ONLY TWO POINTS AHEAD
 IN THE LATEST POLL.
 WARREN IS RIGHT UP THERE.
 SHE'S PASSED BERNIE SANDERS, AT

 STATISTICALLY TIED BUT ONE POINT
 AHEAD OF HIM.
 SHE'S UP 13, HARRIS.
 BIDEN'S GONE DOWN 8.
 SHE'S TAKING THAT LEAD FROM HIM
 IT LOOKS LIKE.
 I WONDER IF HE'S A BIT TOO
 COMFORTABLE ASSUMING I'M THE GUY
 BLACK VOTERS LIKE.
 AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SHE'S
 ONLY FOUR POINTS DOWN AMONG
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
 THAT'S A HUGE CHANGE.
 IT FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE
 BARACK OBAMA VERSUS HILLARY
 CLINTON IN THAT '08 PRIMARY OR
 AM I READING TOO MUCH INTO IT?
 FIRST I HAVE SERIOUS FOMO
 THAT ALL OF YOU GUYS ARE AT THE
 ESSENCE FESTIVAL.
 I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT MISSY
 ELLIOTT.
 BUT BACK TO THE ISSUE AT HAND,
 BACK TO THE POINT.
 I THINK A LOT OF -- SO MANY
 PEOPLE PUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT
 THESE CANDIDATES THROUGH THE
 LENS OF CABLE NEWS NETWORKS,
 RIGHT?
 SO WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE OFFERING
 ANALYSIS IN HOW THEY FEEL EVEN
 AFTER THE DEBATE, A LOT OF TIMES
 THAT CONVERSATION IS DRIVEN BY A
 MEDIA LACKING IN DIVERSITY,
 ETHNIC DIVERSITY, DIVERSITY IN
 THOUGHT, SOCIOECONOMIC
 DIVERSITY.
 PEOPLE LOOK THROUGH A MYOPIC
 LENS.
 IT BECAME ALL ABOUT ELIZABETH
 WARREN, KAMAL HAD A HARRIS.
 WE FORGET THAT JULIO CASTRO HAD
 AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE.
 VERY OVERLOOKED CANDIDATE.
 I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS
 AND TO THAT POINT IT IS STILL
 VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS.
 YOU AND I TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT,
 JOY.
 YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE
 POLLS.
 POLLS ARE MOSTLY OLDER
 AMERICANS, PEOPLE WHO ANSWER
 LAND LINES.
 PEOPLE WHO ANSWER LAND LINES
 FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED CALLER,
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A LOT
 OF PEOPLE DOING THAT.
 WE HAVE TO DISAGGREGATE THE
 DATA.
 I THINK KAMALA HARRIS IS A VERY
 ELECTABLE CANDIDATE.
 THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE
 ELECTABLE.
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL
 ULTIMATELY SAY, YEAH, ULTIMATELY
 YOU CAN'T PUT ALL YOUR CREDENCE
 INTO WHAT POLLS ARE SAYING AND
 MEDIA ANALYSTS EVEN SAY.
 SO WE HAVE TO -- THERE'S ANOTHER
 DEBATE COMING UP A THE -- AT THE
 END OF JULY.
 WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AT A WIDER
 MAINSTREAM OUTLET.
 YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH YOU.
 WE TALK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME.
 I HAVE TO SAY, I'M GOING TO DEAN
 ON THIS, HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
 EVERYTHING TIFFANY JUST SAID IS
 TRUE BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
 TIME TO FOLLOW THIS.
 THEY LOOK AT THE POLLS, LISTEN
 TO US TALK ABOUT IT.
 YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREAT DEBATE
 THAT JULIAN CASTRO HAD.
 HE DIDN'T MOVE IN THE POLLS.
 IT FEEDS ON IT SELF.
 HE HAD A GREAT DEBATE BUT HE
 DIDN'T MOVE.
 THE THING IS PEOPLE ARE TRYING
 TO THINK.
 I HAVE TO NAIR COULD HE 800
 PEOPLE DOWN TO FOUR, RIGHT?
 THEY HAVE TO START THINKING OF
 IT AS FOUR OR FIVE INSTEAD OF

 THE NEXT DEBATE DO YOU THINK THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY OUGHT TO NARROW
 IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT?
 IT WOULD ELIMINATE SOMEONE WHO'S
 NOT POLLING VERY MUCH?
 DO YOU THINK IT'S BAD TO DO
 ANOTHER 23 PEOPLE IN THE DEBATE?
 THE JULY DEBATE, LET IT GO
 FORWARD.
 THE NEXT DEBATE, SEPTEMBER,
 ALREADY THE FIELD IS SMALLER.
 LOOK, THIS IS GOING TO BE A
 BATTLE.
 I MEAN, DONALD TRUMP TALKED
 ABOUT IT ON THE FOURTH OF JULY
 LIKE WHEN THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
 TOOK UP AIRPORTS.
 IT'S THAT KIND OF BATTLE WE'RE
 TALKING ABOUT, THE BATTLE OF
 LAGUARDIA, ONWARD TO JFK.
 THIS IS THE KIND OF BATTLE
 THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BETWEEN
 NOW AND NOVEMBER OF 2020.
 INTERNALLY IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY, THINGS ARE GOING TO
 CHANGE.
 PEOPLE WANT SOMEONE TO WIN.
 THERE ARE THREE FACTORS THEY
 WANT IN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE,
 WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP, WHO CAN BEAT
 TRUMP, WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP.
 THEY SAY EVERY TIME, VOTE BLUE
 NO MATTER WHO.
 WHOEVER I'M SUPPORTING IS FINE.
 WE'RE GOING TO UNITE AND WIN
 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.
 THE MORE POLLS YOU SEE WHERE
 SENATOR HARRIS CAN BEAT TRUMP.
 THE MORE WHERE SENATOR WARREN
 CAN BEAT TRUMP.
 NOT JUST BIDEN CAN BEAT TRUMP IT
 MAKES THEM MORE ELECTABLE AND I
 THINK UNDERCUTS THE IDEA THAT
 JOE BIDEN IS THE ONLY ONE
 ELECTABLE AND THE MORE THAT
 HAPPENS, I THINK THE MORE JOE
 BIDEN CAN STILL BE THE NOMINEE
 BUT POTENTIALLY SLIDES.
 YEAH.
 PUTTING ASIDE THE FACT THAT DEAN
 BROUGHT UP THE BATTLE IN WHICH
 GEORGE WASHINGTON, YOU KNOW,
 USED HIS FIGHTER PLANES TO BOMB
 THE BRITISH FRONT LINE, YOU
 KNOW, DURING THAT FIRST BATTLE
 TO TAKE OVER THE AIRPORTS DURING
 THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT ASIDE
 AND COME BACK TO POLITICS, MAYA
 WILEY.
 THE OTHER ISSUE, AS DEAN SAID,
 IT'S BEEN SEEN BIDEN IS THE ONLY
 ONE WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP.
 THERE HAS BEEN THIS IDEA EVEN
 AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, IT'S
 GOT TO BE A WHITE GUY.
 WHEN YOU SEE HER BEAT HIM IN A
 DEBATE, DOESN'T THAT MAKE PEOPLE
 WONDER, WAIT A MINUTE, HE CAN'T
 BEAT HER, MAYBE THIS WOMAN
 ACTUALLY IS THE ONE WHO CAN TAKE
 DONALD TRUMP DOWN?
 YEAH, I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
 I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S
 HAPPENING HERE IS THE SORT OF
 NATIONAL TRAUMA AROUND DONALD
 TRUMP HAVING WON THE 2016
 ELECTION.
 REMEMBER THAT HILLARY CLINTON
 DID WIN BY ALMOST 3 MILLION
 VOTES, WHAT SHE LOST WAS THE
 ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
 SHE LOST THAT BY BASICALLY THREE
 STATES IN THE MIDWEST, RIGHT?
 IT WAS PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN
 AND MICHIGAN.
 SO THAT'S WHERE THE OH, WE NEED
 A WHITE MAN FEAR COMES FROM BUT
 I ALSO THINK THE FACT THAT
 VOTERS VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP
 DESPITE HIS OVERT SEXISM IS PART
 OF WHY WE ARE STARTING TO HEAR
 WHAT I THINK IS A VERY DANGEROUS
 DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER IS A WOMAN
 ELECTABLE.
 WHAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IS IS A
 BLACK WOMAN ELECTABLE?
 PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THIS
 NOTION IS THE ONLY WAY WE WIN
 THE OFFICE IS BY ACTUALLY
 SACRIFICING WHO WE ARE WHEN ALL
 OF THE FUNDAMENTALS SHOW THAT
 ABSOLUTELY WOMEN AND WOMEN OF
 ALL RACES ARE ELECTABLE.
 THAT'S WHAT 2018 TAUGHT US.
 IN FACT, BACK TO YOUR EARLIER
 POINT, JOY, ABOUT BARACK OBAMA,
 ONCE HE WON THE IOWA CAUCUSES,
 HE WAS WAY BEHIND HILLARY
 CLINTON IN THE POLLS, WAY
 BEHIND.
 WHEN HE BEAT HER BY, WHAT, ABOUT
 8 POINTS IN THE IOWA CAUCUS IN
 '08, SUDDENLY HE WAS ELECTABLE.
 IT IS EARLY.
 I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING EVERYONE
 ELSE SAID.
 I THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE
 FACT THAT OUR FEAR COULD BE OUR
 WORST ENEMY IN TERMS OF GETTING
 THE KIND OF LEADER WE NEED FOR
 THE COUNTRY.
 CAN I TOP IN, JOY?
 YEAH.
 REALLY QUICKLY TO MAYA'S
 POINT.
 I THINK SOME PEOPLE VOTED FOR
 DONALD TRUMP DESPITE THESE
 THINGS.
 WE HAVE TO RECONCILE SOME PEOPLE
 VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE
 OF THESE THINGS.
 WE SEE UGLY RHETORIC.
 THESE GUYS ARE NOT RUNNING
 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, THEY'RE
 RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER.
 WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH A
 PRIMARY.
 I TAKE DEAN'S POINT OBVIOUSLY
 KAMALA HARRIS IS ELECTABLE.
 IT IS SOMETHING VOTERS SHOULD
 PAY ATTENTION TO.
 SHE HANDLED JOE BIDEN.
 I THINK THERE IS AN UNDERBELLY
 OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING TO SEE
 HER BODY DONALD TRUMP ON A
 DEBATE STAGE, DYING TO SEE HER
 SLAP HIM AROUND ON THE DEBATE
 STAGE WHICH SHE COULD HANDLE
 WELL BUT WHO'S DOING THE ASKING?
 WHO'S SAYING IS A BLACK WOMAN
 ELECTABLE?
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO
 ARE QUESTIONING THAT, THEY
 FREQUENTLY DON'T LOOK LIKE SOME
 OF US ON THE PANEL.
 SOMETIMES THEY DO.
 SOMETIMES THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT
 OF SOUTH CAROLINA WHO REALLY DO
 THINK THAT BLACK PEOPLE CAN BE,
 YOU KNOW -- WE CAN QUESTION
 OURSELVES IN A WAY THAT
 SOMETIMES NOT EVEN, YOU KNOW,
 WHITE PEOPLE QUESTION.
 YEAH, I MEAN --
 TO THAT POINT --
 GO ON.
 GO ON.
 TO TIFFANY'S POINT, WHICH I
 THINK IS EXCELLENT, THAT'S WHY
 THIS HAS TO BE ABOUT EXPANDING
 THE BASE.
 EXPANDING ELECTORATE, NOT ABOUT
 HOW MANY TRUMP VOTERS CAN BE
 PEELED OFF BUT WHERE ARE THE '08
 AND 2012 OBAMA VOTERS?
 THAT MEANS THIS CONVERSATION
 THAT OFTENTIMES THE POLITICAL
 CLASS TALKS ABOUT WITH LOW
 PROPENSITY VOTERS BUT WE LIKE TO
 TALK ABOUT HIGH POTENTIAL
 VOTERS.
 THE BLACK VOTES, THE PEOPLE OF
 COLOR, THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO
 OFTENTIMES NEVER GET TALKED TO.
 WHO IS GOING TO INSPIRE THOSE
 VOTERS TO TURN OUT?
 BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE CAN EXPAND
 THE BASE OF VOTERS AND TURN OUT
 PEOPLE THAT HAVE OTHERWISE NOT
 TURNED OUT IN THE LAST ELECTION
 AND DON'T TURN OUT OFTENTIMES IN
 ELECTIONS, WE NOT ONLY WIN
 ELECTIONS BUT WE WIN WITH THE
 TYPE OF BASE THAT ALLOWS US TO
 GOVERN IN PROGRESSIVE WAYS.
 TO PASS THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION
 AND THE TYPE OF POLICY AND
 PRACTICE CHANGE THAT THESE ARE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 SO TO THE POINT OF BOTH THE
 CONVERSATION ABOUT WHO IS HAVING
 THIS CONVERSATION IN THE MEDIA
 AND HOW THE MEDIA IS COVERING
 THIS BUT ALSO WHO THESE
 CANDIDATES ARE TALKING TO, THIS
 HAS TO BE A STORY ABOUT NOT JUST
 APPEALING TO THE LOWEST COMMON
 DENOMINATOR BUT APPEALING TO THE
 ASPIRATIONS AND EXPANDING THE
 BASE OF VOTERS.
 THAT'S WHY NEW VOICES AND VOICES
 THAT ARE UNAFRAID, WOMEN, PEOPLE
 OF COLOR ARE GOING TO BE SO
 IMPORTANT TO USHERING THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY INTO THE NEXT
 PHASE.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO DECIDE.
 DO THEY HAVE TO DO A SORT OF --
 KIND OF A NOSTALGIA VERSION OF
 THEMSELVES NORTH TO MOLLIFY A
 CERTAIN VOTER OR GO FORWARD.
 THE WOMEN SEEM TO BE LEADING
 THAT CONVERSATION AT THE MOMENT.
 MAYA WILEY, RASHAD ROBINSON,
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 TIFFANY AND DEAN WILL BE RIGHT
 BACK.
 COMING UP, WE'RE GOING TO
 TALK BIDEN AND WHETHER THIS PAST
 WEEK WAS A GLITCH OR WAS IT THE
 FIRST HOLE THAT THE ICEBERG
 RIPPED INTO THE SIDE OF THE
 TITANIC?
 THAT'S NEXT.

      Alice loves the smell      of Gain so much,
      she wished it came in      a fabric softener too.
         [throat clears]
     Say hello to your fairy     godmother, Alice.
 Oh and look they got Gain scent beads and dryer sheets too!
 Parents have a way of imagining the worst...
   ...especially when your easily distracted teenager has the car.
    At Subaru, we're taking on    distracted driving      [PING]
 with sensors that alert you when your eyes are off the road.
   The all-new Subaru Forester.
    The safest Forester ever.
 I WAS PREPARED FOR THEM COMING AT ME.
 I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THE PERSON
 COMING AT ME.
 SHE KNOWS BO, SHE KNOWS ME.
 IT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC
 BREAKOUT MOMENT OF THE
 DEMOCRATIC DEBATE.
 SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS
 CONFRONTING FORMER VICE
 PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN FOR BOASTING
 ABOUT WORKING WITH NOTORIOUSLY
 RACIST SEGREGATIONIST SENATORS
 IN PAST DECADES AND HIS STANCE
 ON BUSSING.
 ON FRIDAY BIDEN DID AN INTERVIEW
 ON CNN TRYING TO CLEAN UP.
 I THINK IF YOU TAKE A LOOK
 OUR POSITIONS AREN'T ANY
 DIFFERENT AS WE'RE FINDING OUT.
 YOU WERE NOT IN FAVOR OF
 BUSSING.
 IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME AND
 DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS, WHY NOT
 OWN IT.
 WHY NOT SAY, I WAS AGAINST IT
 AND NOW I'VE CHANGED.
 I WAS IN FAVOR OF BUSSING.
 THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU
 EQUALIZE EDUCATION IN EVERY
 AREA?
 I PUT FORWARD THE MOST
 AGGRESSIVE PLAN AND I'VE BEEN
 PUSHING IT FOR A LONG TIME.
 TIFFANY CROSS AND DEAN ARE
 BACK WITH ME.
 JOINING ME IS WILL BUNCH OF THE
 PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER.
 PHIL, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
 ABOUT THIS.
 BIDEN HAS NOW BEEN COMPARED TO
 JEB BUSH.
 GAIL COLLINS SAID SHE WORRIED
 BIDEN WOULD BE THE JEB BUSH.
 SHE SAID FEEBLE.
 HE'S THE GUY WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP.
 ANOTHER PERFORMANCE LIKE THIS
 ONE AND HE'S DONE.
 MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT YOU'RE
 SEEING FROM BIDEN IS THAT HE
 DOES SEEM TO BE A CANDIDATE
 GEARED TOWARDS THE PAST.
 I'M GOING TO BRING BACK A PAST
 THAT YOU LIKED WHICH IS THE
 OBAMA ERA.
 HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A CANDIDATE
 OF THE FUTURE.
 IS THAT A PROBLEM IN THIS RACE?
 I THINK SO.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I WAS AT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN
 PHILADELPHIA AND I THOUGHT
 PEOPLE WERE PARTYING LIKE IT WAS

 HE WANTS TO GO BACK TO THE NEAR
 PAST, RIGHT?
 TO THE OBAMA YEARS.
 I THINK EVERYTHING THAT'S
 HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE OR
 FOUR YEARS I THINK PEOPLE ARE
 LOOKING FOR A NEW DIRECTION
 FORWARD.
 YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY IN THAT
 SOUND BITE YOU PLAYED WHERE HE
 SAID HE WASN'T EXPECTING THE
 KAMALA HARRIS MOMENT, THAT'S
 REALLY SURPRISING TO ME.
 HE'S REALLY HAD 40 YEARS TO
 PREPARE FOR IT.
 HE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY ABOUT
 HIS EVOLUTION ON CIVIL RIGHTS UP
 TO THE POINT WHERE HE BECAME THE
 VICE PRESIDENT TO THE FIRST
 BLACK PRESIDENT IN THIS COUNTRY
 AND HE REALLY FUMBLED THE ANSWER
 TO WHERE HE WAS MUMBLING
 SOMETHING ABOUT STATES RIGHTS.
 IT REMINDED ME OF THE LAUNCH OF
 RONALD REGAN'S 1980 CAMPAIGN IN
 MISSISSIPPI.
 I THINK THE BROADER PROBLEM IS
 JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN ON THE
 DEFENSIVE SINCE THE DAY HE
 ENTERED THIS RACE AND I THINK
 DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE REALLY
 LOOKING FOR AFFIRMATIVE REASONS
 TO SUPPORT A CANDIDATE.
 I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S WHY
 YOU'VE SEEN ELIZABETH WARREN
 RISE SO MUCH IN THE POLLS,
 BECAUSE SHE'S PUT OUT PLAN AFTER
 PLAN AND BECOME A HASHTAG
 #IHAVEAPLANFORTHAT.
 BIDEN HASN'T CAPTURED THE PUBLIC
 IMAGINATION.
 I KNOW HE HAS SOME.
 LAST NIGHT THERE WAS A NEW VIDEO
 OF HIM MAKING THE ROUNDS WHERE A
 VOTER IN IOWA CONFRONTED HIM
 ABOUT WHAT HE WAS GOING TO
 ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH AND THE
 SUPREME COURT.
 HE TOLD HER HE DIDN'T HAVE AN
 ANSWER FOR THAT.
 A LOT OF CANDIDATES DON'T HAVE
 AN ANSWER FOR THAT.
 I THINK AGAIN AND AGAIN IF YOU
 ARE GOING TO SEE JOE BIDEN
 TRYING TO DEFEND HIS PAST RECORD
 OR TRYING TO JUSTIFY HIS
 CANDIDACY BEYOND JUST HE THINKS
 HE CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP, YOU'RE
 GOING TO SEE HIM CONTINUE TO
 ERODE IN THE POLLS IF THAT'S HIS
 STYLE AND THAT'S THE WAY HE
 CAMPAIGNS.
 YEAH, TIFFANY, THERE'S
 SOMETHING ABOUT EVEN THAT, THE
 THING THAT WILL JUST MENTIONED,
 ABOUT HIM SAYING HE'D NOMINATE
 MAYOR GARLAND AND SAY HE'S GOING
 TO GO GET THAT GUY.
 EVEN WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
 NOMINATED HIM, PEOPLE SHRUGGED
 UNTIL MITCH McCONNELL SAID NO TO
 HIM.
 THE REALITY IS, DEMOCRATS LOVE
 JOE BIDEN.
 DEMOCRATS LOVE UNCLE JOE, BUT IS
 THAT ENOUGH OF A REASON TO
 NOMINATE HIM TO BE PRESIDENT?
 DOES HE NEED A FORWARD-LOOKING
 STRATEGY THAT ISN'T JUST YOU
 LOVE ME, I'M UNCLE JOE?
 RIGHT.
 IF VOTERS ARE CONCERNED, WE WANT
 TO VOTE FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN
 BEAT DONALD TRUMP, IF JOE BIDEN
 WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT
 ON BUSSING, WHAT WILL HE NOT BE
 PREPARED FOR WHEN HE'S ON THE
 DEBATE STAGE WITH DONALD TRUMP?
 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION
 THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ASK
 THEMSELVES.
 AND, LISTEN, IT IS NOT ENOUGH IN
 TODAY'S SOCIETY IN A POST TRUMP
 AMERICA FOR YOU TO SAY, NO, NO,
 NO, BUT WAIT, MY BEST FRIEND WAS
 BLACK.
 I SERVED THE FIRST BLACK
 PRESIDENT.
 LET ME GO THROUGH THIS CLUMSY
 EXPLANATION ON HOW I CAME TO
 SOME OF THESE POLICY POSITIONS.
 THAT IS NOT GOING TO RESONATE
 WITH VOTERS, PARTICULARLY WE SAW
 IN THE MID TERMS THE SURGE IN
 YOUNGER VOTERS WHO WERE YOUNGER
 PEOPLE DURING THE OBAMA
 ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE PAYING

 MORE ATTENTION IN THIS
 LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT.
 I THINK HE HAS A LOT OF WORK TO
 DO TO RESONATE WITH VOTERS.
 YOU HAVE TO ALSO LOOK LIKE WE
 KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK
 ON JOE BIDEN'S STAFF.
 IT'S LIKE NOBODY, DID YOU NOT
 ALL THINK THAT QUESTION WOULD
 COME UP?
 AND WHY THIS TOPIC IS EVEN BEING
 DISCUSSED IN THE FIRST PLACE IS
 BECAUSE HE STARTED OUT BY
 SAYING, LISTEN, GUYS, I CAN WORK
 WITH SEGREGATIONISTS.
 I CAN WORK WITH WHITE
 SUPREMACISTS BECAUSE I HAVE DONE
 IT BEFORE.
 I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
 ARE LOOKING FOR YOU TO WORK WITH
 THESE PEOPLE.
 PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU TO
 GET THESE PEOPLE OUT ROOT AND
 STEM AND REDEFINE WHAT THIS
 GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE AND COULD
 BE FOR ALL PEOPLE INCLUDING
 PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO HAVE BEEN
 DISENFRANCHISED FOR DECADES.
 YEAH.
 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT BIDEN SAID.
 THIS IS AN -- DEAN, I WANT TO
 PLAY THIS FOR YOU.
 THIS IS JOE BIDEN TALKING ON CNN
 WHEN HE DID THIS INTERVIEW WITH
 CHRIS COMEAU.
 I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO
 HAVE A FEMALE VP.
 IF I DON'T WIN I THINK IT WOULD
 BE GREAT TO HAVE A FEMALE
 PRESIDENT.
 DO YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATIC
 TICKET CAN WIN WITHOUT A WOMAN
 IN THE SLOTS?
 YES.
 BUT I THINK IT HELPS TO HAVE A
 WOMAN ON THE TICKET.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY
 QUALIFIED WOMEN OUT THERE.
 THAT MAKES THE POINT A LITTLE
 BIT BECAUSE IT DOES TALK ABOUT
 HIM SAYING, YEAH, IT WOULD BE
 GREAT TO HAVE A FEMALE VP.
 GREAT TO HAVE A WOMAN VP
 EVENTUALLY.
 THIS IS CUT ONE FROM MY
 PRODUCERS.
 THIS IS HIM SPEAKING ABOUT HOW
 HE FELT BEING CONFRONTED BY
 KAMALA HARRIS.
 THIS IS CUT ONE.
 IT WAS HURTFUL TO HEAR YOU
 TALK ABOUT THE REPUTATIONS OF
 TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS WHO
 BUILT THEIR REPUTATIONS AND
 CAREER ON THE SEGREGATION OF
 RACE IN THIS COUNTRY.
 AND IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT BUT YOU
 ALSO WORKED WITH THEM TO OPPOSE
 BUSSING.
 SORRY ABOUT THAT.
 I DIDN'T HAVE THE CUT THAT I WAS
 LOOKING FOR.
 THE ONE I WANTED TO PLAY FOR
 YOU, I'LL JUST DESCRIBE IT TO
 YOU, DEAN.
 SURE.
 HE SAYS TO CHRIS CUOMO THAT
 IT WAS HURTFUL TO HIM TO BE
 CONFRONTED THAT WAY BY KAMALA
 HARRIS.
 SHE KNOWS MY SON.
 SHE KNOWS MY FAMILY.
 SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I THINK HAS
 A PERSON OF COLOR MAYBE HEARING
 IT, IT FEELS LIKE HE FEELS LIKE
 HE'S DONE SO MUCH.
 I DON'T KNOW, IT FELT AS IF HE
 FELT THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE
 QUESTIONED IN A SENSE BECAUSE
 HE'S BEEN BARACK OBAMA'S VP,
 THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE QUESTIONED.
 WELL, ON SOME LEVEL TO ME,
 THAT COULD BE PART OF IT, IT
 HARKENS BACK TO WHAT WE'RE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 JOE BIDEN IS A THROW BACK TO A
 DIFFERENT TIME.
 IN POLITICS THEY WOULDN'T ATTACK
 YOU.
 THEY'RE MY FRIEND.
 TO REMIND PEOPLE IN 2016 IN THE
 CALIFORNIA PRIMARY, PRESIDENT
 OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN SUPPORTED
 KAMALA HARRIS IN THAT PRIMARY.
 HE CAMPAIGNED FOR HER.
 HE KNOWS HER SON AS WELL.
 HE WAS STUNNED.
 SOMEONE WHO'S MY FRIEND ON THE
 STAGE IN FRONT OF EVERYONE WOULD
 MOCK ME.
 THAT GOES BACK CRITICIZING ON
 POLICY.
 THAT GOES BACK TO AN OLDER VIEW
 OF POLITICS.
 HEY, WE'RE ALL FRIENDS.
 WE'RE ONLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ON
 POLICY AND WE CAN ALL GET ALONG.
 THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK ANYMORE
 TODAY IN 2020.
 JOE BIDEN REMINDS US WHY IN 2008
 HE GOT LESS THAN 1% OF THE VOTE
 IN IOWA BEFORE HE DROPPED OUT OF
 THE RACE.
 HE WAS NOT A GREAT CANDIDATE.
 I THINK HE MIGHT KNOW THE
 POLICIES INSIDE AND OUT.
 AS A CANDIDATE HE'S NOT PROVING
 EACH OTHER.
 HE'S GOING TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO
 GO AND KNOCK ON DOORS, DRIVE
 THEIR FRIENDS TO POLLS, TO MAKE
 PHONE CALLS AND DONATE MONEY.
 HE'S GOING TO PICK UP HIS GAME
 TO BE THAT PERSON.
 IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK.
 I WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT.
 I'M INEVITABLE.
 GIVE ME THIS POSITION.
 NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2020.
 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE STILL CAN BE
 THE NOMINEE BUT IT'S NOT
 INEVITABLE.
 WELL, VERY QUICKLY.
 LAST WORD TO YOU ON THIS.
 DOES -- IS BIDEN RUNNING TOO
 MUCH ON SAYING ESSENTIALLY THAT
 HE'S -- HE WANTS TO BE
 PRESIDENT -- DOES HE NEED TO
 MAKE A CLEARER REASON WHY HE
 WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT OTHER THAN
 WHAT HE'S DONE IN THE PAST?
 BECAUSE IT DOES FEEL LIKE HIS
 CANDIDACY IS ROOTED IN A THING
 LIKE I'VE DONE ALL OF THIS FOR
 YOU IN THE PAST, NOW IT'S TIME
 FOR ME TO BE PRESIDENT.
 IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A
 STRONG -- I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO
 YOU THINK?
 YOU'RE ASKING ME?
 I'M SORRY --
 FOR WILL.
 YEAH.
 THAT'S OKAY.
 PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE'S
 GOING TO DO.
 ALSO AT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT HE
 SAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO DO
 SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE,
 BEAT DONALD TRUMP.
 THAT'S HOW YOU DO SOMETHING
 ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.
 ON SOME LEVEL THAT'S RIGHT.
 YOU HAVE OTHER CANDIDATES WITH
 MUCH MORE DETAILED PLANS.
 WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT MERIT
 GARLAND, THAT'S A PERFECT
 REMINDER WHY THE CONGENIAL
 APPROACH FROM THE 1970s THAT HE
 WANTS TO BRING BACK ISN'T GOING
 TO WORK IN THE 21st CENTURY.
 HOW CAN SOMEBODY WHO WAS THERE
 FOR MERRITT GARLAND AND WHAT
 MITCH McCONNELL DID TO HIM THINK
 HE CAN GET ALONG WITH
 REPUBLICANS IN ANY WAY?
 THEY HAD A POLICY OF EIGHT YEARS
 OF TRYING NOT TO GET ANYTHING
 FOR OBAMA, TO DENY HIM A SECOND
 TERM AND TO DENY HIM A SUPREME
 COURT SEAT.
 AND WHY THAT WAS SUDDENLY
 CHANGED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF
 JOE BIDEN AS PRESIDENT, I JUST
 DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL.
 YEAH, I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU
 CAN BEAT MASSIVE RESISTANCE WITH
 COMMITY.
 DEAN AND TIFFANY WILL BE BACK.
 WILL BUNCH, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
 WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK ON AGAIN.
 COMING UP.
 AFTER MULTIPLE INDOOINLTS, OVER
 10,000 LIES AND BOWING TO
 DICTATORS ACROSS THE GLOBE
 DONALD TRUMP HAS SEEN EXACTLY
 ONE ELECTED REPUBLICAN QUIT
 THEIR PARTY.
 JUSTIN AMISH'S INDEPENDENCE DAY

 I WAS HOPING TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR PEOPLE.
 I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN PARTY
 POLITICS FOR A WHILE AND I
 BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT IT'S
 HURTING OUR COUNTRY AT THIS
 POINT.
 AND I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO STAND
 UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT, STAND UP
 FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN AND BE
 INDEPENDENT OF THESE PARTY
 LOYALTIES THAT REALLY DIVIDE US.
 THAT IS FORMER AND THAT IS
 RIGHT FORMER REPUBLICAN
 CONGRESSMAN JUSTIN AMASH WHY HE
 CHOSE TO LEAVE THE PARTY
 CHOOSING, YOU GUESSED IT, THE
 FOURTH OF JULY TO HAVE HIS
 INDEPENDENCE.
 HE EXPLAINED HIS DECISION TO
 QUIT THE PARTY ENTIRELY IN A
 "WASHINGTON POST" OP ED SAYING
 TRUE TO WASHINGTON'S FEARS, THEY
 HAVE IGNORED THE MOST BASIC
 TENANTS OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL
 ORDER.
 THE RESULT HAS BEEN THE
 CONSOLIDATION OF POLITICAL POWER
 AND THE NEAR DISINTEGRATION OF
 REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY.
 BACK WITH ME IS DEAN AND NOELLE
 AND JASON JOHNSON, NOT THE
 JOURNALIST JASON JOHNSON.
 CONSULTANT AND FORMER ADVISOR OF
 TED CRUZ.

 THERE ARE TWO OF YOU GUYS.
 YOU KNOW THIS GUY.
 TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIM.
 HE IS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER.
 A LOT OF MUTUAL FRIENDS.
 WHAT I DO ADMIRE A GREAT DEAL,
 IT TOOK THE SON OF A PALESTINIAN
 REFUGEE TO STAND UP FOR
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I SAY THAT AS A SON OF A
 PALESTINIAN IMMIGRANT.
 LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING,
 DONALD TRUMP CALLED HIM A
 DISLOYAL REPUBLICAN.
 THIS IS A GUY WHO IS A FOUNDER
 OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS.
 THIS IS A GUY WITH A HIGHER
 RATING FROM THE AMERICAN
 CONSERVATIVE RATING, HIGHER THAN
 LINDSEY GRAHAM.
 IT'S NOT ABOUT LOYALTY TO
 REPUBLICAN PARTY OR CONSERVATIVE
 PRINCIPLES, IT'S LOYALTY TO
 DONALD J. TRUMP.
 HE REFUSED TO BE LOYAL TO HIM.
 HE PUT THE CONSTITUTION ABOVE
 HIS PARTY AND NOW HE'S PUT HIS
 PARTY TO THE SIDE.
 I STAND UP FOR THE UNITED STATES
 OF AMERICA.
 I APPLAUD HIM FOR THAT.
 VERY QUICKLY, HE'S SYRIAN AND
 PALESTINIAN?
 HE'S 100% -- I'M A HALF ARAB
 GUY.
 HE'S A PURE OUT THERE.
 I THINK IT'S PROBABLY SHOCKED A
 LOT OF REPUBLICANS.
 AND, NICK, IT USED TO BE --
 I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN
 A PLURALITY, WE'RE GEARED
 TOWARDS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
 THERE'S BEEN A HUGE EXIT OF THE
 PARTY BY PEOPLE IN THE
 BACKGROUND.
 HE'S NOT FOR THAT REASON.
 HIS PIECE IN THE WASHINGTON POST
 I THOUGHT WAS BRILLIANT.
 HE REALLY EXPLAINED WHERE WE ARE
 IN TERMS OF HYPER PARTISANSHIP
 ERODING OUR POLITICS.
 THAT'S REALLY ON ONE SIDE MORE
 THAN THE OTHER.
 YOU HAD THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SAY
 BARACK OBAMA DOESN'T EXIST.
 WE WILL MAKE HIM NOT EXIST.
 WHY IS HE THE ONLY ONE, NOELLE?
 I THINK IT WAS A WRONG MOVE
 THAT HE LEFT THE REPUBLICAN
 PARTY.
 ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T LIKE
 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, HE DOES
 RESPECT THE PLATFORM OF THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY.
 SO, YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY -- IN
 MY OPINION, YOU REALLY CAN'T
 MAKE CHANGE AND YOU REALLY CAN'T
 MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU JUST
 QUIT, YOU JUST QUIT THE PARTY
 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE WHO'S
 REPRESENTING THE PARTY.
 YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT AN
 OPPORTUNITY WHILE YOU'RE IN THE
 PARTY TO GET OTHER PEOPLE TO
 CONVINCE THEM, YOU KNOW, MAKING
 CHANGE WITH POLICY.
 REALLY THE WAY YOU MAKE CHANGE
 IS IN POLICY, NOT BY QUITTING,
 BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S NOT GOING TO
 GO ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JOIN
 THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.
 SO IT JUST LEAVES HIM TO BE AN
 INDEPENDENT AND THE LIKELIHOOD
 OF HIM GETTING RE-ELECTED IS
 PROBABLY NOT GOOD.
 SO, THEREFORE, YOU KNOW, I WISH
 THAT HE WOULD HAVE STAYED AND
 MADE HIS CASE AND REALLY FOUGHT
 FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED IN AND
 TRIED TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF
 THE CORE VERSUS JUST QUITTING
 IT.
 FIRST OF ALL, DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY.
 WE DON'T USE SORT OF FAKE NAMES.
 WE'RE GOING WITH DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY.
 I WANT TO GO TO YOU, JASON.
 LET'S SAY HE LOVES THE TAX CUTS
 FOR THE RICH.
 HE LIKES THAT REPUBLICAN THING.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW HE COULD LIKE
 THE KIDS IN CAGES.
 LET'S SAY HE LIKES THAT, TOO.
 WHAT HE SPECIFICALLY HAS A
 PROBLEM WITH IS BREAKING THE
 LAW.
 THIS GUY HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR.
 HE ACTUALLY READ THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 HE'S ONE OF THE FEW IN CONGRESS
 THAT READ IT.
 HE SAID, OH, THIS GUY VIOLATED
 TEN TIMES THE LAW THAT FEFGS A
 CIVILIAN HE'D BE IN PRISON FOR
 OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE.
 IF YOU CAN'T BE FOR THE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 HAVING TO ACTUALLY UPHOLD THE
 LAW HE SWEARS TO UPHOLD, I'M NOT
 SURE WHAT YOUR PURPOSE IS AS A
 POLITICIAN.
 DOESN'T HE GET CREDIT FOR SAYING
 THIS GUY VIOLATED, I'M OUT OF
 HERE.
 JOY, TWO THINGS.
 NUMBER ONE, I'M NOT GOING TO SIT
 HERE AND TRY TO ARGUE THAT
 JUSTIN AMASH'S EXIT FROM THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY AND DECLARING
 HIMSELF INDEPENDENT IS DETACHED
 AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS
 CALLING FOR IMPEACHMENT OF THE
 PRESIDENT.
 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I
 UNDERSTAND IT'S TEMPTING TO GET
 WRAPPED UP IN JUST THE DONALD
 TRUMP SECTION.
 IF YOU READ THAT EDITORIAL, I,
 TOO, THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.
 THE REALITY IS LONG BEFORE
 DONALD TRUMP CAME ON THIS HYPER
 PARTISAN SHIP.
 WHY SHOULD JUSTIN AMASH, A
 MEMBER TODAY ELECTED BY HIS
 DISTRICT OF THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES, BE ANY LESS
 EFFECTIVE IN ARGUING FOR HIS
 BRAND OF CONSTITUTIONAL
 CONSERVATISM SIMPLY BECAUSE HE
 DOESN'T HAVE AN "R" NEXT TO HIS
 NAME?
 I'M NOT SAYING HE WILL BE LESS
 EFFECTIVE, THAT MAKES THE POINT.
 THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY,
 YOU EITHER ARE ON TEAM RED OR
 TEAM BLUE AND I THINK WE ALL
 KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE
 LISTEN OR WE'RE OPEN MINDED TO
 THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BASED
 UPON THE COLOR OF THE OTHER
 PERSON'S JERSEY, AND THAT'S
 UNFORTUNATE.
 IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY.
 TO THAT POINT, NOELLE, ANSWER
 THAT.
 IT'S TRUE.
 IF YOU THINK HE IS WITH THE
 CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES, IF HE
 TAKES OFF OF TEAM RED PEOPLE
 WON'T LISTEN TO HIM?
 WHY SHOULDN'T HE HE GET
 RE-ELECTED?
 I FEEL LIKE THAT WE HAVE
 TURNED POLITICS INTO A BLOOD
 SPORT.
 I MEAN --
 BUT AREN'T YOU DOING THAT BY
 SAYING THAT IF HE TAKES OFF THE
 RED JERSEY, SUDDENLY HE CAN'T
 GET RE-ELECTED.
 WHY SHOULDN'T HE?
 BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE HARD
 TO RAISE MONEY, THAT'S NUMBER
 ONE.
 IF YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR BACK ON
 THE GOP -- HE SAID HE WAS
 QUITTING THE GOP.
 HE COULD HAVE SAID, I'M QUITTING
 TEAM TRUMP.
 HE'S QUITTING THE GOP.
 HOLD ON A SECOND.
 DONALD TRUMP IS THE GOP.
 DONALD TRUMP IS THE HEAD OF THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY.
 HE'S RUNNING -- ALL OF THE
 POLICIES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS
 PUTTING IN PLACE, YOUR PARTY
 100% IS STANDING BEHIND HIM ON
 WHETHER IT'S THE CHILDREN IN
 CAGES WHICH VIOLATES ALL KINDS
 OF LAWS AND MAYBE THE GENEVA
 CONVENTION.
 THEY'RE BEHIND HIM ON TARIFFS
 WHICH ARE DESTROYING PEOPLE'S
 FARMS AND RANCHES, DESTROYING
 THEIR LIVES.
 THEY'RE BEHIND HIM ON EVERYTHING
 HE DOES EVEN IF HE'S SAYING I'M
 GOING TO IGNORE THE SUPREME
 COURT.
 IF NO ONE IS QUIT OVER THAT,
 CHARLOTTESVILLE, NOTHING ELSE,
 DOES THE GUY GET CREDIT FOR
 SAYING HE HAS SOME PRINCIPLE?
 AT SOME POINT HE SAYS ENOUGH.
 HE TOTALLY GETS CREDIT FOR
 BEING HIS OWN MAN AND STANDING
 UP FOR THINGS THAT HE DOESN'T
 BELIEVE IN OR AGREE WITH, BUT TO
 QUIT THE PARTY.
 THE PARTY IS NOT THE -- THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORM IS NOT
 DONALD TRUMP.
 IT'S A PLATFORM --
 BUT IT IS.
 YES, IT IS.
 IT IS DONALD TRUMP.
 IT IS 100% DONALD TRUMP.
 IT'S WHATEVER HE WANTS, HE DOES
 IT.
 WHATEVER DONALD TRUMP WANTS,
 THAT'S THE PLATFORM.
 BUT HE RAN UNDER THE GOP
 LABEL.
 THE GOP DIDN'T RUN ON HIS LABEL
 OR HIS BRAND.
 SO IN EFFECT --
 SO THEN THE KIDS IN CAGES ARE
 THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM?
 WELL, I -- I JUST FEEL LIKE,
 YOU KNOW, BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
 POINT, I JUST FEEL LIKE FOR HIM
 TO TRY TO DO A RE-ELECTION
 CAMPAIGN RAISING MONEY, TRYING
 TO DEPEND ON MAJOR GOP DONORS TO
 HELP GET HIS MESSAGE OUT.
 I JUT DON'T SEE HIM GETTING
 RE-ELECTED WHEN HE QUITS THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY.
 I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO RUN AS
 AN INDEPENDENT.
 YOU COULD.
 WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET
 THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THAT?
 IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.
 LET ME GIVE JASON THE LAST
 RECORD.

 JASON, WILL THERE BE OTHER
 JUSTIN AMASHs IN YOUR OPINION?
 WE WILL SEE MORE MEMBERS.
 IT'S AMAZING, OUT OF 435 ELECTED
 REPRESENTATIVES IN THE PEOPLE'S
 HOUSE, THERE NOW IS ONLY ONE
 INDEPENDENT.
 WE HEAR ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW
 AT LEAST 1/3 OF THE COUNTRY IS
 IN FACT INDEPENDENT YET THERE'S
 ONE OUT OF 435.
 GO FORWARD, AND THIS APPLIES TO
 BOTH PARTIES.
 UNLESS THESE ARE COALITIONS OF
 POLICY DEMANDERS START TO
 RESPOND IN THEIR BASES, ON THE
 BRAND I THINK WE WILL SEE MORE
 INDIVIDUALS DECLARING THARP
 INDEPENDENCE GO FORWARD.
 LAST QUESTION FOR YOU, DEAN?
 THEY MIGHT.
 HE GOT A STANDING OVATION.
 LET'S BE HONEST.
 THE GOP IS ABOUT LOYALTY TO
 DONALD TRUMP ONLY.
 IT STANDS FOR NOTHING.
 THE GOP IS TRUMP AND TRUMP IS
 THE GOP.
 IT'S A PARTY OF NOT TEAM RED,
 IT'S TEAM TRUMP.
 NOT ONE REPUBLICAN STOOD UP FOR
 JUSTIN WHEN TRUMP SAID HE'S
 DISLOYAL.
 THE DICTATOR IN CHIEF DEMANDED
 HE BE GONE.
 I RECOMMEND EVERYONE READS
 JUSTIN AMASH'S PIECE.
 IT'S VERY GOOD.
 COMING UP, THE FREAK OUT
 OVER A TEENAGE MERMAID AND WHAT
 IT TELLS US ABOUT AMERICA'S
 CULTURE WARS NEXT.

 VOICE OF DISNEY'S NEWEST
 AERIAL, HALLIE BAILEY WHO IS SET
 TO STAR IN THE LIVE ACTION
 LITTLE MERMAID REMAKE.
 WELL, NOW HERE'S WHAT YOU MAY
 WANT TO HAVE ANY KIDS UNDER 12
 LEAVE THE ROOM.
 GIVE YOU A MOMENT, TAKE THEM OUT
 THE ROOM.
 OKAY.
 SO MERMAIDS AREN'T REAL.
 I KNOW, THEY'RE NOT REAL.
 SO IN THEORY, ANYONE COULD PLAY
 A MERMAID, RIGHT?
 WRONG.
 THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER CASTING
 HAS CAUSED A MULTIDAY FREAKOUT
 AMONG SOME DISNEY FANS WHO ARE
 UPSIT THAT THE ACTRESS CAST TO
 PLAY AERIAL IS NOT WHITE.
 BACK WITH ME IS TIFFANY CROSS OF
 THE BEAT D.C. AND JOINING ME
 ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST CHRIS
 WITHERSPOON.
 THIS YOUNG LADY IS ADORABLE, THE
 YOUNG LADY WHO'S GOING TO A
 ARIEL.
 YES.
 SHE TWEETS OUT DREAM COME TRUE,
 PEOPLE ARE EXCITED THAT YOU'RE
 GOING TO HAVE THIS LITTLE
 AFRICAN AMERICAN GIRL BEING
 ARIEL.
 BUT THE FREAKOUT WAS REAL.
 I THINK IT TRENDED FOR A COUPLE
 DAYS AFTER THIS HAPPENED.
 PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING SHE'S
 SUPPOSED TO BE WHITE WITH RED
 HAIR, WHAT THE "H"?
 WHAT IS GOING ON?
 I WAS SHOCKED BY THE FREAKOUT
 MYSELF AND A LOT OF THE FOLKS
 WHO ARE FREAKING OUT WERE WHITE
 ADULTS WITH LITTLE MERMAID THAT
 CAME ON THAT HAD THIS WHITE
 DEPICTION OF A PRINCESS THAT WE
 HAVE SEEN FOR DECADES.
 I THINK THAT THE FREAKOUT IS
 UNWARRANTED.
 THE REREALITY IS THERE HAVE BEEN
 11 DISNEY PRINCESSES.
 GUESS HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN
 BLACK.
 JUST ONE.
 SO 91% OF THE DEPICTION IN THE
 NARRATIVE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A
 PRINCESS HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS
 WHITE LENS.
 IT'S PAST DUE.
 AND THE LAST TIME WE HAD A BLACK
 PRINCESS WAS TEN YEARS AGO.
 SO CALM DOWN, HAVE SEVERAL
 SEATS, AND LET'S EMBRACE HALLIE
 AND ALL HEF TALENT.
 SHE'S FIERCE AND SHE DESERVES
 THIS ROLE HANDS DOWN.
 LET ME READ ONE TWEET.
 THANK YOU TO MY TEAM FOR PURTING
 THIS UP THERE.
 THIS SORT OF MADE THE POINT WELL
 IN THE IS STEPHANIE RENEE WHO
 SAYS MY CHILDREN WERE RAISED
 WITH ARIEL.
 SHE'S AN ICON IN THE EYES OF
 MANUFACTURE CHILDREN AND ADULTS
 OF TODAY.
 SO CHANGE HER RACE IS ABSURD.
 THAT WOULD BE LIKE SOMEBODY
 MAKING A MOVIE OF OPRAH WINFREY
 AND HIRING A WHITE GIRL TO PLAY
 OPRAH.
 FIRST OF ALL, SHE'S A REAL
 PERSON.
 SO IF YOU MADE A MOVIE ABOUT HER
 YOU WOULD WANT TO HER TO LOOK
 KIND OF LIKE OPRAH.
 THIS ISN'T A DOCUMENTARY.
 THERE'S NO SUCH PERSON AS ARIEL.
 THERE'S NO TIME UNDER THE SEA
 WHERE SEBASTIAN SAYS ARIEL AND
 YOUR WHITENESS IN YOUR CAUCASIAN
 EXPERIENCE, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
 SO WE COULD EASILY RECREATE AND
 RETELL THIS STORY HOWEVER WE SEE
 FIT.
 I THINK DISNEY IS DOING A GREAT
 JOB AT BEING INCLUSIVE AND NEW
 WAYS TO TELL DIVERSE NARRATIVES
 AND COLORBLIND CASTING.
 TIFFANY, WHEN MALCOLM "X" WAS
 MADE, I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS
 BRILLIANT.
 I HAD A SLIGHT PROBLEM WITH
 DENZEL WASHINGTON IS A GENIUS
 BECAUSE HE'S DARKER SKIN AND
 HAVING LIGHT SKIN WAS PART OF
 MALCOLM "X'S" CHARACTER.
 IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMEONE
 LIKE THAT, MAYBE THE CASTING WAS
 ODD BECAUSE HIS WHOLE
 PERSONALITY HAD TO DO WITH HIS
 COMPLEXION.
 BUT THIS ISN'T A DOCUMENTARY.
 IT'S ABOUT A FICTIONAL PRETEND
 CREATURE THAT'S A FISH.
 AND EVEN THE CRAZY LADY
 THAT'S TWEETING OUT THE TWEET
 YOU JUST READ, HOW MANY WHITE
 PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY PLAYED REAL
 BLACK PEOPLE?
 YOU'VE HAD WHITE ACTORS PLAY
 MICHAEL JACKSON AND OTHER
 PEOPLE.
 HOW OFTEN DO YOUR STORIES GET
 WHITEWASHED IN MAINSTREAM
 HOLLYWOOD?
 HONESTLY, I HAVE A THEY'RE PRIT
 THINK THE NOT MY ARIEL THING
 TRENDED BRIEFLY BECAUSE OF THOSE
 FRINGE INTERNET SECTION COMMENTS
 CRAZY PEOPLE WHO TWEET OUT THESE
 RIDICULOUS THINGS.
 BUT I THINK THE OVERWHELMING
 MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS
 TREND WERE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREED,
 WHO WERE SAYING HOW RIDICULOUS
 YOU SOUND SAYING THIS IS NOT MY
 ERA.
 THIS GOES BACK TO THE MEGYN
 KELLY COMMENTS SAYING SANTA IS
 NOT WHITE.
 WE CAN LOOK AT THE DISNEY
 PRINCESSES AND THEY ALL LOOK THE
 SAME.
 EVEN AMONG THE WHITE PRINCESSES
 THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.
 THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DISABLED
 PRINCESS OR OVERWEIGHT PRINCESS.
 THERE'S SO MANY AREAS WE CAN
 GROW AND LEARN IN THESE SPACES
 'TO THE YOUR POINT, IT'S A
 CARTOON CHARACTER CREDITOR YOU
 IDIOTS, WHAT ARE YOU UPSET
 ABOUT?
 YOU HAVE SOUND SO RIDICULOUS.
 I NEVER -- I NEVER DISAGREE
 WITH ANYTHING THAT TIFFANY SAYS,
 BUT SANTA IS REAL, HIS NAME IS
 LARRY, WE'VE HAD HIM ON THE SHOW
 TWICE.
 SO I'M JUST SAYING, SANTA AS
 REAL, DON'T PLAY WITH ME WITH
 SANTA BECAUSE I MET HIM, OKAY.
 I CAN SAY ABOUT HALLIE
 BAILEY, THIS GIRL IS SO
 TALENTED.
 HER AND HER SISTER, THEY WRITE
 MUSIC, THEY UNDERSTAND MUSIC,
 THEY'RE PART OF THE BEYONCE
 FAMILY WHICH YOU KNOW I'M THE
 HONORARY PRESIDENT OF THE BEE
 ONSIS?
 I DID KNOW THAT.
 CHRIS, YOU'RE MY HONARY
 COCHAIR OF THE BEYONCE FAN CLUB.
 SHE'S SO TALENTED.
 IF THERE'S ONE SAD THING TO BE
 TAKEN AWAY, IT'S THAT HER JOY
 WAS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE OF THESE
 FRINGE CRAZY PEOPLE TWEETING
 THESE THINGS.
 I THINK THE FINGER POINTING,
 IT SHOULD GO TOWARDS HOLLYWOOD
 AND THE FACT THAT OVERTHE PAST,
 YOU KNOW, SINCE 1937 AND DISNEY
 FILMS WE'VE SEEN SNOW WHITE AND
 CINDERELLA AND SLEEPING BEAUTY
 AND THEY'VE ALL LOOKED THE SAME,
 AS YOU SAID.
 SO I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT
 HOLLYWOOD BEGINS TO EMBRACE AND
 OPEN DOORS AND ALLOW CREATIVES
 THAT HAVE THESE STORIES TO TELL.
 EXACTLY.
 THEY CAN CREATE NEW STORIES.
 MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
 ARIEL, MAYBE IT WILL BE A BLACK
 PRIB SAYS WHO LIVES IN HARLEM OR
 BROOKLYN.
 WE NEED TO SEE MORE NEW STORIES.
 AND BY THE WAY, THE PEOPLE
 SORT OF OVERALL, THIS COMES TO
 THE OVERALL TRAUMA THAT PEOPLE
 ARE FEELING ABOUT THE CHANGES IN
 THE CULTURE AND THAT THE CULTURE
 DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEM ANYMORE,
 THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THE CENTER.
 THIS IS ALL A BIGGER PICTURE.
 WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS
 BECAUSE THERE IS A BIGGER
 PICTURE.

 THANK YOU, GUYS.

 BREAK.

       ave moderate to   severe rheumatoid arthritis,
        month after month,
     the clock is ticking on    irreversible joint damage.
    Ongoing pain and stiffness
   are signs of joint erosion.
 HUMIRA can help stop the clock.
     Prescribed for 15 years,
   HUMIRA targets and blocks a      source of inflammation
  that contributes to joint pain     and irreversible damage.
      HUMIRA can lower your   ability to fight infections.
      Serious and sometimes         fatal infections
     including tuberculosis,           and cancers,
       including lymphoma,          have happened;
      as have blood, liver,   and nervous system problems,
   serious allergic reactions,
       and new or worsening          heart failure.
       Tell your doctor if       you've been to areas
 where certain fungal infections           are common,
      and if you've had TB,
           hepatitis B,
     are prone to infections,
         or have flu-like        symptoms or sores.
        Don't start HUMIRA    if you have an infection.
       Help stop the clock
     on further irreversible          joint damage.
   Talk to your rheumatologist.
      Right here. Right now.
