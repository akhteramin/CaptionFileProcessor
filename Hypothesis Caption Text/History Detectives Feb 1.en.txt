 WE'RE THE HISTORY DETECTIVES,  AND WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE  SOME UNTOLD STORIES  FROM AMERICA'S PAST.
Gwendolyn:   THIS WEEK,  THIS NAVY SCHOONER  ONCE FLEW THE FLAG  IN A BORDER DISPUTE  WITH THE MIGHTY BRITISH EMPIRE.
 ARE THESE HER  LAST REMAINS? OH, MY.
Elyse:  HOW IS THIS CONNECTICUT  FARMHOUSE CONNECTED  TO THE ASSASSINATION  OF A RUSSIAN CZAR? Tukufu:  AND IS THIS PAINTING  AN UNKNOWN WORK  BY AN IMMIGRANT POET  WHOSE WORDS INSPIRED  AN AMERICAN GENERATION? People chanting: END THE WAR! END THE WAR! Elvis Costello: [Music] WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] [Music] I GET SO ANGRY WHEN THE TEARDROPS START [Music] [Music] BUT HE CAN'T BE WOUNDED 'CAUSE HE'S GOT NO HEART [Music] [Music] WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] [Music] IT'S JUST LIKE WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] Gwendolyn:  THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE POSSIBLE  BY CONTRIBUTIONS  TO YOUR PBS STATION  FROM VIEWERS LIKE YOU.
 OUR FIRST STORY INVESTIGATES  A MARITIME MYSTERY  WASHED UP ON  AN OREGON BEACH.
 1846: TENSIONS BETWEEN  THE U.S.
AND BRITAIN  ARE APPROACHING  A BOILING POINT.
 ALL EYES ARE FOCUSED  ON THE DISPUTED BORDER  BETWEEN THE U.S.
 AND THE BRITISH COLONIAL  TERRITORY OF CANADA.
 AT STAKE IS OWNERSHIP  OF THE ENORMOUS RICHES  OF SOME 300,000 SQUARE MILES  OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
 THE U.S.
NEEDS  RECONNAISSANCE  AND DISPATCHES  AN ARMED NAVAL VESSEL,  THE USS SHARK.
 BUT THAT SEPTEMBER,  DISASTER STRIKES.
 THE SHARK WRECKS  AND SINKS  AT THE TREACHEROUS MOUTH  OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
 MORE THAN A CENTURY  AND A HALF LATER,  14-YEAR-OLD  MIRANDA PETRONE  FROM TUALATIN, OREGON,  THINKS SHE MAY HAVE FOUND  A PIECE OF THIS  HISTORIC SHIP.
ME AND MY DAD WERE WALKING ALONG THE BEACH, AND I SAW THIS BIG THING WITH RUST, AND I'M LIKE, HEY, DAD, COME HERE.
HI.
I'M GWEN WRIGHT, NICE TO MEET YOU.
SO I HEAR YOU FOUND SOMETHING PRETTY INTERESTING AROUND HERE.
YEAH, I DID.
WHAT WAS IT? I FOUND A CANNON.
NOW, ARE YOU SURE IT WAS A CANNON? WELL, NOT AT FIRST.
ME AND MY DAD WERE WALKING ALONG THE BEACH AND THERE WAS THIS BIG BLACK ROCKY THING, SO I WENT UP A LITTLE CLOSER AND EVENTUALLY SAW RUST.
I THOUGHT, ROCKS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE RUST, AND SO I CALLED MY DAD OVER.
HE CAME AND CHECKED IT OUT.
HE WAS LIKE, HUH, MAYBE IT'S A CANNON.
HE WAS JUST JOKING, THOUGH, BUT I STILL WENT OUT THERE, AND IT WAS, SO...
NOW, I'M HOPING THOSE ARE SOME PICTURES YOU TOOK.
IS THAT RIGHT? YES.
SO THIS IS YOU.
ARE THESE YOUR SISTERS OR FRIENDS? WELL, THAT ONE'S MY SISTER AND THAT ONE'S MY FRIEND.
WHAT DID YOU NOTICE, ACTUALLY, WAS IT THIS RUST HERE? YEAH, I WALKED UP CLOSER AND SAW THERE WAS RUST.
AND THEN THIS FRIEND OF OURS FOUND THE SECOND ONE.
 MIRANDA'S FRIEND MADE  A SIMILAR FIND,  ANOTHER BIG  STONE-COVERED OBJECT.
WAS IT IN THE SAME PLACE? UM, NO, IT WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT FARTHER OUT.
 MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY GENERATED  A LOT OF LOCAL EXCITEMENT.
 THE MEDIA SPECULATED  SHE'D FOUND A RELIC  FROM THE SHIPWRECK OF AN OLD  NAVY VESSEL CALLED THE SHARK.
IT WAS MADE IN 1821, AND IT CRASHED IN 1846 AROUND THIS AREA.
WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT? MY DAD, HE LOOKED AT THIS BOOK, AND IT SHOWED PICTURES OF THE SHARK, KIND OF LOOKED AT THEM, WE WERE LIKE, OKAY, WELL, THIS HAS SOME SIMILARITIES.
 MIRANDA'S RESEARCH  INDICATED  THAT THE SHARK SANK  IN THE COLUMBIA RIVER  60 TO 75 MILES  NORTH OF HERE  AND THAT SOME WRECKAGE  COULD HAVE DRIFTED SOUTH  TO THIS BEACH.
CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D LIKE FOR ME TO FIND OUT? I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT IF IT REALLY IS A CANNON AND IF IT REALLY DID COME FROM THE SHARK.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND FOR YOU, OKAY? OKAY.
 WHATEVER IT IS SHE'S FOUND  IS NOW BEING PROTECTED  BY THE OREGON PARKS  AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT  AT NEHALEM BAY  STATE PARK.
HI, ARE YOU CHRIS HAVEL? I AM.
GWEN WRIGHT, SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
 CHRIS HAVEL IS  THE PROJECT COORDINATOR  FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S  CANNON CONSERVATION.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
OH, MY.
IT'S ACTUALLY BEAUTIFUL, ALL THESE COLORS.
WELL, I CAN SEE THAT THIS ONE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A CANNON, ALTHOUGH THE OTHER ONE, NOT AT ALL.
SO WHAT IS THIS STUFF THAT'S ALL OVER IT BEYOND THE ROCKS AND STONES I CAN SEE? WELL, THESE ARE CONCRETIONS.
THIS IS A NATURAL FORM OF CONCRETE THAT FORMS AROUND ANYTHING THAT'S LEFT ON THE OCEAN SHORE IN CONTACT WITH THE SAND FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
DOES THIS KIND OF CONCRETION GIVE YOU ANY IDEA ABOUT AGE? IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL THE AGE JUST BASED ON THE CONCRETION.
THE KIND OF CHEMICALS THAT ARE ON THE BEACH, THE WEATHERING, HOW MUCH WATER IS THERE, THE SALINITY, ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN AFFECT HOW QUICKLY THE CONCRETIONS BUILD UP.
 CHRIS SAYS  MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY  HAS THE DEPARTMENT EXCITED  BECAUSE 100 YEARS AGO,  ANOTHER CANNON, ALSO PRESUMED  TO BE FROM THE USS SHARK,  WAS RETRIEVED FROM  THE VERY SAME BEACH.
I'VE GOT A DRAWING HERE.
 CHRIS COMPARES THE SOAKING MASS  OF SEDIMENT AND RUST  TO A DIAGRAM OF A  SHARK-ERA CARRONADE,  OR SHORT-BARRELED CANNON, THAT  COULD BE HIDDEN BENEATH IT.
 BUT IF I'M TO DETERMINE  WHETHER MIRANDA'S CANNON  IS FROM THE USS SHARK,  I'LL NEED TO LEARN  ALL I CAN ABOUT THE SHIP,  STARTING WITH  ITS FINAL VOYAGE.
 I'M RETRACING  THE SHARK'S ROUTE  UP THE COLUMBIA RIVER  TO FORT VANCOUVER,  WHERE THE SHIP ANCHORED  WHEN IT FIRST ARRIVED  IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
 THE FORT, NOW IN  WASHINGTON STATE,  THEN OPERATED UNDER  AN ENGLISH CHARTER  AND BELONGED TO  THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY,  THE FIRST CORPORATION  IN NORTH AMERICA.
 GREG SHINE  IS CHIEF RANGER.
WELCOME TO FORT VANCOUVER.
HERE'S AN IMAGE OF THE SHARK.
THE SHARK WAS A SCHOONER, AND SHE WAS LAUNCHED IN 1821.
AND A FORE-AND-AFT RIGGED SCHOONER, WHICH MEANT IT HAD TWO MASTS HERE SLIGHTLY RAKED BACK.
 THE SHARK WAS  WELL-ARMED,  HAVING POLICED  WEST AFRICAN WATERS  AGAINST THE SLAVE TRADE,  SAFELY CONDUCTED FREED SLAVES  TO NEWLY FOUNDED LIBERIA,  AND PROTECTED  AMERICAN MERCHANTS  AGAINST PIRATES  IN THE CARIBBEAN.
BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY CANNONS IN THIS PICTURE.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SHE WAS CARRYING? YES, THE SHARK HAD TEN CARRONADES AND TWO LONG GUNS, AND THESE LITTLE OPEN AREAS HERE WERE CANNON PORTS.
 THIS EXPERIENCED SHIP  WAS CHOSEN TO SAIL  FOR THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST  IN 1846.
 AS THE U.S.
BORDER DISPUTE  WITH BRITAIN INTENSIFIED,  THE SHARK'S COMMANDER,  LT.
NEIL HOWISON,  WAS INSTRUCTED  TO RALLY AMERICANS  WITH A DISPLAY  OF THE FLAG,  SURVEY  THE OREGON TERRITORY,  AND TALK WITH BRITISH  AND AMERICAN HOMESTEADERS  LIVING THERE.
HIS ORDERS WERE VERY DIRECT: HE WAS TO COME IN TO OBTAIN THEIR DISPOSITION, WHETHER IT WAS FOR THE UNITED STATES OR FOR GREAT BRITAIN, AND ALSO TO REPORT ON THE AGRICULTURE, THE COMMERCE OF THE AREA, AND GIVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE OREGON COUNTRY.
 HOWISON KNEW A MISSTEP  COULD EASILY IGNITE TENSIONS  IN THE AREA.
 PRESIDENT POLK'S  DEMOCRATIC PARTY  WAS PUSHING TO LEGITIMIZE  AMERICAN SETTLEMENTS  ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
 ONLY A YEAR EARLIER,  IN 1845,  THIS DRIVE WAS DUBBED  MANIFEST DESTINY,  IMPLYING THAT IT  WAS GOD'S WILL  FOR THE UNITED STATES  TO EXPAND ACROSS THE CONTINENT  WEST TO THE PACIFIC,  SOUTH INTO LATIN AMERICA,  AND NORTH INTO  BRITISH CANADA.
 THIS BELIEF HELPED INFLAME  THE POLITICAL RALLYING CRY  OF 54-40 OR FIGHT,  A CALL TO EXTEND  AMERICA'S REACH  THROUGH BRITISH CANADA  ALL THE WAY  TO LATITUDE 54 DEGREES  AND 40 MINUTES.
 THE OREGON SETTLERS NEEDED  LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT.
THERE WERE CERTAINLY SOME AMERICAN SETTLERS THAT WERE HERE THAT WERE CROSSING THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND BEGINNING TO HOMESTEAD, OR, IN THE EYES OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY, JUMPED LAND CLAIMS THAT THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY HAD ESTABLISHED.
WHAT WAS THE BRITISH RESPONSE TO THE SHARK ARRIVING? THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY WELCOMED THE SHARK AND LT.
HOWISON AND WELCOMED AN AMERICAN SHIP INTO THE COLUMBIA RIVER BECAUSE THEY PROVIDED SOME LAW AND ORDER, REALLY, TO AN AREA THAT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH LAW AND ORDER.
 WITH THE LAND  AND TEMPERAMENT SURVEYED,  HOWISON SET SAIL  FOR SAN FRANCISCO  TO FILE HIS REPORT.
WHEN THEY LEFT FORT VANCOUVER, THEY WERE ALREADY BEHIND SCHEDULE.
THE WINTER CAN BE VERY FEROCIOUS, AND ESPECIALLY AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER NEAR THE COLUMBIA RIVER BAR.
 AS THE SHARK  HEADED FOR OPEN SEAS,  IT WRECKED ON  AN UNCHARTED SANDBAR  AT THE MOUTH  OF THE COLUMBIA.
LUCKILY, ALL OF THE PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE.
 GREG SHOWS ME HOWISON'S  REPORT TO THE U.S.
CONGRESS.
 ONE PASSAGE MAY RELATE DIRECTLY  TO MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY.
 IT SAYS HOWISON IS EAGER  TO RECOVER  THE SHIP'S  LOST WEAPONS.
RECEIVING INFORMATIONS THAT PART OF THE HULL WITH GUNS UPON IT HAD COME ASHORE, I SENT MIDSHIPMAN SIMES, AN ENTERPRISING YOUTH, TO VISIT THE SPOT.
 IN THE WATER  JUST OFF THE BEACH,  SIMES FOUND  A BROKEN SECTION OF DECK  WITH THREE OF THE SHARK'S  ONE-TON CARRONADES.
HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE ABOVE THE HIGH-WATER MARK, BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE INACCESSIBLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SURF.
 GREG SAYS  THE RESCUED CARRONADE  WAS DRAGGED  TOWARD THE SHORE  BUT HAD TO BE ABANDONED.
 IN 1898, IT WAS REDISCOVERED  AFTER A STORM  AND IS NOW ON EXHIBIT  AT THE CANNON BEACH  HISTORICAL SOCIETY MUSEUM.
 DID MIRANDA DISCOVER  ONE OF THE TWO  LEFT IN THE SURF? EOLOGIST  DENNIS GRIFFIN  SAYS THE COLUMBIA RIVER  WAS A NOTORIOUS GRAVEYARD  FOR HUNDREDS OF SHIPS,  NOT JUST THE SHARK.
WHAT WE SEE TODAY IS A SMALL GLIMPSE OF WHAT IT ONCE WAS.
IT WAS THE MIGHTY COLUMBIA BEFORE ALL THE DAMS.
BUT THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA WAS A VERY WICKED PLACE.
YOU HAD TIDES COMING UP THERE OR STORMS COMING UP THERE FROM 35 TO 50 FEET WAVES TO CRASH.
FIFTY FEET WAVES! HUGE WAVES.
THEY CALL THIS THE GRAVEYARD OF THE PACIFIC.
 THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER  WAS KNOWN TO BE DANGEROUS,  BUT DENNIS SAYS IF YOU WANTED  A PIECE OF THE REGION'S WEALTH,  YOU HAD TO RUN  THE COLUMBIA'S GAUNTLET.
YOU HAD THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY IN CANADA COMING ACROSS FOR FURS.
LOTS AND LOTS OF SALMON.
SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BIG CITIES, THEY NEEDED WOOD.
PEOPLE CAME UP THE COAST, FOUND LOTS OF TREES.
 ALL THAT SHIP TRAFFIC MEANT  A LOT OF WRECKS OVER THE YEARS.
OF THE 308 I KNOW, I HAVE 104 THAT I THINK WERE WRECKED EITHER AT THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA AND DOWN TO ARCH CAPE, IN THAT AREA.
NOW, OF THOSE 104, WE HAVE TO NARROW IT DOWN, WHICH ONES CARRIED CANNON, AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT, AND THAT'S A BIG IMPORTANT PART.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE ODDS THAT THE CANNONS WE HAVE ARE FROM THE SHARK? EVERYONE WANTS TO SAY IT'S THE SHARK.
I KNOW.
AND I'D LIKE TO THINK OF IT BEING THE SHARK, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.
 DENNIS SUGGESTS THE RECOVERED SHARK CARRONADE  COULD HELP RESOLVE  OUR MYSTERY.
 I'M MEETING COLUMBIA RIVER  MARITIME MUSEUM CURATOR  DAVID PEARSON  FOR A CLOSER LOOK.
SO THIS IS IT, THE CANNON THAT WAS FOUND IN 1898? THIS IS IT, RIGHT, JANUARY OF 1898.
 DAVE SAYS THIS CANNON WAS  RECOVERED ON THE SAME BEACH,  ABOUT 200 FEET FROM WHERE  MIRANDA MADE HER DISCOVERY.
WAS THIS THE ORIGINAL BASE, BY THE WAY? THIS ONE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS ACTUALLY A REPRODUCTION FROM NAVAL DRAWINGS THAT ARE WELL KNOWN.
 IF MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY  HAS A SIMILAR BASE,  THAT WOULD CONFIRM  IT'S A CARRONADE  FROM THE RIGHT ERA,  BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE SHARK  OR EVEN AN AMERICAN SHIP.
 THE CARRONADE WAS INVENTED  BY THE BRITISH FOR THEIR NAVY.
THEIR CARRONADE WAS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE DECK OF THE SHIP.
AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE PINNED AT THE FRONT OF IT AND THEN SWIVEL ON THAT PIN TO PREVENT IT FROM MOVING AROUND ON THE SHIP.
IT WAS THE OLD EXPRESSION, LOOSE CANNONS, AND THAT WAS EXACTLY IT, THAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU WANTED ON A SHIP HEAVING IN THE WAVES WAS A CANNON BOUNCING AROUND.
SO THE NAVY TOOK THE ADDITIONAL STEP AND WOULD ACTUALLY PIN THEM TO THE DECK.
 DAVE EXPLAINS  HOW THIS WORKED.
 A THREADED PIN AT THE BACK  OF THE BARREL  ADJUSTED THE TILT.
 THE BARREL WAS MOUNTED ON  A SMALL BASE, OR SLIDER,  WHICH FIT ONTO A LONGER  SLOTTED BOARD.
 THIS BOARD SAT ON ROLLERS  AT THE BACK  AND PIVOTED  AT THE FRONT.
 ANOTHER PIN BENEATH  THE CARRONADE  WENT FROM THE SLIDER  INTO THE SLOT.
 WHEN THE CARRONADE FIRED,  THIS CONTROLLED THE RECOIL.
 DAVE SAYS THE RECENT FINDS SHOW  SIMILARITIES TO THIS DESIGN.
THEY STILL HAVE THAT SLIDER ATTACHED TO IT, OR AT LEAST EVIDENCE OF THAT.
THAT BRINGS THE PROBABILITY OF THIS BEING A U.S.
NAVY SHIP MUCH, MUCH HIGHER IN OUR EYES.
 BUT WITH ALL THE CONCRETION  SURROUNDING MIRANDA'S OBJECT,  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE  A DEFINITIVE CONNECTION.
 MY INVESTIGATION  MIGHT BE AT AN END.
 BUT BECAUSE INTEREST  IN MIRANDA'S FIND IS HIGH,  I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SCHEDULE AN  X-RAY SESSION FOR THE CANNONS.
 I'M RETURNING TO NEHALEM BAY  TO MEET ROBERT NEYLAND,  HEAD OF THE UNDERWATER  ARCHEOLOGY BRANCH  OF THE NAVAL  HISTORICAL CENTER,  WHO WILL EXAMINE  THE X-RAYS.
THIS IS JUST A GENERIC CARRONADE.
 BOB TELLS ME  THESE WERE COMMON  ON MANY NAVY SHIPS  LIKE THE SHARK  IN THE FIRST HALF  OF THE 19th CENTURY.
IN A CLOSE-IN FIGHT, THEY WOULD DO MORE DAMAGE TO THE OPPOSING OR THE ENEMY SHIP AND DO MORE DAMAGE TO THE CREWS, TOO.
IT WOULD SMASH UP THE WOOD OR THE SHIP A LOT MORE.
 BECAUSE THIS SMALL CANNON  WAS A POPULAR WEAPON,  BOB SAYS MATCHING IT  TO THE SHARK WILL BE TOUGH.
 BUT ONCE THE X-RAYS  HAVE PENETRATED  MORE THAN 150 YEARS  OF DEPOSITS,  THEY MAY REVEAL  SOMETHING TELLING.
YOU COULD GET LUCKY AND ACTUALLY SEE A DATE MARKED ON THE GUNS AS WELL AS FOUNDRY MARKS.
YOU COULD GET LUCKY AND SEE THAT.
THAT'D BE VERY LUCKY.
YEAH, IT WOULD BE.
YOU KNOW, OR SAY U.S.
NAVY AS WELL, TOO.
 TO CAPTURE A GLIMPSE OF THE  OBJECT BENEATH THIS THICK MASS  REQUIRES AN EXTREMELY  HIGH-POWERED SYSTEM.
 A TEAM OF SPECIALISTS  IN NUCLEAR IMAGING  FROM FUJIFILM NDT  AND PSI INCORPORATED  ARE VOLUNTEERING  THEIR EXPERTISE TO HELP.
 BOB EXAMINES MIRANDA'S CANNON  TO PLAN THE X-RAYS.
HERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR PIN FOR THE CARRIAGE.
THIS APPEARS TO BE WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR BREACH RING, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF IT'S BROKEN OFF IF I'M CORRECT IN THAT.
THE SCREW, THE ELEVATING SCREW, SHOULD BE RIGHT IN HERE SOMEWHERE AS WELL, TOO.
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BACK OFF.
IT'S GOING TO GET REAL HOT RIGHT HERE.
 THE FILM NEEDS TO BE EXPOSED  FOR NEARLY 90 MINUTES  TO CAPTURE ENOUGH DETAIL.
 WHEN ALL OF THE EXPOSURES  ARE FINALLY COMPLETE,  WE TAKE THE X-RAY PLATES  INSIDE TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE.
STILL NOT GETTING ANYTHING, HUH? I CAN SEE A LITTLE MORE.
 THE FIRST IMAGE  REVEALS LITTLE.
 THE SECOND PLATE IS  ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER,  BUT IT DOES OUTLINE  THE SHAPE OF A CANNON BARREL.
IN THIS SHOT, WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE BORE, WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THE BANDING AROUND THE GUN...
 THE BANDING KEPT THE BARREL  FROM RUPTURING WHEN FIRED.
 WE'RE DOWN  TO THE LAST PLATE.
THAT IS A GREAT SHOT.
NOW WE'RE TALKING.
 IT'S TIME TO GIVE  MIRANDA HER ANSWER.
I HAVE DONE ALL THE RESEARCH THAT WAS POSSIBLE ON THE CANNON THAT YOU FOUND.
BUT THIS IS NOT JUST A CANNON, IT'S A CERTAIN KIND OF CANNON CALLED A CARRONADE THAT WAS ON U.S.
NAVY SHIPS IN THE EARLY HALF OF THE 19th CENTURY.
 I TELL MIRANDA ABOUT  THE USS SHARK'S ROLE  IN THE SHAPING  OF AMERICA'S BORDERS  AND ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS.
 ONLY VERY POWERFUL X-RAYS  COULD PEER DEEP  INTO THE MASS OF SEDIMENT  AND RUSTED METAL  TO REVEAL WHAT LIES  UNDERNEATH.
SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE? THERE'S YOUR SCREW.
EXCELLENT.
I GUESS THIS IS THE THREADING ON IT, RIGHT? YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE YOU'VE STILL GOT THE THREADS VERY VISIBLE IN HERE.
OH, THAT'S WHERE YOU'D CRANK IT, OKAY.
THE LOOP HERE FOR THE BREACH ROPE, A LONG GUN WOULDN'T HAVE THAT.
THE ELEVATING SCREW, A LONG GUN WOULD NOT HAVE AN ELEVATING SCREW.
IT'S DEFINITELY A CARRONADE.
BUT IT ALSO COMPARES VERY FAVORABLY TO THE CANNON THAT WAS RECOVERED IN THE 1890s AND IS NOW AN EXHIBIT, SO SUGGESTING IT IS THE SAME TIME OF CANNON, PERHAPS FROM THE SAME SHIP.
I DON'T SEE ANYWHERE WHERE IT SAYS USS SHARK OR U.S.
NAVY, BUT THIS IS ALL CONSISTENT WITH THE CARRONADE.
SO FAR, CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, IT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'D EXPECT TO SEE FOR A CARRONADE FROM THE SHARK.
AND HERE IS AN X-RAY OF THE PART OF THE CANNON THAT WOULD GO INTO THE DECK THERE.
YOU WOULD SCREW IT TO LIFT IT UP.
THAT'S AWESOME.
THANK YOU.
ALL THE PEOPLE AGREE THAT WHILE WE'LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE, YOU PROBABLY FOUND THE CANNON THAT WAS ON THE USS SHARK.
NICE, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
DON'T YOU FEEL PROUD ABOUT THAT? YEAH, THAT'S COOL.
YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T JUST GIVE US A CRITICAL PART OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF OREGON BUT TELLS US ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
WOW, ONE CANNON.
YEAH.
 THE GREAT IRONY  OF THE SHARK'S STORY  WAS THAT A TREATY  ENDING THE DISPUTE  OVER THE CANADIAN BORDER  WAS SIGNED IN JUNE OF 1846,  ONE MONTH BEFORE THE SHARK  ARRIVED AT THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
 NEWS DIDN'T REACH  LIEUTENANT HOWISON  UNTIL A MONTH  AFTER THE SHARK SANK.
 THE OREGON TREATY SET  THE U.S./CANADIAN BORDER  AT THE 49th PARALLEL,  WHERE IT REMAINS TODAY.
SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST FASCINATING HISTORICAL OBJECTS HAVE EMERGED FROM THE DEEP.
OCEANS, RIVERS, AND LAKES ARE TOMBS FOR AN INCALCULABLE WEALTH OF OBJECTS.
ALTHOUGH UNDERWATER RECOVERY IS NOT ALWAYS EASY, ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE MADE MARITIME ARCHEOLOGY AN EXCITING NEW FRONTIER FOR HISTORIANS.
IN 1943, JACQUES COUSTEAU AND EMILE GAGNON REVOLUTIONIZED UNDERWATER EXPLORATION WITH THEIR AQUA-LUNG, A SELF-CONTAINED UNDERWATER BREATHING APPARATUS.
THIS SCUBA DEVICE ALLOWED HUMANS TO FREELY DIVE TO DEPTHS OF 180 FEET.
THE NEXT GREAT ADVANCE WAS TITANIUM-REINFORCED SUBMERSIBLES, WHICH COULD PROBE TWO AND A HALF MILES BELOW SEA LEVEL.
IN 1985, AN UNMANNED SUBMERSIBLE FINALLY MADE CONTACT WITH THE TITANIC.
THE NOTION THAT A GREAT GASH HAD RIPPED THE SHIP IN TWO WAS NOW DEBUNKED.
IN 2002, ONE OF HISTORY'S MOST SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERIES WAS MADE BY SHEER ACCIDENT.
OFF INDIA'S COAST, OCEANOGRAPHERS UNEARTHED WHAT COULD BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST CIVILIZATIONS.
SCIENTISTS USED SONAR TO IDENTIFY HUGE GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES DATING BACK 10,000 YEARS.
Elyse:  OUR NEXT STORY  INVESTIGATES  A CONNECTICUT FARMHOUSE  WITH AN UNSETTLED PAST.
 AS THE 20th CENTURY DAWNS,  AMERICA'S CITIES  ARE INDUSTRIALIZING  AND GROWING AT  AN EXPLOSIVE RATE.
 THEY'RE BEING FILLED  BY A TIDAL WAVE  OF IMMIGRANTS FROM EUROPE  AND NATIVE-BORN AMERICANS  WHO ARE ABANDONING  THEIR FAMILY FARMS  FOR THE OPPORTUNITY  AND BETTER WAGES  OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.
 MORE THAN 100 YEARS LATER,  CHRIS REMY OF EAST HADDAM,  CONNECTICUT,  BELIEVES HIS HOME  MAY SOMEHOW BE CONNECTED  TO THIS DRAMATIC PERIOD  IN AMERICA'S PAST.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF MY HOUSE, WHO WERE THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED HERE.
HI.
I'M ELYSE.
CHRIS, COME ON IN.
WHAT A GREAT HOUSE.
THANK YOU.
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU OWNED IT? WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE SIX YEARS AGO.
IT'S FIVE ACRES, PART OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY A 60-ACRE FARM.
THIS IS THE MAP FROM WHEN THEY SUBDIVIDED IT BACK IN THE '70s, AND HERE'S OUR FIVE-ACRE PLOT RIGHT HERE.
WHAT SPARKED YOUR INTEREST IN DOING RESEARCH? WELL, I KNEW THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN 1804, OBVIOUSLY, WHEN I BOUGHT IT, SO I WANTED TO RESEARCH WHAT I COULD FIND OUT, WHO BUILT IT AND WHEN, AND WHO'S LIVED HERE.
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT? WELL, I FOUND OUT THAT AROUND THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY, THE PROPERTY SEEMED TO CHANGE HANDS A LOT OF TIMES -
EVERY YEAR, EVERY TWO YEARS -
FOR A GOOD 15, 20 YEARS, AND THEY SEEMED TO HAVE RUSSIAN AND EASTERN-EUROPEAN NAMES.
WHAT SPECIFICALLY DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT? I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE, WHAT WERE THEY DOING HERE...
MM-HMM.
AND WHY DID THE PROPERTY CHANGE HANDS SO MANY TIMES IN SUCH A SHORT TIME FRAME? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME TO GO ON? WELL, WHEN I WAS DOING SOME REMODELING ON THE HOUSE, INSIDE THE WALLS, I FOUND THIS OLD WALLPAPER.
ON THE OTHER SIDE IS NEWSPAPER WITH HEBREW CHARACTERS.
AND AT THE TOP OF THIS PAGE YOU CAN SEE IT'S THE JEWISH  MORNING JOURNAL.
WELL, I'M GOING TO GO WALK OUTSIDE AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND, AND THEN I GUESS I'M OFF TO THE TOWN HALL.
OKAY.
 I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED  IN THIS STORY.
 MY OWN FAMILY ARRIVED  FROM EASTERN EUROPE  AND SETTLED IN NEW YORK CITY  AND BALTIMORE, MARYLAND,  THREE GENERATIONS AGO.
 BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY SO MANY  EASTERN-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS -
 IF THAT'S WHAT  THEY WERE -
 ROTATED THROUGH THIS FARMHOUSE  AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.
 MY FIRST STOP  IS TOWN HALL.
 THERE ARE LAND DEEDS HERE  GOING BACK TWO CENTURIES.
 BEFORE I SCOUR  THESE BOUND RECORDS,  I WANT TO LEARN MORE  ABOUT THE OLD NEWSPAPERS  FROM INSIDE THE WALLS  OF THE HOUSE.
 THE JEWISH MORNING JOURNAL WAS APPARENTLY AN ULTRA-ORTHODOX NEWSPAPER THAT STARTED PRINTING IN THE UNITED STATES IN NEW YORK CITY IN 1902.
LISTEN TO THIS: THE PAPER WASN'T WRITTEN IN HEBREW, IT WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN YIDDISH.
YIDDISH IS WRITTEN WITH HEBREW CHARACTERS, BUT IT IS DIFFERENT.
IT'S DERIVED FROM THE GERMAN LANGUAGE.
THERE'S PROBABLY ONLY A QUARTER-MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY THAT SPEAK YIDDISH, INCLUDING MY GRANDMOTHER.
 I KNOW FROM HER  THAT BACK THEN,  THE LANGUAGE  WAS SPOKEN WIDELY  AMONG JEWISH IMMIGRANTS  FROM EASTERN EUROPE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT THE LAND DEEDS CAN TELL US.
 HERE'S THE FIRST RECORD  OF THE SALE OF THE LAND.
ON JULY 17, 1798, JUSTIN WORTHINGTON SOLD THE LAND TO CIRUS WILLEY.
 THE FARM STAYED IN  THE SAME HANDS  FOR MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS  OF A CENTURY.
 THE WILLEY FAMILY  SOLD THE FARM IN 1878,  AND THE REAL ESTATE  TRANSACTIONS LOOK PRETTY NORMAL  UNTIL 1891.
ON JUNE 15, 1891, IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAND WAS SOLD TO DAVID DINSON.
 ONLY FOUR MONTHS LATER,  DINSON SELLS THE FARM  TO LEWIS NAMEROV  AND LOUIS NATESZON  OF NEW YORK CITY.
 JUST NINE MONTHS AFTER THAT,  IT'S SOLD AGAIN.
 BETWEEN 1891 AND 1906, THE  FARM CHANGES HANDS SIX TIMES:  DINSON,  NAMEROV AND NATESZON,  MALLER, BOOX,  KATZ AND KURRIER,  RITTER AND AZWOLENSKY.
 AND THE SALE PRICE  OFTEN INCLUDED LIVESTOCK  AND VARIOUS  FARM EQUIPMENT.
 SOMETHING ELSE APPEARS  TO LINK THE FAMILIES  WHO PASSED THROUGH  CHRIS'S HOME.
A FEW OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE MORTGAGES FROM THE SAME LENDERS, THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND AND THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY, BOTH NEW YORK CORPORATIONS.
 CENSUS RECORDS CONFIRM SEVERAL  OF THE FARM'S EARLY OWNERS  WERE FROM RUSSIA.
MAX AND GUSSIE MALLER, OR MULLER AS IT'S WRITTEN IN THE CENSUS, CAME TO AMERICA FROM RUSSIA IN 1886.
AND THE ENTIRE RITTER FAMILY WAS BORN IN RUSSIA, ALSO.
SO FAR, I HAVE RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS MOVING FROM NEW YORK CITY, I HAVE A YIDDISH PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NEW YORK CITY, AND I HAVE LOANS GIVEN BY TWO CORPORATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY.
EVERYTHING IS POINTING TO MANHATTAN.
 I'M MEETING IMMIGRATION  HISTORIAN DANIEL SAWYER  AT NEW YORK'S LOWER EAST SIDE  TENEMENT MUSEUM.
DANIEL, I'M INVESTIGATING THIS FARMHOUSE THAT'S IN CONNECTICUT, AND IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY, THERE WAS A LOT OF TURNOVER.
THE PEOPLE WERE GENERALLY COMING FROM NEW YORK CITY, AND THERE WERE TWO NAMES ON THE MORTGAGE THAT I KEPT SEEING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
THERE WAS THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND AND THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY.
WELL, THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND WAS SET UP IN 1891 BY BARON MAURICE de HIRSCH, WHO WAS A EUROPEAN JEWISH PHILANTHROPIST, IN ORDER TO HELP THE EASTERN-EUROPEAN JEWISH IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES TO GET ESTABLISHED IN THEIR NEW HOME.
 DANIEL EXPLAINS THAT  IN MARCH 1881,  THE ASSASSINATION OF THE  RUSSIAN CZAR ALEXANDER II  TRIGGERED A MASSIVE JEWISH  MIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES.
THERE WAS A POPULAR FEELING THAT THE JEWS HAD BEEN BEHIND THIS, AND SO THERE WAS A WAVE OF POGROMS, WHICH WERE ANTI-JEWISH RIOTS, IN WHICH MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MUCH PROPERTY WAS DESTROYED.
 OVER THE NEXT DECADE,  MORE THAN 200,000  EASTERN-EUROPEAN JEWS  FLOODED INTO THE MAIN  EAST COAST PORTS,  PARTICULARLY NEW YORK.
 BY THE TURN  OF THE CENTURY,  MORE THAN HALF A MILLION  HAD ARRIVED.
SO THEY CAME HERE SEEKING A BETTER LIFE.
ABSOLUTELY.
CAME HERE SEEKING JOBS AND A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING.
 MANY OF THESE JEWISH  REFUGEES SETTLED  IN NEW YORK CITY'S  LOWER EAST SIDE,  SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE  WHO SHARED  A COMMON BACKGROUND,  FAITH, AND LANGUAGE.
 BUT DANIEL EXPLAINS THAT  PACKED INTO THE SLUMS OF ONE  OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED  NEIGHBORHOODS ON EARTH,  THE NEW ARRIVALS ALSO  FOUND THEMSELVES AT ODDS  WITH THE ESTABLISHED  AMERICANIZED JEWISH COMMUNITY.
THEY HAD A VERY AMBIVALENT FEELING TOWARDS THESE NEWCOMERS.
ON THE ONE HAND, THEY FELT A KINSHIP WITH THESE PEOPLE AND WANTED TO HELP.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY WERE FOREIGN, THEY SPOKE YIDDISH, THEY WERE POOR, AND THE ESTABLISHED JEWISH COMMUNITY WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD REFLECT BADLY ON THEM, AND SO THEY FELT AN ADDED IMPETUS TO HELP PEOPLE ESTABLISH THEMSELVES, AMERICANIZE, AND GET ESTABLISHED ECONOMICALLY AS WELL.
HOW DOES THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND AND THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY FIT INTO ALL OF THIS? THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY WAS A SPIN-OFF OF THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND, WHICH PROVIDED PEOPLE WITH MORTGAGES WHEN THEY WANTED TO GET SET UP AS FARMERS ON THE LAND AND WITH HOUSES.
 HE SAYS OUR DEED HOLDERS  WERE PART OF A PLAN  TO EASE OVERCROWDING  BY RELOCATING JEWS  OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY,  WHERE THEY COULD EARN  A LIVING OFF THE LAND.
 BUT HE CAN'T  SHED ANY LIGHT  ON WHO OUR RUSSIAN  IMMIGRANTS WERE  OR WHY SO MANY SEEMED  TO HAVE STAYED  FOR SUCH A BRIEF PERIOD  AT CHRIS'S FARMHOUSE.
 THE CENTER  FOR JEWISH HISTORY  HOUSES THE PAPERS  OF THE BARON'S FUND  AND THE JEWISH  AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.
 IN A VOLUME ABOUT  THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS  FACING RUSSIAN JEWS AT  THE TURN OF THE 19th CENTURY,  I DISCOVER THE JEWISH  AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY,  OR J.A.S., SET FAMILIES  UP ON FARMLAND  ALL ACROSS NEW ENGLAND.
INDIVIDUAL JEWISH FARMERS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE NEW ENGLAND STATES AND OWN FARMS IN RHODE ISLAND, MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT, MAINE, VERMONT, AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.
BY FAR THE GREATEST NUMBER ARE LOCATED IN CONNECTICUT, AND THEY HAVE FORMED THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION OF THE JEWISH FARMING COMMUNITY IN NEW ENGLAND.
THIS IS A LEDGER BOOK THAT LISTS LOANS FROM THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND.
LET'S SEE...
AH, CONNECTICUT.
 ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO INFORMATION  ON OUR FAMILIES,  THE ORIGINAL  LOAN APPLICATIONS  DESCRIBE HOW THE  LENDING PROCESS WORKED.
 SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS  WERE RUSSIAN JEWS  WHO WERE HEALTHY ENOUGH  TO HANDLE FARM WORK  AND WHO ALSO HAD A LITTLE BIT  OF MONEY TO GET STARTED.
 FOR THOSE  WHO DIDN'T QUALIFY,  THE FUND PROVIDED  TRADE SCHOOLS, ENGLISH CLASSES,  AND SCHOLARSHIPS  FOR STUDENTS IN THE CITY.
BUT I'M NOT FINDING ANY INFORMATION ON OUR FARMERS.
HI.
HI, ELYSE.
 I'M MEETING CONNECTICUT  HISTORIAN BRIANN GREENFIELD  AT THE STATE ARCHIVES.
 SHE EXPLAINS WHY CONNECTICUT  WAS SUCH A POPULAR CHOICE  FOR THE IMMIGRANT FARMERS.
WELL, THE SHORT ANSWER IS AVAILABLE LAND.
A LOT OF OLD YANKEE FARMERS WERE MOVING AWAY FROM THE FARMS.
THEY WERE BEING PULLED OUT WEST, WHERE AGRICULTURE WAS MORE PRODUCTIVE, OR THEY WERE COMING TO THE FACTORY JOBS THAT WERE AVAILABLE IN THE CITY.
 BRIANN TELLS ME THAT  THE STATE WORRIED  ABOUT THE ABANDONED FARM  PROBLEM  AND THE DECLINE  OF RURAL COMMUNITIES.
 IN 1892, THEY BEGAN TO PUBLISH  LISTS OF FARMS FOR SALE.
THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF FARMS FOR SALE IN CONNECTICUT THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1899.
SO IT'S A REAL ESTATE LISTING? THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
THEY HAVE MAPS, AND THERE ARE SOME PICTURES IN HERE AS WELL.
THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE KINDS OF FARMS THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT.
THERE'S EVEN SOME IN EAST HADDAM.
 BRIANN EXPLAINS  THE RUSSIAN JEWS  WEREN'T THE ONLY NEWCOMERS  SETTLING THE OLD YANKEE FARMS.
IT WAS ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT GROUPS, AND THIS WAS A PERIOD OF HEAVY IMMIGRATION.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ARTICLE.
ALIEN INVASION OF CONNECTICUT FARMS.
EVERY THIRD FARM IN CONNECTICUT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF A MAN OF FOREIGN BIRTH.
THERE IS NO CORNER OF THE STATE INTO WHICH THE IMMIGRANT FOREIGNER HAS NOT PENETRATED AND THAT HE COMES FROM LANDS THE POLES APART IN CUSTOMS, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, AND MORALITY.
THAT SEEMS PRETTY NEGATIVE TO ME.
WELL, TO BE VERY HONEST, I THINK THEY SAW IT AS BOTH A BLESSING AND AS A THREAT.
A BLESSING BECAUSE THEY NEEDED AGRICULTURAL LABOR, BUT ALSO A THREAT BECAUSE PEOPLE FEARED THE LOSS OF YANKEE CULTURE.
 THE FAMILIES WHO LIVED  IN CHRIS'S HOME  SWAPPED THE OVERCROWDING  AND CLASS TENSION  OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY  IN NEW YORK  FOR THE XENOPHOBIA  OF THE YANKEES IN CONNECTICUT.
 DOES THAT EXPLAIN  WHY THE ARRIVALS  ONLY STAYED FOR  SUCH A SHORT TIME?  MARY DONOHUE IS  AN ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIAN  WITH THE CONNECTICUT COMMISSION  ON CULTURE AND TOURISM.
HI, MARY, ELYSE.
HI.
LET'S HEAD IN HERE.
MARY, I'M INVESTIGATING A FARMHOUSE IN CONNECTICUT THAT DURING THE EARLY 20th CENTURY HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TURNOVER WITH RUSSIAN JEWS, AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY.
WELL, THEY SETTLED ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN IN A VERY JEWISH AREA, BUT THEN TO MOVE TO THE COUNTRY WAS A VERY HARD MOVE.
SUDDENLY, THEY'RE IN THE CONNECTICUT COUNTRYSIDE, WHERE THERE'S NOT A READY-MADE JEWISH COMMUNITY, THEY DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH -
THAT MADE IT HARDER.
 BUT MARY DOUBTS  RESENTMENT OF THE NEWCOMERS  WAS THE REASON  FOR THE HIGH TURNOVER.
I THINK IF THE JEWISH FARMERS WORKED HARD AND BECAME SUCCESSFUL, THEY REALLY HAD THE YANKEE FARMERS' RESPECT.
 BUT IF IT WASN'T  XENOPHOBIA,  WHY WEREN'T THE FAMILIES  WHO LIVED IN CHRIS'S FARMHOUSE  ABLE TO MAKE A GO  OF IT? THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH CAME THROUGH IN 1908.
 WHAT MARY TELLS ME NEXT  PUTS ALL THE PIECES  OF THE PUZZLE IN PLACE.
 IT'S TIME TO HEAD BACK  TO CHRIS.
CHRIS, I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND OUT A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED HERE, BUT YOU WERE RIGHT, THEY WERE RUSSIAN JEWS.
THAT'S GREAT.
PRETTY COOL, RIGHT? PRETTY COOL.
 I TELL CHRIS HOW,  WITH THE HELP OF ORGANIZATIONS  LIKE THE JEWISH  AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY,  IMMIGRANTS ESCAPED FROM  THE SLUMS OF NEW YORK CITY  TO FARMS SUCH AS HIS.
BUT WHEN THEY GOT HERE, IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY.
THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TRAINING AS FARMERS, AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE REFUGEES.
THEY WERE IN THE TRADES, THEY WERE PROFESSIONALS, THEY WERE ALMOST ANYTHING BUT A FARMER.
YOU WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO OWN LAND IN RUSSIA IF YOU WERE JEWISH.
IT WAS ALSO VERY MARGINAL LAND.
CONNECTICUT POTATOES ARE REALLY ROCKS.
THIS IS FARMLAND THAT'S BEEN USED HARD FOR OVER 200 YEARS.
 MANY SIMPLY  COULDN'T MAKE IT,  AND THE OLD YANKEE FARMS  KEPT CHANGING HANDS.
WOW, THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED.
WELL, I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH TURNOVER.
THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND DECIDED TO GIVE UP.
 BUT THE STORY  DOESN'T END THERE.
 MARY EXPLAINED THAT  THE ORGANIZATIONS  THAT HELPED  BUY THE FARMS  REALIZED THE EARLY IMMIGRANTS  NEEDED FURTHER ASSISTANCE.
THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH CAME THROUGH IN 1908 WHEN THEY ALSO STARTED TO PRODUCE A NEWSPAPER IN YIDDISH FOR FARMERS CALLED THE JEWISH FARMER, WHICH WAS THE FIRST YIDDISH AGRICULTURAL MAGAZINE IN THE WORLD.
 MARY'S FRIEND AVI  HAS AGREED TO HELP TRANSLATE  SOME OF THE YIDDISH.
ALL RIGHT, HELP US OUT HERE.
AND THE FIRST ARTICLE YOU HAVE IS HOW TO BEST UNDERSTAND YOUR COW, OR...
[ speaks in Yiddish ] AND THEN IT GOES ON TO SAY IN YIDDISH WHAT EVERY FARMER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEIR COW.
[ speaking in Yiddish ] EVERY JEWISH FARMER WHO HAS EYES HAS NOTICED THAT SOME COWS GIVE MILK BETTER AND SOME COWS GIVE MILK WORSE.
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS THIS HOW-TO GUIDE FOR JEWISH FARMERS, EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO BE A FARMER, ALL THE BASICS, WRITTEN IN YIDDISH.
MARY, WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM THE JEWISH FARMER, HOW DID THEY DO? THEY DID GREAT.
IN 1908, IT ONLY HAD 638 SUBSCRIBERS, AND FIVE YEARS LATER, IT HAD THOUSANDS.
IN CONNECTICUT, JEWISH FARMERS DEVELOPED A NICHE MARKET FOR THINGS LIKE TOBACCO, POULTRY, EGGS, DAIRY, AND SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION JEWISH FARMERS REALLY PROSPERED.
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MAKE IT AND THEY WENT BACK TO THE CITY, BUT OTHER PEOPLE WERE SMART AND THEY FOUND OTHER WAYS TO MAKE MONEY, AND THEY TURNED THEIR FARMS INTO EITHER BOARDING HOUSES OR WEEKEND RESORTS, SO MUCH SO, THAT AT ONE TIME, THIS AREA WAS CALLED THE CATSKILLS OF NEW ENGLAND.
THE IDEA THAT THIS HOUSE WAS MORE THAN A HOUSE, THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SANCTUARY FOR PEOPLE, I MEAN, THAT'S JUST FANTASTIC.
WELL, IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.

THE TOWN OF WILLIAMSBURG IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, ALSO SAW AN INFLUX OF JEWISH RESIDENTS AT THE TURN OF THE 20th CENTURY THANKS TO AN INCREDIBLE FEAT OF AMERICAN ENGINEERING.
CONSTRUCTION ON THE WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE, NEW YORK'S SECOND GREAT SUSPENSION BRIDGE, BEGAN ON NOVEMBER 7th, 1896.
TO ALLEVIATE THE TRAFFIC OVERWHELMING THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, ITS DESIGN CALLED FOR A DOUBLE-DECKER ROADWAY FOR CARRIAGES, TROLLEYS, AND PEDESTRIANS.
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT TWO LEVELS OF TRAFFIC, 310-FOOT-HIGH TOWERS WERE ERECTED, THE FIRST EVER MADE ENTIRELY OF STEEL.
BUILT IN HALF THE TIME OF THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AND MEASURING FOUR AND A HALF FEET LONGER, THE WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE STOLE THE TITLE OF THE LONGEST SUSPENSION BRIDGE IN THE WORLD WHEN IT OPENED ON DECEMBER 19, 1903.
JEWISH RESIDENTS OF MANHATTAN'S CROWDED EAST SIDE TENEMENTS STREAMED OVER THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART BRIDGE TO FIND NEW HOMES IN SPACIOUS BROOKLYN.
THE BRAND-NEW LINK BETWEEN THE THEN-SEPARATE CITIES OF NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN ALSO PROVIDED A FINAL IMPETUS FOR THEM TO CONSOLIDATE.
IN 1898, THEY JOINED WITH QUEENS, STATEN ISLAND, AND THE BRONX TO BECOME THE SINGLE UNITED CITY OF NEW YORK.
Tukufu:  OUR LAST STORY INVESTIGATES  THE CONNECTION  BETWEEN A PORTRAIT, A POET,  AND THE FALL OF AN EMPIRE.
 IN 1923, THE LEBANESE-BORN  POET KHALIL GIBRAN  PUBLISHES THE PROPHET,  A COLLECTION OF POEMS  EXPLORING FACETS OF LIFE  AND THE HUMAN CONDITION.
 ALTHOUGH VIEWED SKEPTICALLY  BY CRITICS,  IT WILL BECOME  A LITERARY SENSATION,  MAKING KHALIL GIBRAN ONE OF  THE WORLD'S BESTSELLING POETS  AND HAVING  A POWERFUL IMPACT  ON THE COUNTERCULTURE OF THE  1960s AND THE NEW-AGE MOVEMENT.
 BUT MANY ARE UNAWARE  THAT THE WRITER  WAS ALSO  A PROLIFIC PAINTER,  CAPTURING CELEBRITIES  AND FAMOUS FIGURES  OF THE 20th CENTURY  ON CANVAS.
 NOW, ALMOST EIGHT DECADES  AFTER GIBRAN'S DEATH,  BOB DIAB FROM OVERLAND PARK,  KANSAS, HAS A PORTRAIT  THAT HE THINKS MAY HAVE BEEN  PAINTED BY GIBRAN.
[ doorbell rings ] HELLO, I'M TUKUFU.
I'M BOB.
PLEASE COME IN.
WOW, SO WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER, NAJEEB MUSA DIAB.
HE WAS A PUBLISHER OF AN ARABIC NEWSPAPER IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.
JUST AFTER HE IMMIGRATED HERE FROM SYRIA.
AND WHICH PAPER WAS THAT? IT WAS CALLED  THE MIRROR OF THE WEST.
 BOB SAYS HIS  GRANDFATHER'S NEWSPAPER  WAS ONCE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE  FOR ARAB IMMIGRANTS,  A FAMILIAR VOICE  REPORTING ON CHANGING EVENTS  IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES  AND ON LIFE WITHIN  ARAB IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES  IN THE UNITED STATES.
 HE PUBLISHED GIBRAN'S POEMS  IN HIS NEWSPAPER,  GIVING THE POET  A PROMINENT VOICE  IN THE ISOLATED  ARAB COMMUNITY.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PAINTING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT? THE STORY IS THAT IT WAS PAINTED BY KHALIL GIBRAN.
NOW, I KNOW OF HIM AS A VERY FAMOUS WRITER, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HE DID PAINTINGS.
YES.
ESPECIALLY PORTRAITS.
YES.
AND I KNOW THAT HE...
 BOB TELLS ME A COUSIN  HE HASN'T SEEN IN MANY YEARS  ONCE HAD A DRAWING  SIGNED BY THE POET.
 ALTHOUGH THE PAINTING  OF BOB'S GRANDFATHER  IS NOT SIGNED, THERE ARE  SOME POTENTIAL CLUES.
WHAT IS THIS MEDAL HERE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT? I DO NOT KNOW.
AND THIS HERE, THIS IS A WATCH, RIGHT?  BOB HAS A TIMEPIECE  THAT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN  THROUGH HIS FAMILY  WHICH HE THINKS MAY BE  THE SAME WATCH  IN THE PAINTING.
THIS POCKET WATCH WAS PRESENTED TO MY GRANDFATHER WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY IN 1914 TO 1915.
FINE TIMEPIECE.
THANK YOU.
 BOB SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH  HIS GRANDFATHER  IMMIGRATED TO  THE UNITED STATES,  HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE  TO THE CAUSE OF INDEPENDENCE  FOR SYRIA AND LEBANON.
 BOTH WERE STILL PART  OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE,  WHICH HAD RULED THOSE LANDS  FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT FOR YOU? WELL, COULD IT HAVE BEEN PAINTED BY KHALIL GIBRAN AND ANY BACKGROUND ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER.
 THE PORTRAIT IS TOO LARGE  TO CARRY WITH ME,  SO I'M GOING TO TAKE  SOME PHOTOS.
 I READ KHALIL GIBRAN  IN COLLEGE,  BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH  ABOUT HIS ARTWORK.
 I'M HEADING INTO BROOKLYN,  NEW YORK, HOME TO A LARGE  AND LONG-STANDING  ARAB-AMERICAN COMMUNITY,  TO SHOW BOB'S PAINTING  TO A KHALIL GIBRAN SCHOLAR,  GREGORY ORFALEA.
WELCOME.
 GREG SAYS MUCH OF GIBRAN'S  WRITING AND PAINTING  REFLECTS HIS IDENTITY  AS AN IMMIGRANT  IN A FOREIGN LAND.
I THINK HIS EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA WAS ONE OF ALIENATION.
IT WAS A LONELY EXPERIENCE LINGUISTICALLY.
HE DIDN'T KNOW ENGLISH.
HE WAS NOT IN BEAUTIFUL, VERDANT, SNOWY MT.
LEBANON, HE WAS LIVING IN THE TENEMENTS IN GRIMY BOSTON, SOUTH BOSTON, WEST ROXBURY.
 GREG EXPLAINS THAT GIBRAN  ARRIVED IN BOSTON IN 1895  AT THE AGE OF 12.
 HIS FAMILY WAS PART  OF AN ENORMOUS INFLUX  OF MOSTLY POOR IMMIGRANTS  WHO ARRIVED  AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY  FROM LEBANON AND SYRIA  TO PLACES SUCH AS  BROOKLYN, NEW YORK,  AND SOUTH BOSTON.
 HIS FIRST POETRY  WAS IN ARABIC  AND OFTEN ADDRESSED YOUNG  IMMIGRANTS LIKE HIMSELF  STRUGGLING TO FIND THEIR WAY  IN THE UNITED STATES.
HE WROTE POEMS TO TELL YOUNG SYRIAN AMERICANS TO BE PROUD OF THEIR HERITAGE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FEEL THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO GIVE OF MAGNITUDE.
 IN 1923, HE PUBLISHED  A COLLECTION  OF 26 ENGLISH PROSE POEMS  ABOUT A MYSTICAL SPIRITUAL  LEADER, THE PROPHET.
 IN IT, GIBRAN EXPLORED SUBJECTS  LIKE LOVE, BEAUTY, AND GIVING.
 YOU GIVE BUT LITTLE WHEN  YOU GIVE OF YOUR POSSESSIONS.
 IT IS WHEN YOU GIVE OF YOURSELF  THAT YOU TRULY GIVE.
 THE UNIQUE BLEND OF EAST  AND WEST THINKING  HAS SOLD MILLIONS  OF COPIES.
THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THE PROPHET THAT ARE VERY INTERESTING, AND SOME OF THE APHORISMS THAT ARE DIFFERENT.
WORK IS LOVE MADE VISIBLE.
IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STYLE OF WRITING THAN WAS GOING ON RIGHT THEN AND THERE WITH THE AMERICANS.
 BUT GREG BELIEVES THAT,  IRONICALLY, THE PROPHET'S COMMERCIAL  SUCCESS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED  TO GIBRAN'S MIXED REVIEWS  FROM CRITICS.
AND ALSO YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT ANOTHER REASON WAS THAT THEY JUST SIMPLY DID NOT TRANSLATE HIS TOUGHER, MORE REBELLIOUS, PRINCIPLED POLITICAL WORK THAT WAS PUBLISHED PRIOR TO THE PROPHET.
WE TRANSLATED A POEM OF HIS THAT HAD NEVER SEEN ENGLISH, DEFEAT, MY DEFEAT.
THAT MATERIAL SHOWS A MORE POLITICAL, MORE DEFIANT, MORE SOCIALLY ENGAGED GIBRAN.
I'LL READ JUST A BIT OF IT.
DEFEAT, MY DEFEAT, MY SHINING SWORD AND SHIELD.
IN YOUR EYES I HAVE READ THAT TO BE ENTHRONED IS TO BE ENSLAVED, AND WE SHALL STAND IN THE SUN WITH A WILL AND WE SHALL BE DANGEROUS.
SALMA JAYYUSI, THE PALESTINIAN CRITIC, SAYS THAT HE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LITERARY FIGURE IN THE ARAB WORLD IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20th CENTURY.
THAT'S BIG.
 I TELL GREG ABOUT  MY INVESTIGATION.
SO I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KHALIL GIBRAN AND NAJEEB DIAB.
CAN YOU TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DIAB? WELL, HE WAS A LEADER OF THE COMMUNITY AS A JOURNALIST.
HE WAS A LEADER OF THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY.
IT WAS FOR FREEDOM FOR SYRIA FROM OTTOMAN TURKEY.
HE WAS A HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN.
 GREG CONFIRMS BOTH MEN  KNEW EACH OTHER  AND MOVED  IN SIMILAR CIRCLES,  EACH SPEAKING IN FAVOR  OF INDEPENDENCE  FOR SYRIA AND LEBANON.
 LIKE GIBRAN, NAJEEB DIAB  WAS PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED  BY AMERICAN IDEAS OF POLITICAL  LIBERTY AND FREE SPEECH.
THESE PEOPLE HAD COME TO AMERICA, THEY HAD TASTED THE FRUITS OF DEMOCRACY AND SECULARISM.
MOST OF THEM LIKED WHAT THEY SAW AND LIKED WHAT THEY TASTED.
THEY WANTED TO SEE IT IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.
 BUT GREG'S NOT SURE  IF GIBRAN EVER PAINTED THIS.
IT'S ALMOST TOO REALISTIC.
THERE'S NO PRE-RAPHAELITE LIGHT AND MISTINESS ABOUT IT THAT YOU SAW IN GIBRAN'S PAINTINGS.
 HE SAYS THE LARGEST  PUBLIC COLLECTION  OF GIBRAN PAINTINGS  IN THE U.S.
 IS AT THE TELFAIR MUSEUM  IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA,  SO I'M ARRANGING  TO HAVE BOB'S PORTRAIT  SHIPPED THERE  FOR COMPARISON.
 MEANWHILE, I'M GOING TO TRY  TO TRACK DOWN BOB'S COUSIN,  WHOM HE HAD SAID ONCE OWNED  ARTWORK SIGNED BY GIBRAN.
 EVENTUALLY, I LOCATE  ROBERT MADEY  ON LONG ISLAND  NEAR NEW YORK CITY.
 ROBERT IS ALSO A GRANDSON  OF THE MAN IN BOB'S PORTRAIT,  NAJEEB DIAB.
WELCOME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SKETCH THAT KHALIL GIBRAN DID AND SIGNED.
I DO, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT...
 ROBERT SHOWS ME  THE SKETCH OF HIS AUNT SELMA.
 THE WOMAN IS NAJEEB DIAB'S  DAUGHTER.
 HE SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH  THE ORIGINAL HAS BEEN SOLD,  THERE'S NO DOUBT  WHO DREW IT.
MY LOVE TO SELMA DIAB FROM GIBRAN GIBRAN.
WOW, VERY, VERY INTERESTING.
WELL, GIBRAN AND MY GRANDFATHER WERE FRIENDS.
 ROBERT EXPLAINS  THAT KHALIL GIBRAN  WAS CLOSE TO HIS  ENTIRE FAMILY,  SHARING POLITICAL  AND ARTISTIC INTERESTS.
THEY WERE FOUNDERS OF A SOCIETY CALLED AL-RABITAH, AND THAT ORGANIZATION WAS FORMED TO PROMOTE AND PERPETUATE THE ARABIC LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AND LITERATURE IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND MY FATHER, IN FACT, DELIVERED A EULOGY TO GIBRAN WHEN HE PASSED AWAY.
I'M DOING AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT IF KHALIL GIBRAN COULD HAVE ACTUALLY PAINTED THIS PORTRAIT.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS BEFORE? I HAVE.
I HAVE THE ORIGINAL PHOTO FROM WHICH THIS PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED.
THIS IS AMAZING.
THE TWIST IN THE HAIR IS AT THE EXACT SAME PLACE, THE TIE IS THE SAME, THE COAT IS THE SAME, THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS ARE THE SAME.
DO YOU KNOW WHEN THIS PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN? NO, BUT I THINK IT WAS DONE PROBABLY IN CONNECTION WITH A CONFERENCE HE ATTENDED IN PARIS IN 1913.
IT MAY HAVE BEEN DONE JUST PRIOR TO OR JUST AFTERWARDS.
 ROBERT SAYS HIS GRANDFATHER  ATTENDED  A MAJOR CONFERENCE IN PARIS  JUST BEFORE WORLD WAR I  AS THE HEAD OF  THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY.
 DELEGATES FROM ARAB NATIONS  AND OTHER IMMIGRANT GROUPS  WERE DEBATING THE BEST WAY  OF ENDING TURKISH RULE  IN SYRIA AND LEBANON.
 THE WATCH BOB SHOWED ME  WAS ALSO FROM  THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY  AND MAY WELL BE THE SAME WATCH  IN THE PORTRAIT.
 HAD GIBRAN PAINTED  THIS IMAGE OF HIS FRIEND  TO COMMEMORATE  THIS IMPORTANT MOMENT?  BOB'S SKEPTICAL THE PAINTING  WAS DONE BY GIBRAN -
 THE STYLE IS SO DIFFERENT  FROM THE IMAGE OF HIS AUNT -
 BUT HE CAN'T BE CERTAIN.
IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT HE COULD'VE DONE A COPY.
 BOB'S PAINTING HAS ARRIVED  AT THE TELFAIR MUSEUM,  WHERE I'M MEETING CURATOR  TANIA SAMMONS.
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THIS PAINTING WAS DONE BY GIBRAN.
WELL, KHALIL GIBRAN ACTUALLY WAS FIRST KNOWN FOR HIS ARTWORK.
 TANIA TELLS ME  THAT GIBRAN'S TALENT  WON THE ATTENTION  OF BOSTON'S ART COMMUNITY  WHILE HE WAS STILL  A TEEN.
 A SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS  NAMED MARY HASKELL  BECAME HIS PATRON  AND EVENTUALLY HIS LOVER.
 SHE SENT HIM TO STUDY ART  AT THE ACADEMIE JULIAN IN PARIS  AND HAD A PROFOUND INFLUENCE  ON HIS LIFE.
IN 1911, SHE HELPED HIM SET UP A STUDIO IN NEW YORK CITY.
SHE REALLY ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE OFF, BOTH IN HIS WRITING AND VISUAL CAREERS.
SO NOT ONLY DID SHE ENCOURAGE HIM TO WRITE IN ENGLISH, BUT SHE HELPED HIM LEARN THE LANGUAGE, SHE EDITED HIS WORK AS WELL.
NOW, DOES THE LACK OF A SIGNATURE TELL US ANYTHING? KHALIL GIBRAN DID SIGN HIS PIECES, BUT HE DIDN'T SIGN EVERYTHING.
HOWEVER, I WOULD SAY THE STYLE OF PAINTING IS NOT TYPICAL FOR KHALIL GIBRAN.
 TANIA SHOWS ME A SERIES  OF PAINTINGS BY GIBRAN,  AND AT FIRST GLIMPSE,  HIS WORKS DO NOT RESEMBLE  THE DIAB PORTRAIT.
YOU CAN SEE HOW HE IS NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES OF A PERSON.
IT'S VERY FLUID.
YEAH.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OIL PAINTINGS LIKE OURS WHICH ARE A PORTRAIT? I HAVE A GOOD COMPARISON.
IT'S A SELF-PORTRAIT OF KHALIL GIBRAN.
 THE STYLE OF THIS PORTRAIT  IS ALSO QUITE DIFFERENT  FROM BOB'S.
IN THIS PAINTING, GIBRAN'S BRUSH STROKES ARE VERY EVIDENT.
THEY'RE MUCH FREER.
YOU CAN SEE INDIVIDUAL COLORS IN THE PAINTING AND HIS FACE ISN'T DELINEATED LIKE THE IMAGE OF MR.
DIAB.
 I EXPLAIN THAT BOB'S PORTRAIT  MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO  WITH NAJEEB DIAB ATTENDING  A MAJOR CONFERENCE  IN PARIS IN 1913.
 TANIA SAYS THAT  DURING THAT PERIOD,  GIBRAN DID A NUMBER  OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS  OF IMPORTANT ARTISTS  AND THINKERS.
 HE CALLED IT  THE TEMPLE OF ART SERIES.
CERTAINLY MR.
DIAB WOULD HAVE FIT WITHIN THAT SERIES.
AND SO IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN UNCALLED FOR FOR DIAB TO REQUEST A PARTICULAR TYPE OF PORTRAIT FROM GIBRAN.
YEAH, CERTAINLY NOT.
IT'S TYPICAL FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMISSION PORTRAITS TO GUIDE THE ARTIST ON HOW THEY WOULD LIKE FOR THE PORTRAIT TO BE PAINTED.
 DOES BOB HAVE A PREVIOUSLY  UNKNOWN PAINTING  FROM THE  TEMPLE OF ART SERIES?  TANIA SUGGESTS THAT IF DIAB  HAD COMMISSIONED THE WORK,  GIBRAN MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT  IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE  WITH HIS LOVER,  MARY HASKELL.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING ABOUT THE TEMPLE OF ART HERE.
 THERE ARE REFERENCES  TO MANY OF THE LUMINARIES  THAT GIBRAN DREW  OR PAINTED,  INCLUDING PSYCHOTHERAPIST  CARL JUNG,  IRISH POET  WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,  AND THE LEGENDARY ACTRESS  SARAH BERNHARDT.
LISTEN TO THIS: AT LAST, THE DIVINE SARAH IS CAUGHT.
THIS IS A REFERENCE TO SARAH BERNHARDT.
BUT IF I AM TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS WITH OTHER GREAT MEN AND WOMEN, I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP ART AND BECOME A DIPLOMAT.
OKAY, HERE IS A REFERENCE TO DIAB.
 I'VE DISCOVERED  A CURIOUS NOTE  IN THE HASKELL LETTERS.
 I THINK I FINALLY HAVE  SOME ANSWERS FOR BOB.
BOB, THIS INVESTIGATION HAS ALLOWED US TO GAIN SOME INSIGHT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR GRANDFATHER AND KHALIL GIBRAN.
I SPOKE TO AN EXPERT ON HIS ARTWORK, AND SHE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THIS PAINTING IS NOT THE WORK OF KHALIL GIBRAN.
 I EXPLAIN TO BOB  THAT TO MAKE CERTAIN,  I CONSULTED THE LETTERS  AND DIARIES OF MARY HASKELL.
AND IT IS THAT SEARCH WHICH LED ME TO ONE OF MY MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES.
OKAY, HERE IS A REFERENCE TO DIAB.
IT'S QUITE POLITICAL, AND THIS IS REFERRING TO THE 1913 PARIS CONFERENCE.
DIAB AND MYSELF WERE ASKED TO GO AS REPRESENTATIVES.
THE IDEA IS FINE, BUT AFTER TALKING THINGS OVER WITH A COMMITTEE OF SYRIANS, I FOUND THAT WE DO NOT AGREE ON ANY POINT.
DIAB THINKS I AM MAD -
OTHERS THINK SO, TOO.
IT HAS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT HIM DOING A SKETCH OR A PORTRAIT OF DIAB.
 I TELL BOB THAT GIBRAN  HAD REFUSED TO ATTEND  THE 1913 PARIS CONFERENCE  BECAUSE HE HAD  FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES  WITH OTHER ATTENDEES,  INCLUDING NAJEEB DIAB.
 SO IT SEEMS UNLIKELY  THAT GIBRAN WOULD  PAINT A PORTRAIT  IN COMMEMORATION  OF THE EVENT.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR GRANDFATHER AND KHALIL GIBRAN WAS NOT ONLY OVER ISSUES OF WRITING AND ART, IT WENT TO THE HEART OF THEIR POLITICAL COMMITMENT AND WAS A REFLECTION ON THE EARLY ARAB-AMERICAN POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY.
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING.
I NEVER REALIZED THAT THEY WERE EVEN IN POLITICS, MY GRANDFATHER OR KHALIL GIBRAN.
IT'S THE ONLY PICTURE I HAVE OF MY GRANDFATHER, AND I'LL STILL KEEP IT AND CHERISH IT AT HOME.
I THANK YOU.
 IN THE 1960s,  A GENERATION HUNGRY FOR CHANGE  WAS CAPTIVATED  BY PASSAGES FROM THE PROPHET,  LIKE LOVE POSSESSES NOT  NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED;  FOR LOVE IS SUFFICIENT  UNTO LOVE.
 IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A DIFFERENT  WAY OF THINKING AND LIVING,  MANY YOUNG, DISILLUSIONED  AMERICANS  TURNED TO THE TEACHINGS  OF THE EAST.
 THE IDEAS EXPRESSED  IN THE PROPHET  MIRRORED THEIR STRUGGLE OF  THE SPIRIT AGAINST MATERIALISM.
 KHALIL GIBRAN  BECAME A VOICE  FOR THE  COUNTERCULTURE MOVEMENT.
 BUT GIBRAN  NEVER LIVED  TO SEE HIS WORDS INSPIRE  THAT GENERATION OF AMERICANS.
 HE DIED OF CIRRHOSIS  OF THE LIVER  FROM ALCOHOLISM  IN 1931.
And so, my fellow Americans...
Elyse: PRESIDENT KENNEDY IS BELIEVED TO HAVE PARAPHRASED KHALIL GIBRAN'S WRITING WHEN HE SAID: Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
[ cheering and applause ] JFK WAS ALSO FOND OF QUOTING FROM ROBERT FROST AND EVEN HAD THE POET READ AT HIS INAUGURATION.
IT'S RARE THAT POETRY AND POLITICS MIX, BUT SOMETIMES TRAGEDY BRINGS THE TWO TOGETHER.
FOLLOWING THE DISASTER THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF SEVEN ASTRONAUTS ABOARD THE SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER ON JANUARY 28, 1986, RONALD REAGAN ADDRESSED THE NATION.
We will never forget them.
WHEN HE ENDED HIS REMARKS BY SAYING THE ASTRONAUTS HAD...
Slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.
HE WAS BORROWING FROM THE FIRST AND LAST LINE OF HIGH FLIGHT.
THE POEM WAS WRITTEN IN 1941 BY A 19-YEAR-OLD PILOT OFFICER, JOHN GILLESPIE MAGEE, JR., ON THE BACK OF A LETTER TO HIS MOTHER JUST A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.
WHEN MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., WAS ASSASSINATED, BOBBY KENNEDY WENT BACK 2,500 YEARS TO THE GREEK POET AESCHYLUS TO GIVE VOICE TO HIS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.
Kennedy: Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.
