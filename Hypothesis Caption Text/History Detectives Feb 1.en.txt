HI. I'M GWEN WRIGHT, NICE TO MEET YOU. SO I HEAR YOU FOUND SOMETHING PRETTY INTERESTING AROUND HERE. YEAH, I DID. WHAT WAS IT? I FOUND A CANNON. NOW, ARE YOU SURE IT WAS A CANNON? WELL, NOT AT FIRST. ME AND MY DAD WERE WALKING ALONG THE BEACH AND THERE WAS THIS BIG BLACK ROCKY THING, SO I WENT UP A LITTLE CLOSER AND EVENTUALLY SAW RUST. I THOUGHT, ROCKS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE RUST, AND SO I CALLED MY DAD OVER. HE CAME AND CHECKED IT OUT. HE WAS LIKE, HUH, MAYBE IT'S A CANNON. HE WAS JUST JOKING, THOUGH, BUT I STILL WENT OUT THERE, AND IT WAS, SO... NOW, I'M HOPING THOSE ARE SOME PICTURES YOU TOOK. IS THAT RIGHT? YES. SO THIS IS YOU. ARE THESE YOUR SISTERS OR FRIENDS? WELL, THAT ONE'S MY SISTER AND THAT ONE'S MY FRIEND. WHAT DID YOU NOTICE, ACTUALLY, WAS IT THIS RUST HERE? YEAH, I WALKED UP CLOSER AND SAW THERE WAS RUST. AND THEN THIS FRIEND OF OURS FOUND THE SECOND ONE. <i> MIRANDA'S FRIEND MADE</i> <i> A SIMILAR FIND,</i> <i> ANOTHER BIG</i> <i> STONE-COVERED OBJECT.</i> WAS IT IN THE SAME PLACE? UM, NO, IT WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT FARTHER OUT. <i> MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY GENERATED</i> <i> A LOT OF LOCAL EXCITEMENT.</i> <i> THE MEDIA SPECULATED</i> <i> SHE'D FOUND A RELIC</i> <i> FROM THE SHIPWRECK OF AN OLD</i> <i> NAVY VESSEL CALLED THE</i> SHARK. IT WAS MADE IN 1821, AND IT CRASHED IN 1846 AROUND THIS AREA. WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT? MY DAD, HE LOOKED AT THIS BOOK, AND IT SHOWED PICTURES OF THE<i> SHARK,</i> KIND OF LOOKED AT THEM, WE WERE LIKE, OKAY, WELL, THIS HAS SOME SIMILARITIES. <i> MIRANDA'S RESEARCH</i> <i> INDICATED</i> <i> THAT THE</i> SHARK<i> SANK</i> <i> IN THE COLUMBIA RIVER</i> <i> 60 TO 75 MILES</i> <i> NORTH OF HERE</i> <i> AND THAT SOME WRECKAGE</i> <i> COULD HAVE DRIFTED SOUTH</i> <i> TO THIS BEACH.</i> CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D LIKE FOR ME TO FIND OUT? I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT IF IT REALLY IS A CANNON AND IF IT REALLY DID COME FROM THE<i> SHARK.</i> I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND FOR YOU, OKAY? OKAY. <i> WHATEVER IT IS SHE'S FOUND</i> <i> IS NOW BEING PROTECTED</i> <i> BY THE OREGON PARKS</i> <i> AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT</i> <i> AT NEHALEM BAY</i> <i> STATE PARK.</i> HI, ARE YOU CHRIS HAVEL? I AM. GWEN WRIGHT, SO NICE TO MEET YOU. <i> CHRIS HAVEL IS</i> <i> THE PROJECT COORDINATOR</i> <i> FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S</i> <i> CANNON CONSERVATION.</i> LET'S TAKE A LOOK. OH, MY. IT'S ACTUALLY BEAUTIFUL, ALL THESE COLORS. WELL, I CAN SEE THAT THIS ONE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A CANNON, ALTHOUGH THE OTHER ONE, NOT AT ALL. SO WHAT IS THIS STUFF THAT'S ALL OVER IT BEYOND THE ROCKS AND STONES I CAN SEE? WELL, THESE ARE CONCRETIONS. THIS IS A NATURAL FORM OF CONCRETE THAT FORMS AROUND ANYTHING THAT'S LEFT ON THE OCEAN SHORE IN CONTACT WITH THE SAND FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. DOES THIS KIND OF CONCRETION GIVE YOU ANY IDEA ABOUT AGE? IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL THE AGE JUST BASED ON THE CONCRETION. THE KIND OF CHEMICALS THAT ARE ON THE BEACH, THE WEATHERING, HOW MUCH WATER IS THERE, THE SALINITY, ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN AFFECT HOW QUICKLY THE CONCRETIONS BUILD UP. <i> CHRIS SAYS</i> <i> MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY</i> <i> HAS THE DEPARTMENT EXCITED</i> <i> BECAUSE 100 YEARS AGO,</i> <i> ANOTHER CANNON, ALSO PRESUMED</i> <i> TO BE FROM THE</i> USS SHARK, <i> WAS RETRIEVED FROM</i> <i> THE VERY SAME BEACH.</i> I'VE GOT A DRAWING HERE. <i> CHRIS COMPARES THE SOAKING MASS</i> <i> OF SEDIMENT AND RUST</i> <i> TO A DIAGRAM OF A </i> SHARK-ERA<i> CARRONADE,</i> <i> OR SHORT-BARRELED CANNON, THAT</i> <i> COULD BE HIDDEN BENEATH IT.</i> <i> BUT IF I'M TO DETERMINE</i> <i> WHETHER MIRANDA'S CANNON</i> <i> IS FROM THE</i> USS SHARK, <i> I'LL NEED TO LEARN</i> <i> ALL I CAN ABOUT THE SHIP,</i> <i> STARTING WITH</i> <i> ITS FINAL VOYAGE.</i> <i> I'M RETRACING</i> <i> THE</i> SHARK'S<i> ROUTE</i> <i> UP THE COLUMBIA RIVER</i> <i> TO FORT VANCOUVER,</i> <i> WHERE THE SHIP ANCHORED</i> <i> WHEN IT FIRST ARRIVED</i> <i> IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.</i> <i> THE FORT, NOW IN</i> <i> WASHINGTON STATE,</i> <i> THEN OPERATED UNDER</i> <i> AN ENGLISH CHARTER</i> <i> AND BELONGED TO</i> <i> THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY,</i> <i> THE FIRST CORPORATION</i> <i> IN NORTH AMERICA.</i> <i> GREG SHINE</i> <i> IS CHIEF RANGER.</i> WELCOME TO FORT VANCOUVER. HERE'S AN IMAGE OF THE<i> SHARK.</i> THE<i> SHARK</i> WAS A SCHOONER, AND SHE WAS LAUNCHED IN 1821. AND A FORE-AND-AFT RIGGED SCHOONER, WHICH MEANT IT HAD TWO MASTS HERE SLIGHTLY RAKED BACK. <i> THE</i> SHARK<i> WAS</i> <i> WELL-ARMED,</i> <i> HAVING POLICED</i> <i> WEST AFRICAN WATERS</i> <i> AGAINST THE SLAVE TRADE,</i> <i> SAFELY CONDUCTED FREED SLAVES</i> <i> TO NEWLY FOUNDED LIBERIA,</i> <i> AND PROTECTED</i> <i> AMERICAN MERCHANTS</i> <i> AGAINST PIRATES</i> <i> IN THE CARIBBEAN.</i> BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY CANNONS IN THIS PICTURE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SHE WAS CARRYING? YES, THE<i> SHARK</i> HAD TEN CARRONADES AND TWO LONG GUNS, AND THESE LITTLE OPEN AREAS HERE WERE CANNON PORTS. <i> THIS EXPERIENCED SHIP</i> <i> WAS CHOSEN TO SAIL</i> <i> FOR THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST</i> <i> IN 1846.</i> <i> AS THE U.S. BORDER DISPUTE</i> <i> WITH BRITAIN INTENSIFIED,</i> <i> THE</i> SHARK'S<i> COMMANDER,</i> <i> LT. NEIL HOWISON,</i> <i> WAS INSTRUCTED</i> <i> TO RALLY AMERICANS</i> <i> WITH A DISPLAY</i> <i> OF THE FLAG,</i> <i> SURVEY</i> <i> THE OREGON TERRITORY,</i> <i> AND TALK WITH BRITISH</i> <i> AND AMERICAN HOMESTEADERS</i> <i> LIVING THERE.</i> HIS ORDERS WERE VERY DIRECT: HE WAS TO COME IN TO OBTAIN THEIR DISPOSITION, WHETHER IT WAS FOR THE UNITED STATES OR FOR GREAT BRITAIN, AND ALSO TO REPORT ON THE AGRICULTURE, THE COMMERCE OF THE AREA, AND GIVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE OREGON COUNTRY. <i> HOWISON KNEW A MISSTEP</i> <i> COULD EASILY IGNITE TENSIONS</i> <i> IN THE AREA.</i> <i> PRESIDENT POLK'S</i> <i> DEMOCRATIC PARTY</i> <i> WAS PUSHING TO LEGITIMIZE</i> <i> AMERICAN SETTLEMENTS</i> <i> ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</i> <i> ONLY A YEAR EARLIER,</i> <i> IN 1845,</i> <i> THIS DRIVE WAS DUBBED</i> <i> MANIFEST DESTINY,</i> <i> IMPLYING THAT IT</i> <i> WAS GOD'S WILL</i> <i> FOR THE UNITED STATES</i> <i> TO EXPAND ACROSS THE CONTINENT</i> <i> WEST TO THE PACIFIC,</i> <i> SOUTH INTO LATIN AMERICA,</i> <i> AND NORTH INTO</i> <i> BRITISH CANADA.</i> <i> THIS BELIEF HELPED INFLAME</i> <i> THE POLITICAL RALLYING CRY</i> <i> OF 54-40 OR FIGHT,</i> <i> A CALL TO EXTEND</i> <i> AMERICA'S REACH</i> <i> THROUGH BRITISH CANADA</i> <i> ALL THE WAY</i> <i> TO LATITUDE 54 DEGREES</i> <i> AND 40 MINUTES.</i> <i> THE OREGON SETTLERS NEEDED</i> <i> LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT.</i> THERE WERE CERTAINLY SOME AMERICAN SETTLERS THAT WERE HERE THAT WERE CROSSING THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND BEGINNING TO HOMESTEAD, OR, IN THE EYES OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY, JUMPED LAND CLAIMS THAT THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY HAD ESTABLISHED. WHAT WAS THE BRITISH RESPONSE TO THE<i> SHARK</i> ARRIVING? THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY WELCOMED THE<i> SHARK</i> AND LT. HOWISON AND WELCOMED AN AMERICAN SHIP INTO THE COLUMBIA RIVER BECAUSE THEY PROVIDED SOME LAW AND ORDER, REALLY, TO AN AREA THAT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH LAW AND ORDER. <i> WITH THE LAND</i> <i> AND TEMPERAMENT SURVEYED,</i> <i> HOWISON SET SAIL</i> <i> FOR SAN FRANCISCO</i> <i> TO FILE HIS REPORT.</i> WHEN THEY LEFT FORT VANCOUVER, THEY WERE ALREADY BEHIND SCHEDULE. THE WINTER CAN BE VERY FEROCIOUS, AND ESPECIALLY AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER NEAR THE COLUMBIA RIVER BAR. <i> AS THE</i> SHARK <i> HEADED FOR OPEN SEAS,</i> <i> IT WRECKED ON</i> <i> AN UNCHARTED SANDBAR</i> <i> AT THE MOUTH</i> <i> OF THE COLUMBIA.</i> LUCKILY, ALL OF THE PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE. <i> GREG SHOWS ME HOWISON'S</i> <i> REPORT TO THE U.S. CONGRESS.</i> <i> ONE PASSAGE MAY RELATE DIRECTLY</i> <i> TO MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY.</i> <i> IT SAYS HOWISON IS EAGER</i> <i> TO RECOVER</i> <i> THE SHIP'S</i> <i> LOST WEAPONS.</i> RECEIVING INFORMATIONS THAT PART OF THE HULL WITH GUNS UPON IT HAD COME ASHORE, I SENT MIDSHIPMAN SIMES, AN ENTERPRISING YOUTH, TO VISIT THE SPOT. <i> IN THE WATER</i> <i> JUST OFF THE BEACH,</i> <i> SIMES FOUND</i> <i> A BROKEN SECTION OF DECK</i> <i> WITH THREE OF THE</i> SHARK'S <i> ONE-TON CARRONADES.</i> HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE ABOVE THE HIGH-WATER MARK, BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE INACCESSIBLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SURF. <i> GREG SAYS</i> <i> THE RESCUED CARRONADE</i> <i> WAS DRAGGED</i> <i> TOWARD THE SHORE</i> <i> BUT HAD TO BE ABANDONED.</i> <i> IN 1898, IT WAS REDISCOVERED</i> <i> AFTER A STORM</i> <i> AND IS NOW ON EXHIBIT</i> <i> AT THE CANNON BEACH</i> <i> HISTORICAL SOCIETY MUSEUM.</i> <i> DID MIRANDA DISCOVER</i> <i> ONE OF THE TWO</i> <i> LEFT IN THE SURF?</i> EOLOGIST <i> DENNIS GRIFFIN</i> <i> SAYS THE COLUMBIA RIVER</i> <i> WAS A NOTORIOUS GRAVEYARD</i> <i> FOR HUNDREDS OF SHIPS,</i> <i> NOT JUST THE</i> SHARK. WHAT WE SEE TODAY IS A SMALL GLIMPSE OF WHAT IT ONCE WAS. IT WAS THE MIGHTY COLUMBIA BEFORE ALL THE DAMS. BUT THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA WAS A VERY WICKED PLACE. YOU HAD TIDES COMING UP THERE OR STORMS COMING UP THERE FROM 35 TO 50 FEET WAVES TO CRASH. FIFTY FEET WAVES! HUGE WAVES. THEY CALL THIS THE GRAVEYARD OF THE PACIFIC. <i> THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER</i> <i> WAS KNOWN TO BE DANGEROUS,</i> <i> BUT DENNIS SAYS IF YOU WANTED</i> <i> A PIECE OF THE REGION'S WEALTH,</i> <i> YOU HAD TO RUN</i> <i> THE COLUMBIA'S GAUNTLET.</i> YOU HAD THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY IN CANADA COMING ACROSS FOR FURS. LOTS AND LOTS OF SALMON. SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BIG CITIES, THEY NEEDED WOOD. PEOPLE CAME UP THE COAST, FOUND LOTS OF TREES. <i> ALL THAT SHIP TRAFFIC MEANT</i> <i> A LOT OF WRECKS OVER THE YEARS.</i> OF THE 308 I KNOW, I HAVE 104 THAT I THINK WERE WRECKED EITHER AT THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA AND DOWN TO ARCH CAPE, IN THAT AREA. NOW, OF THOSE 104, WE HAVE TO NARROW IT DOWN, WHICH ONES CARRIED CANNON, AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT, AND THAT'S A BIG IMPORTANT PART. WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE ODDS THAT THE CANNONS WE HAVE ARE FROM THE<i> SHARK?</i> EVERYONE WANTS TO SAY IT'S THE<i> SHARK.</i> I KNOW. AND I'D LIKE TO THINK OF IT BEING THE<i> SHARK,</i> BUT YOU DON'T KNOW. <i> DENNIS SUGGESTS THE RECOVERED</i> SHARK<i> CARRONADE</i> <i> COULD HELP RESOLVE</i> <i> OUR MYSTERY.</i> <i> I'M MEETING COLUMBIA RIVER</i> <i> MARITIME MUSEUM CURATOR</i> <i> DAVID PEARSON</i> <i> FOR A CLOSER LOOK.</i> SO THIS IS IT, THE CANNON THAT WAS FOUND IN 1898? THIS IS IT, RIGHT, JANUARY OF 1898. <i> DAVE SAYS THIS CANNON WAS</i> <i> RECOVERED ON THE SAME BEACH,</i> <i> ABOUT 200 FEET FROM WHERE</i> <i> MIRANDA MADE HER DISCOVERY.</i> WAS THIS THE ORIGINAL BASE, BY THE WAY? THIS ONE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS ACTUALLY A REPRODUCTION FROM NAVAL DRAWINGS THAT ARE WELL KNOWN. <i> IF MIRANDA'S DISCOVERY</i> <i> HAS A SIMILAR BASE,</i> <i> THAT WOULD CONFIRM</i> <i> IT'S A CARRONADE</i> <i> FROM THE RIGHT ERA,</i> <i> BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE</i> SHARK <i> OR EVEN AN AMERICAN SHIP.</i> <i> THE CARRONADE WAS INVENTED</i> <i> BY THE BRITISH FOR THEIR NAVY.</i> THEIR CARRONADE WAS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE DECK OF THE SHIP. AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE PINNED AT THE FRONT OF IT AND THEN SWIVEL ON THAT PIN TO PREVENT IT FROM MOVING AROUND ON THE SHIP. IT WAS THE OLD EXPRESSION, LOOSE CANNONS, AND THAT WAS EXACTLY IT, THAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU WANTED ON A SHIP HEAVING IN THE WAVES WAS A CANNON BOUNCING AROUND. SO THE NAVY TOOK THE ADDITIONAL STEP AND WOULD ACTUALLY PIN THEM TO THE DECK. <i> DAVE EXPLAINS</i> <i> HOW THIS WORKED.</i> <i> A THREADED PIN AT THE BACK</i> <i> OF THE BARREL</i> <i> ADJUSTED THE TILT.</i> <i> THE BARREL WAS MOUNTED ON</i> <i> A SMALL BASE, OR SLIDER,</i> <i> WHICH FIT ONTO A LONGER</i> <i> SLOTTED BOARD.</i> <i> THIS BOARD SAT ON ROLLERS</i> <i> AT THE BACK</i> <i> AND PIVOTED</i> <i> AT THE FRONT.</i> <i> ANOTHER PIN BENEATH</i> <i> THE CARRONADE</i> <i> WENT FROM THE SLIDER</i> <i> INTO THE SLOT.</i> <i> WHEN THE CARRONADE FIRED,</i> <i> THIS CONTROLLED THE RECOIL.</i> <i> DAVE SAYS THE RECENT FINDS SHOW</i> <i> SIMILARITIES TO THIS DESIGN.</i> THEY STILL HAVE THAT SLIDER ATTACHED TO IT, OR AT LEAST EVIDENCE OF THAT. THAT BRINGS THE PROBABILITY OF THIS BEING A U.S. NAVY SHIP MUCH, MUCH HIGHER IN OUR EYES. <i> BUT WITH ALL THE CONCRETION</i> <i> SURROUNDING MIRANDA'S OBJECT,</i> <i> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE</i> <i> A DEFINITIVE CONNECTION.</i> <i> MY INVESTIGATION</i> <i> MIGHT BE AT AN END.</i> <i> BUT BECAUSE INTEREST</i> <i> IN MIRANDA'S FIND IS HIGH,</i> <i> I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SCHEDULE AN</i> <i> X-RAY SESSION FOR THE CANNONS.</i> <i> I'M RETURNING TO NEHALEM BAY</i> <i> TO MEET ROBERT NEYLAND,</i> <i> HEAD OF THE UNDERWATER</i> <i> ARCHEOLOGY BRANCH</i> <i> OF THE NAVAL</i> <i> HISTORICAL CENTER,</i> <i> WHO WILL EXAMINE</i> <i> THE X-RAYS.</i> THIS IS JUST A GENERIC CARRONADE. <i> BOB TELLS ME</i> <i> THESE WERE COMMON</i> <i> ON MANY NAVY SHIPS</i> <i> LIKE THE</i> SHARK <i> IN THE FIRST HALF</i> <i> OF THE 19th CENTURY.</i> IN A CLOSE-IN FIGHT, THEY WOULD DO MORE DAMAGE TO THE OPPOSING OR THE ENEMY SHIP AND DO MORE DAMAGE TO THE CREWS, TOO. IT WOULD SMASH UP THE WOOD OR THE SHIP A LOT MORE. <i> BECAUSE THIS SMALL CANNON</i> <i> WAS A POPULAR WEAPON,</i> <i> BOB SAYS MATCHING IT</i> <i> TO THE</i> SHARK<i> WILL BE TOUGH.</i> <i> BUT ONCE THE X-RAYS</i> <i> HAVE PENETRATED</i> <i> MORE THAN 150 YEARS</i> <i> OF DEPOSITS,</i> <i> THEY MAY REVEAL</i> <i> SOMETHING TELLING.</i> YOU COULD GET LUCKY AND ACTUALLY SEE A DATE MARKED ON THE GUNS AS WELL AS FOUNDRY MARKS. YOU COULD GET LUCKY AND SEE THAT. THAT'D BE VERY LUCKY. YEAH, IT WOULD BE. YOU KNOW, OR SAY U.S. NAVY AS WELL, TOO. <i> TO CAPTURE A GLIMPSE OF THE</i> <i> OBJECT BENEATH THIS THICK MASS</i> <i> REQUIRES AN EXTREMELY</i> <i> HIGH-POWERED SYSTEM.</i> <i> A TEAM OF SPECIALISTS</i> <i> IN NUCLEAR IMAGING</i> <i> FROM FUJIFILM NDT</i> <i> AND PSI INCORPORATED</i> <i> ARE VOLUNTEERING</i> <i> THEIR EXPERTISE TO HELP.</i> <i> BOB EXAMINES MIRANDA'S CANNON</i> <i> TO PLAN THE X-RAYS.</i> HERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR PIN FOR THE CARRIAGE. THIS APPEARS TO BE WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR BREACH RING, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF IT'S BROKEN OFF IF I'M CORRECT IN THAT. THE SCREW, THE ELEVATING SCREW, SHOULD BE RIGHT IN HERE SOMEWHERE AS WELL, TOO. YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BACK OFF. IT'S GOING TO GET REAL HOT RIGHT HERE. <i> THE FILM NEEDS TO BE EXPOSED</i> <i> FOR NEARLY 90 MINUTES</i> <i> TO CAPTURE ENOUGH DETAIL.</i> <i> WHEN ALL OF THE EXPOSURES</i> <i> ARE FINALLY COMPLETE,</i> <i> WE TAKE THE X-RAY PLATES</i> <i> INSIDE TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE.</i> STILL NOT GETTING ANYTHING, HUH? I CAN SEE A LITTLE MORE. <i> THE FIRST IMAGE</i> <i> REVEALS LITTLE.</i> <i> THE SECOND PLATE IS</i> <i> ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER,</i> <i> BUT IT DOES OUTLINE</i> <i> THE SHAPE OF A CANNON BARREL.</i> IN THIS SHOT, WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE BORE, WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THE BANDING AROUND THE GUN... <i> THE BANDING KEPT THE BARREL</i> <i> FROM RUPTURING WHEN FIRED.</i> <i> WE'RE DOWN</i> <i> TO THE LAST PLATE.</i> THAT IS A GREAT SHOT. NOW WE'RE TALKING. <i> IT'S TIME TO GIVE</i> <i> MIRANDA HER ANSWER.</i> I HAVE DONE ALL THE RESEARCH THAT WAS POSSIBLE ON THE CANNON THAT YOU FOUND. BUT THIS IS NOT JUST A CANNON, IT'S A CERTAIN KIND OF CANNON CALLED A CARRONADE THAT WAS ON U.S. NAVY SHIPS IN THE EARLY HALF OF THE 19th CENTURY. <i> I TELL MIRANDA ABOUT</i> <i> THE</i> USS SHARK'S<i> ROLE</i> <i> IN THE SHAPING</i> <i> OF AMERICA'S BORDERS</i> <i> AND ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS.</i> <i> ONLY VERY POWERFUL X-RAYS</i> <i> COULD PEER DEEP</i> <i> INTO THE MASS OF SEDIMENT</i> <i> AND RUSTED METAL</i> <i> TO REVEAL WHAT LIES</i> <i> UNDERNEATH.</i> SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE? THERE'S YOUR SCREW. EXCELLENT. I GUESS THIS IS THE THREADING ON IT, RIGHT? YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE YOU'VE STILL GOT THE THREADS VERY VISIBLE IN HERE. OH, THAT'S WHERE YOU'D CRANK IT, OKAY. THE LOOP HERE FOR THE BREACH ROPE, A LONG GUN WOULDN'T HAVE THAT. THE ELEVATING SCREW, A LONG GUN WOULD NOT HAVE AN ELEVATING SCREW. IT'S DEFINITELY A CARRONADE. BUT IT ALSO COMPARES VERY FAVORABLY TO THE CANNON THAT WAS RECOVERED IN THE 1890s AND IS NOW AN EXHIBIT, SO SUGGESTING IT IS THE SAME TIME OF CANNON, PERHAPS FROM THE SAME SHIP. I DON'T SEE ANYWHERE WHERE IT SAYS<i> USS SHARK</i> OR U.S. NAVY, BUT THIS IS ALL CONSISTENT WITH THE CARRONADE. SO FAR, CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, IT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'D EXPECT TO SEE FOR A CARRONADE FROM THE<i> SHARK.</i> AND HERE IS AN X-RAY OF THE PART OF THE CANNON THAT WOULD GO INTO THE DECK THERE. YOU WOULD SCREW IT TO LIFT IT UP. THAT'S AWESOME. THANK YOU. ALL THE PEOPLE AGREE THAT WHILE WE'LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE, YOU PROBABLY FOUND THE CANNON THAT WAS ON THE<i> USS SHARK.</i> NICE, THAT'S PRETTY COOL. DON'T YOU FEEL PROUD ABOUT THAT? YEAH, THAT'S COOL. YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T JUST GIVE US A CRITICAL PART OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF OREGON BUT TELLS US ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY. WOW, ONE CANNON. YEAH. <i> THE GREAT IRONY</i> <i> OF THE</i> SHARK'S<i> STORY</i> <i> WAS THAT A TREATY</i> <i> ENDING THE DISPUTE</i> <i> OVER THE CANADIAN BORDER</i> <i> WAS SIGNED IN JUNE OF 1846,</i> <i> ONE MONTH BEFORE THE</i> SHARK <i> ARRIVED AT THE COLUMBIA RIVER.</i> <i> NEWS DIDN'T REACH</i> <i> LIEUTENANT HOWISON</i> <i> UNTIL A MONTH</i> <i> AFTER THE</i> SHARK<i> SANK.</i> <i> THE OREGON TREATY SET</i> <i> THE U.S./CANADIAN BORDER</i> <i> AT THE 49th PARALLEL,</i> <i> WHERE IT REMAINS TODAY.</i> SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST FASCINATING HISTORICAL OBJECTS HAVE EMERGED FROM THE DEEP. OCEANS, RIVERS, AND LAKES ARE TOMBS FOR AN INCALCULABLE WEALTH OF OBJECTS. ALTHOUGH UNDERWATER RECOVERY IS NOT ALWAYS EASY, ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE MADE MARITIME ARCHEOLOGY AN EXCITING NEW FRONTIER FOR HISTORIANS. IN 1943, JACQUES COUSTEAU AND EMILE GAGNON REVOLUTIONIZED UNDERWATER EXPLORATION WITH THEIR AQUA-LUNG, A SELF-CONTAINED UNDERWATER BREATHING APPARATUS. THIS SCUBA DEVICE ALLOWED HUMANS TO FREELY DIVE TO DEPTHS OF 180 FEET. THE NEXT GREAT ADVANCE WAS TITANIUM-REINFORCED SUBMERSIBLES, WHICH COULD PROBE TWO AND A HALF MILES BELOW SEA LEVEL. IN 1985, AN UNMANNED SUBMERSIBLE FINALLY MADE CONTACT WITH THE<i> TITANIC.</i> THE NOTION THAT A GREAT GASH HAD RIPPED THE SHIP IN TWO WAS NOW DEBUNKED. IN 2002, ONE OF HISTORY'S MOST SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERIES WAS MADE BY SHEER ACCIDENT. OFF INDIA'S COAST, OCEANOGRAPHERS UNEARTHED WHAT COULD BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST CIVILIZATIONS. SCIENTISTS USED SONAR TO IDENTIFY HUGE GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES DATING BACK 10,000 YEARS. Elyse: <i> OUR NEXT STORY</i> <i> INVESTIGATES</i> <i> A CONNECTICUT FARMHOUSE</i> <i> WITH AN UNSETTLED PAST.</i> <i> AS THE 20th CENTURY DAWNS,</i> <i> AMERICA'S CITIES</i> <i> ARE INDUSTRIALIZING</i> <i> AND GROWING AT</i> <i> AN EXPLOSIVE RATE.</i> <i> THEY'RE BEING FILLED</i> <i> BY A TIDAL WAVE</i> <i> OF IMMIGRANTS FROM EUROPE</i> <i> AND NATIVE-BORN AMERICANS</i> <i> WHO ARE ABANDONING</i> <i> THEIR FAMILY FARMS</i> <i> FOR THE OPPORTUNITY</i> <i> AND BETTER WAGES</i> <i> OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.</i> <i> MORE THAN 100 YEARS LATER,</i> <i> CHRIS REMY OF EAST HADDAM,</i> <i> CONNECTICUT,</i> <i> BELIEVES HIS HOME</i> <i> MAY SOMEHOW BE CONNECTED</i> <i> TO THIS DRAMATIC PERIOD</i> <i> IN AMERICA'S PAST.</i> I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF MY HOUSE, WHO WERE THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED HERE. HI. I'M ELYSE. CHRIS, COME ON IN. WHAT A GREAT HOUSE. THANK YOU. SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU OWNED IT? WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE SIX YEARS AGO. IT'S FIVE ACRES, PART OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY A 60-ACRE FARM. THIS IS THE MAP FROM WHEN THEY SUBDIVIDED IT BACK IN THE '70s, AND HERE'S OUR FIVE-ACRE PLOT RIGHT HERE. WHAT SPARKED YOUR INTEREST IN DOING RESEARCH? WELL, I KNEW THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN 1804, OBVIOUSLY, WHEN I BOUGHT IT, SO I WANTED TO RESEARCH WHAT I COULD FIND OUT, WHO BUILT IT AND WHEN, AND WHO'S LIVED HERE. WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT? WELL, I FOUND OUT THAT AROUND THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY, THE PROPERTY SEEMED TO CHANGE HANDS A LOT OF TIMES -
- EVERY YEAR, EVERY TWO YEARS -
- FOR A GOOD 15, 20 YEARS, AND THEY SEEMED TO HAVE RUSSIAN AND EASTERN-EUROPEAN NAMES. WHAT SPECIFICALLY DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT? I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE, WHAT WERE THEY DOING HERE... MM-HMM. AND WHY DID THE PROPERTY CHANGE HANDS SO MANY TIMES IN SUCH A SHORT TIME FRAME? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME TO GO ON? WELL, WHEN I WAS DOING SOME REMODELING ON THE HOUSE, INSIDE THE WALLS, I FOUND THIS OLD WALLPAPER. ON THE OTHER SIDE IS NEWSPAPER WITH HEBREW CHARACTERS. AND AT THE TOP OF THIS PAGE YOU CAN SEE IT'S<i> THE JEWISH</i> <i> MORNING JOURNAL.</i> WELL, I'M GOING TO GO WALK OUTSIDE AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND, AND THEN I GUESS I'M OFF TO THE TOWN HALL. OKAY. <i> I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED</i> <i> IN THIS STORY.</i> <i> MY OWN FAMILY ARRIVED</i> <i> FROM EASTERN EUROPE</i> <i> AND SETTLED IN NEW YORK CITY</i> <i> AND BALTIMORE, MARYLAND,</i> <i> THREE GENERATIONS AGO.</i> <i> BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY SO MANY</i> <i> EASTERN-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS --</i> <i> IF THAT'S WHAT</i> <i> THEY WERE --</i> <i> ROTATED THROUGH THIS FARMHOUSE</i> <i> AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.</i> <i> MY FIRST STOP</i> <i> IS TOWN HALL.</i> <i> THERE ARE LAND DEEDS HERE</i> <i> GOING BACK TWO CENTURIES.</i> <i> BEFORE I SCOUR</i> <i> THESE BOUND RECORDS,</i> <i> I WANT TO LEARN MORE</i> <i> ABOUT THE OLD NEWSPAPERS</i> <i> FROM INSIDE THE WALLS</i> <i> OF THE HOUSE.</i> <i> THE JEWISH MORNING JOURNAL</i> WAS APPARENTLY AN ULTRA-ORTHODOX NEWSPAPER THAT STARTED PRINTING IN THE UNITED STATES IN NEW YORK CITY IN 1902. LISTEN TO THIS: THE PAPER WASN'T WRITTEN IN HEBREW, IT WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN YIDDISH. YIDDISH IS WRITTEN WITH HEBREW CHARACTERS, BUT IT IS DIFFERENT. IT'S DERIVED FROM THE GERMAN LANGUAGE. THERE'S PROBABLY ONLY A QUARTER-MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY THAT SPEAK YIDDISH, INCLUDING MY GRANDMOTHER. <i> I KNOW FROM HER</i> <i> THAT BACK THEN,</i> <i> THE LANGUAGE</i> <i> WAS SPOKEN WIDELY</i> <i> AMONG JEWISH IMMIGRANTS</i> <i> FROM EASTERN EUROPE.</i> ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT THE LAND DEEDS CAN TELL US. <i> HERE'S THE FIRST RECORD</i> <i> OF THE SALE OF THE LAND.</i> ON JULY 17, 1798, JUSTIN WORTHINGTON SOLD THE LAND TO CIRUS WILLEY. <i> THE FARM STAYED IN</i> <i> THE SAME HANDS</i> <i> FOR MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS</i> <i> OF A CENTURY.</i> <i> THE WILLEY FAMILY</i> <i> SOLD THE FARM IN 1878,</i> <i> AND THE REAL ESTATE</i> <i> TRANSACTIONS LOOK PRETTY NORMAL</i> <i> UNTIL 1891.</i> ON JUNE 15, 1891, IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAND WAS SOLD TO DAVID DINSON. <i> ONLY FOUR MONTHS LATER,</i> <i> DINSON SELLS THE FARM</i> <i> TO LEWIS NAMEROV</i> <i> AND LOUIS NATESZON</i> <i> OF NEW YORK CITY.</i> <i> JUST NINE MONTHS AFTER THAT,</i> <i> IT'S SOLD AGAIN.</i> <i> BETWEEN 1891 AND 1906, THE</i> <i> FARM CHANGES HANDS SIX TIMES:</i> <i> DINSON,</i> <i> NAMEROV AND NATESZON,</i> <i> MALLER, BOOX,</i> <i> KATZ AND KURRIER,</i> <i> RITTER AND AZWOLENSKY.</i> <i> AND THE SALE PRICE</i> <i> OFTEN INCLUDED LIVESTOCK</i> <i> AND VARIOUS</i> <i> FARM EQUIPMENT.</i> <i> SOMETHING ELSE APPEARS</i> <i> TO LINK THE FAMILIES</i> <i> WHO PASSED THROUGH</i> <i> CHRIS'S HOME.</i> A FEW OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE MORTGAGES FROM THE SAME LENDERS, THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND AND THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY, BOTH NEW YORK CORPORATIONS. <i> CENSUS RECORDS CONFIRM SEVERAL</i> <i> OF THE FARM'S EARLY OWNERS</i> <i> WERE FROM RUSSIA.</i> MAX AND GUSSIE MALLER, OR MULLER AS IT'S WRITTEN IN THE CENSUS, CAME TO AMERICA FROM RUSSIA IN 1886. AND THE ENTIRE RITTER FAMILY WAS BORN IN RUSSIA, ALSO. SO FAR, I HAVE RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS MOVING FROM NEW YORK CITY, I HAVE A YIDDISH PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NEW YORK CITY, AND I HAVE LOANS GIVEN BY TWO CORPORATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. EVERYTHING IS POINTING TO MANHATTAN. <i> I'M MEETING IMMIGRATION</i> <i> HISTORIAN DANIEL SAWYER</i> <i> AT NEW YORK'S LOWER EAST SIDE</i> <i> TENEMENT MUSEUM.</i> DANIEL, I'M INVESTIGATING THIS FARMHOUSE THAT'S IN CONNECTICUT, AND IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY, THERE WAS A LOT OF TURNOVER. THE PEOPLE WERE GENERALLY COMING FROM NEW YORK CITY, AND THERE WERE TWO NAMES ON THE MORTGAGE THAT I KEPT SEEING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THERE WAS THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND AND THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY. WELL, THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND WAS SET UP IN 1891 BY BARON MAURICE de HIRSCH, WHO WAS A EUROPEAN JEWISH PHILANTHROPIST, IN ORDER TO HELP THE EASTERN-EUROPEAN JEWISH IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES TO GET ESTABLISHED IN THEIR NEW HOME. <i> DANIEL EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> IN MARCH 1881,</i> <i> THE ASSASSINATION OF THE</i> <i> RUSSIAN CZAR ALEXANDER II</i> <i> TRIGGERED A MASSIVE JEWISH</i> <i> MIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES.</i> THERE WAS A POPULAR FEELING THAT THE JEWS HAD BEEN BEHIND THIS, AND SO THERE WAS A WAVE OF POGROMS, WHICH WERE ANTI-JEWISH RIOTS, IN WHICH MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MUCH PROPERTY WAS DESTROYED. <i> OVER THE NEXT DECADE,</i> <i> MORE THAN 200,000</i> <i> EASTERN-EUROPEAN JEWS</i> <i> FLOODED INTO THE MAIN</i> <i> EAST COAST PORTS,</i> <i> PARTICULARLY NEW YORK.</i> <i> BY THE TURN</i> <i> OF THE CENTURY,</i> <i> MORE THAN HALF A MILLION</i> <i> HAD ARRIVED.</i> SO THEY CAME HERE SEEKING A BETTER LIFE. ABSOLUTELY. CAME HERE SEEKING JOBS AND A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING. <i> MANY OF THESE JEWISH</i> <i> REFUGEES SETTLED</i> <i> IN NEW YORK CITY'S</i> <i> LOWER EAST SIDE,</i> <i> SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE</i> <i> WHO SHARED</i> <i> A COMMON BACKGROUND,</i> <i> FAITH, AND LANGUAGE.</i> <i> BUT DANIEL EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> PACKED INTO THE SLUMS OF ONE</i> <i> OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED</i> <i> NEIGHBORHOODS ON EARTH,</i> <i> THE NEW ARRIVALS ALSO</i> <i> FOUND THEMSELVES AT ODDS</i> <i> WITH THE ESTABLISHED</i> <i> AMERICANIZED JEWISH COMMUNITY.</i> THEY HAD A VERY AMBIVALENT FEELING TOWARDS THESE NEWCOMERS. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY FELT A KINSHIP WITH THESE PEOPLE AND WANTED TO HELP. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY WERE FOREIGN, THEY SPOKE YIDDISH, THEY WERE POOR, AND THE ESTABLISHED JEWISH COMMUNITY WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD REFLECT BADLY ON THEM, AND SO THEY FELT AN ADDED IMPETUS TO HELP PEOPLE ESTABLISH THEMSELVES, AMERICANIZE, AND GET ESTABLISHED ECONOMICALLY AS WELL. HOW DOES THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND AND THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY FIT INTO ALL OF THIS? THE JEWISH AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL AID SOCIETY WAS A SPIN-OFF OF THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND, WHICH PROVIDED PEOPLE WITH MORTGAGES WHEN THEY WANTED TO GET SET UP AS FARMERS ON THE LAND AND WITH HOUSES. <i> HE SAYS OUR DEED HOLDERS</i> <i> WERE PART OF A PLAN</i> <i> TO EASE OVERCROWDING</i> <i> BY RELOCATING JEWS</i> <i> OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY,</i> <i> WHERE THEY COULD EARN</i> <i> A LIVING OFF THE LAND.</i> <i> BUT HE CAN'T</i> <i> SHED ANY LIGHT</i> <i> ON WHO OUR RUSSIAN</i> <i> IMMIGRANTS WERE</i> <i> OR WHY SO MANY SEEMED</i> <i> TO HAVE STAYED</i> <i> FOR SUCH A BRIEF PERIOD</i> <i> AT CHRIS'S FARMHOUSE.</i> <i> THE CENTER</i> <i> FOR JEWISH HISTORY</i> <i> HOUSES THE PAPERS</i> <i> OF THE BARON'S FUND</i> <i> AND THE JEWISH</i> <i> AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.</i> <i> IN A VOLUME ABOUT</i> <i> THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS</i> <i> FACING RUSSIAN JEWS AT</i> <i> THE TURN OF THE 19th CENTURY,</i> <i> I DISCOVER THE JEWISH</i> <i> AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY,</i> <i> OR J.A.S., SET FAMILIES</i> <i> UP ON FARMLAND</i> <i> ALL ACROSS NEW ENGLAND.</i> INDIVIDUAL JEWISH FARMERS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE NEW ENGLAND STATES AND OWN FARMS IN RHODE ISLAND, MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT, MAINE, VERMONT, AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. BY FAR THE GREATEST NUMBER ARE LOCATED IN CONNECTICUT, AND THEY HAVE FORMED THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION OF THE JEWISH FARMING COMMUNITY IN NEW ENGLAND. THIS IS A LEDGER BOOK THAT LISTS LOANS FROM THE BARON de HIRSCH FUND. LET'S SEE... AH, CONNECTICUT. <i> ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO INFORMATION</i> <i> ON OUR FAMILIES,</i> <i> THE ORIGINAL</i> <i> LOAN APPLICATIONS</i> <i> DESCRIBE HOW THE</i> <i> LENDING PROCESS WORKED.</i> <i> SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS</i> <i> WERE RUSSIAN JEWS</i> <i> WHO WERE HEALTHY ENOUGH</i> <i> TO HANDLE FARM WORK</i> <i> AND WHO ALSO HAD A LITTLE BIT</i> <i> OF MONEY TO GET STARTED.</i> <i> FOR THOSE</i> <i> WHO DIDN'T QUALIFY,</i> <i> THE FUND PROVIDED</i> <i> TRADE SCHOOLS, ENGLISH CLASSES,</i> <i> AND SCHOLARSHIPS</i> <i> FOR STUDENTS IN THE CITY.</i> BUT I'M NOT FINDING ANY INFORMATION ON OUR FARMERS. HI. HI, ELYSE. <i> I'M MEETING CONNECTICUT</i> <i> HISTORIAN BRIANN GREENFIELD</i> <i> AT THE STATE ARCHIVES.</i> <i> SHE EXPLAINS WHY CONNECTICUT</i> <i> WAS SUCH A POPULAR CHOICE</i> <i> FOR THE IMMIGRANT FARMERS.</i> WELL, THE SHORT ANSWER IS AVAILABLE LAND. A LOT OF OLD YANKEE FARMERS WERE MOVING AWAY FROM THE FARMS. THEY WERE BEING PULLED OUT WEST, WHERE AGRICULTURE WAS MORE PRODUCTIVE, OR THEY WERE COMING TO THE FACTORY JOBS THAT WERE AVAILABLE IN THE CITY. <i> BRIANN TELLS ME THAT</i> <i> THE STATE WORRIED</i> <i> ABOUT THE ABANDONED FARM</i> <i> PROBLEM</i> <i> AND THE DECLINE</i> <i> OF RURAL COMMUNITIES.</i> <i> IN 1892, THEY BEGAN TO PUBLISH</i> <i> LISTS OF FARMS FOR SALE.</i> THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF FARMS FOR SALE IN CONNECTICUT THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1899. SO IT'S A REAL ESTATE LISTING? THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THEY HAVE MAPS, AND THERE ARE SOME PICTURES IN HERE AS WELL. THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE KINDS OF FARMS THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT. THERE'S EVEN SOME IN EAST HADDAM. <i> BRIANN EXPLAINS</i> <i> THE RUSSIAN JEWS</i> <i> WEREN'T THE ONLY NEWCOMERS</i> <i> SETTLING THE OLD YANKEE FARMS.</i> IT WAS ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT GROUPS, AND THIS WAS A PERIOD OF HEAVY IMMIGRATION. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ARTICLE. ALIEN INVASION OF CONNECTICUT FARMS. EVERY THIRD FARM IN CONNECTICUT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF A MAN OF FOREIGN BIRTH. THERE IS NO CORNER OF THE STATE INTO WHICH THE IMMIGRANT FOREIGNER HAS NOT PENETRATED AND THAT HE COMES FROM LANDS THE POLES APART IN CUSTOMS, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, AND MORALITY. THAT SEEMS PRETTY NEGATIVE TO ME. WELL, TO BE VERY HONEST, I THINK THEY SAW IT AS BOTH A BLESSING AND AS A THREAT. A BLESSING BECAUSE THEY NEEDED AGRICULTURAL LABOR, BUT ALSO A THREAT BECAUSE PEOPLE FEARED THE LOSS OF YANKEE CULTURE. <i> THE FAMILIES WHO LIVED</i> <i> IN CHRIS'S HOME</i> <i> SWAPPED THE OVERCROWDING</i> <i> AND CLASS TENSION</i> <i> OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY</i> <i> IN NEW YORK</i> <i> FOR THE XENOPHOBIA</i> <i> OF THE YANKEES IN CONNECTICUT.</i> <i> DOES THAT EXPLAIN</i> <i> WHY THE ARRIVALS</i> <i> ONLY STAYED FOR</i> <i> SUCH A SHORT TIME?</i> <i> MARY DONOHUE IS</i> <i> AN ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIAN</i> <i> WITH THE CONNECTICUT COMMISSION</i> <i> ON CULTURE AND TOURISM.</i> HI, MARY, ELYSE. HI. LET'S HEAD IN HERE. MARY, I'M INVESTIGATING A FARMHOUSE IN CONNECTICUT THAT DURING THE EARLY 20th CENTURY HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TURNOVER WITH RUSSIAN JEWS, AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY. WELL, THEY SETTLED ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN IN A VERY JEWISH AREA, BUT THEN TO MOVE TO THE COUNTRY WAS A VERY HARD MOVE. SUDDENLY, THEY'RE IN THE CONNECTICUT COUNTRYSIDE, WHERE THERE'S NOT A READY-MADE JEWISH COMMUNITY, THEY DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH -
- THAT MADE IT HARDER. <i> BUT MARY DOUBTS</i> <i> RESENTMENT OF THE NEWCOMERS</i> <i> WAS THE REASON</i> <i> FOR THE HIGH TURNOVER.</i> I THINK IF THE JEWISH FARMERS WORKED HARD AND BECAME SUCCESSFUL, THEY REALLY HAD THE YANKEE FARMERS' RESPECT. <i> BUT IF IT WASN'T</i> <i> XENOPHOBIA,</i> <i> WHY WEREN'T THE FAMILIES</i> <i> WHO LIVED IN CHRIS'S FARMHOUSE</i> <i> ABLE TO MAKE A GO</i> <i> OF IT?</i> THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH CAME THROUGH IN 1908. <i> WHAT MARY TELLS ME NEXT</i> <i> PUTS ALL THE PIECES</i> <i> OF THE PUZZLE IN PLACE.</i> <i> IT'S TIME TO HEAD BACK</i> <i> TO CHRIS.</i> CHRIS, I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND OUT A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED HERE, BUT YOU WERE RIGHT, THEY WERE RUSSIAN JEWS. THAT'S GREAT. PRETTY COOL, RIGHT? PRETTY COOL. <i> I TELL CHRIS HOW,</i> <i> WITH THE HELP OF ORGANIZATIONS</i> <i> LIKE THE JEWISH</i> <i> AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY,</i> <i> IMMIGRANTS ESCAPED FROM</i> <i> THE SLUMS OF NEW YORK CITY</i> <i> TO FARMS SUCH AS HIS.</i> BUT WHEN THEY GOT HERE, IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY. THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TRAINING AS FARMERS, AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE REFUGEES. THEY WERE IN THE TRADES, THEY WERE PROFESSIONALS, THEY WERE ALMOST ANYTHING BUT A FARMER. YOU WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO OWN LAND IN RUSSIA IF YOU WERE JEWISH. IT WAS ALSO VERY MARGINAL LAND. CONNECTICUT POTATOES ARE REALLY ROCKS. THIS IS FARMLAND THAT'S BEEN USED HARD FOR OVER 200 YEARS. <i> MANY SIMPLY</i> <i> COULDN'T MAKE IT,</i> <i> AND THE OLD YANKEE FARMS</i> <i> KEPT CHANGING HANDS.</i> WOW, THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED. WELL, I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH TURNOVER. THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND DECIDED TO GIVE UP. <i> BUT THE STORY</i> <i> DOESN'T END THERE.</i> <i> MARY EXPLAINED THAT</i> <i> THE ORGANIZATIONS</i> <i> THAT HELPED</i> <i> BUY THE FARMS</i> <i> REALIZED THE EARLY IMMIGRANTS</i> <i> NEEDED FURTHER ASSISTANCE.</i> THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH CAME THROUGH IN 1908 WHEN THEY ALSO STARTED TO PRODUCE A NEWSPAPER IN YIDDISH FOR FARMERS CALLED<i> THE JEWISH FARMER,</i> WHICH WAS THE FIRST YIDDISH AGRICULTURAL MAGAZINE IN THE WORLD. <i> MARY'S FRIEND AVI</i> <i> HAS AGREED TO HELP TRANSLATE</i> <i> SOME OF THE YIDDISH.</i> ALL RIGHT, HELP US OUT HERE. AND THE FIRST ARTICLE YOU HAVE IS HOW TO BEST UNDERSTAND YOUR COW, OR... [ speaks in Yiddish ] AND THEN IT GOES ON TO SAY IN YIDDISH WHAT EVERY FARMER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEIR COW. [ speaking in Yiddish ] EVERY JEWISH FARMER WHO HAS EYES HAS NOTICED THAT SOME COWS GIVE MILK BETTER AND SOME COWS GIVE MILK WORSE. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS THIS HOW-TO GUIDE FOR JEWISH FARMERS, EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO BE A FARMER, ALL THE BASICS, WRITTEN IN YIDDISH. MARY, WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM<i> THE JEWISH FARMER,</i> HOW DID THEY DO? THEY DID GREAT. IN 1908, IT ONLY HAD 638 SUBSCRIBERS, AND FIVE YEARS LATER, IT HAD THOUSANDS. IN CONNECTICUT, JEWISH FARMERS DEVELOPED A NICHE MARKET FOR THINGS LIKE TOBACCO, POULTRY, EGGS, DAIRY, AND SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION JEWISH FARMERS REALLY PROSPERED. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T MAKE IT AND THEY WENT BACK TO THE CITY, BUT OTHER PEOPLE WERE SMART AND THEY FOUND OTHER WAYS TO MAKE MONEY, AND THEY TURNED THEIR FARMS INTO EITHER BOARDING HOUSES OR WEEKEND RESORTS, SO MUCH SO, THAT AT ONE TIME, THIS AREA WAS CALLED THE CATSKILLS OF NEW ENGLAND. THE IDEA THAT THIS HOUSE WAS MORE THAN A HOUSE, THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SANCTUARY FOR PEOPLE, I MEAN, THAT'S JUST FANTASTIC. WELL, IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. FOR MORE OF MY INTERVIEW WITH DANIEL SAWYER, VISIT<i> HISTORY DETECTIVES</i> ON THE WEB AT pbs.org. THE TOWN OF WILLIAMSBURG IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, ALSO SAW AN INFLUX OF JEWISH RESIDENTS AT THE TURN OF THE 20th CENTURY THANKS TO AN INCREDIBLE FEAT OF AMERICAN ENGINEERING. CONSTRUCTION ON THE WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE, NEW YORK'S SECOND GREAT SUSPENSION BRIDGE, BEGAN ON NOVEMBER 7th, 1896. TO ALLEVIATE THE TRAFFIC OVERWHELMING THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, ITS DESIGN CALLED FOR A DOUBLE-DECKER ROADWAY FOR CARRIAGES, TROLLEYS, AND PEDESTRIANS. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT TWO LEVELS OF TRAFFIC, 310-FOOT-HIGH TOWERS WERE ERECTED, THE FIRST EVER MADE ENTIRELY OF STEEL. BUILT IN HALF THE TIME OF THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AND MEASURING FOUR AND A HALF FEET LONGER, THE WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE STOLE THE TITLE OF THE LONGEST SUSPENSION BRIDGE IN THE WORLD WHEN IT OPENED ON DECEMBER 19, 1903. JEWISH RESIDENTS OF MANHATTAN'S CROWDED EAST SIDE TENEMENTS STREAMED OVER THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART BRIDGE TO FIND NEW HOMES IN SPACIOUS BROOKLYN. THE BRAND-NEW LINK BETWEEN THE THEN-SEPARATE CITIES OF NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN ALSO PROVIDED A FINAL IMPETUS FOR THEM TO CONSOLIDATE. IN 1898, THEY JOINED WITH QUEENS, STATEN ISLAND, AND THE BRONX TO BECOME THE SINGLE UNITED CITY OF NEW YORK. Tukufu: <i> OUR LAST STORY INVESTIGATES</i> <i> THE CONNECTION</i> <i> BETWEEN A PORTRAIT, A POET,</i> <i> AND THE FALL OF AN EMPIRE.</i> <i> IN 1923, THE LEBANESE-BORN</i> <i> POET KHALIL GIBRAN</i> <i> PUBLISHES</i> THE PROPHET, <i> A COLLECTION OF POEMS</i> <i> EXPLORING FACETS OF LIFE</i> <i> AND THE HUMAN CONDITION.</i> <i> ALTHOUGH VIEWED SKEPTICALLY</i> <i> BY CRITICS,</i> <i> IT WILL BECOME</i> <i> A LITERARY SENSATION,</i> <i> MAKING KHALIL GIBRAN ONE OF</i> <i> THE WORLD'S BESTSELLING POETS</i> <i> AND HAVING</i> <i> A POWERFUL IMPACT</i> <i> ON THE COUNTERCULTURE OF THE</i> <i> 1960s AND THE NEW-AGE MOVEMENT.</i> <i> BUT MANY ARE UNAWARE</i> <i> THAT THE WRITER</i> <i> WAS ALSO</i> <i> A PROLIFIC PAINTER,</i> <i> CAPTURING CELEBRITIES</i> <i> AND FAMOUS FIGURES</i> <i> OF THE 20th CENTURY</i> <i> ON CANVAS.</i> <i> NOW, ALMOST EIGHT DECADES</i> <i> AFTER GIBRAN'S DEATH,</i> <i> BOB DIAB FROM OVERLAND PARK,</i> <i> KANSAS, HAS A PORTRAIT</i> <i> THAT HE THINKS MAY HAVE BEEN</i> <i> PAINTED BY GIBRAN.</i> [ doorbell rings ] HELLO, I'M TUKUFU. I'M BOB. PLEASE COME IN. WOW, SO WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER, NAJEEB MUSA DIAB. HE WAS A PUBLISHER OF AN ARABIC NEWSPAPER IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY. JUST AFTER HE IMMIGRATED HERE FROM SYRIA. AND WHICH PAPER WAS THAT? IT WAS CALLED <i> THE MIRROR OF THE WEST.</i> <i> BOB SAYS HIS</i> <i> GRANDFATHER'S NEWSPAPER</i> <i> WAS ONCE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE</i> <i> FOR ARAB IMMIGRANTS,</i> <i> A FAMILIAR VOICE</i> <i> REPORTING ON CHANGING EVENTS</i> <i> IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES</i> <i> AND ON LIFE WITHIN</i> <i> ARAB IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES</i> <i> IN THE UNITED STATES.</i> <i> HE PUBLISHED GIBRAN'S POEMS</i> <i> IN HIS NEWSPAPER,</i> <i> GIVING THE POET</i> <i> A PROMINENT VOICE</i> <i> IN THE ISOLATED</i> <i> ARAB COMMUNITY.</i> WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PAINTING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT? THE STORY IS THAT IT WAS PAINTED BY KHALIL GIBRAN. NOW, I KNOW OF HIM AS A VERY FAMOUS WRITER, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HE DID PAINTINGS. YES. ESPECIALLY PORTRAITS. YES. AND I KNOW THAT HE... <i> BOB TELLS ME A COUSIN</i> <i> HE HASN'T SEEN IN MANY YEARS</i> <i> ONCE HAD A DRAWING</i> <i> SIGNED BY THE POET.</i> <i> ALTHOUGH THE PAINTING</i> <i> OF BOB'S GRANDFATHER</i> <i> IS NOT SIGNED, THERE ARE</i> <i> SOME POTENTIAL CLUES.</i> WHAT IS THIS MEDAL HERE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT? I DO NOT KNOW. AND THIS HERE, THIS IS A WATCH, RIGHT? <i> BOB HAS A TIMEPIECE</i> <i> THAT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN</i> <i> THROUGH HIS FAMILY</i> <i> WHICH HE THINKS MAY BE</i> <i> THE SAME WATCH</i> <i> IN THE PAINTING.</i> THIS POCKET WATCH WAS PRESENTED TO MY GRANDFATHER WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY IN 1914 TO 1915. FINE TIMEPIECE. THANK YOU. <i> BOB SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH</i> <i> HIS GRANDFATHER</i> <i> IMMIGRATED TO</i> <i> THE UNITED STATES,</i> <i> HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE</i> <i> TO THE CAUSE OF INDEPENDENCE</i> <i> FOR SYRIA AND LEBANON.</i> <i> BOTH WERE STILL PART</i> <i> OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE,</i> <i> WHICH HAD RULED THOSE LANDS</i> <i> FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS.</i> SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT FOR YOU? WELL, COULD IT HAVE BEEN PAINTED BY KHALIL GIBRAN AND ANY BACKGROUND ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER. <i> THE PORTRAIT IS TOO LARGE</i> <i> TO CARRY WITH ME,</i> <i> SO I'M GOING TO TAKE</i> <i> SOME PHOTOS.</i> <i> I READ KHALIL GIBRAN</i> <i> IN COLLEGE,</i> <i> BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH</i> <i> ABOUT HIS ARTWORK.</i> <i> I'M HEADING INTO BROOKLYN,</i> <i> NEW YORK, HOME TO A LARGE</i> <i> AND LONG-STANDING</i> <i> ARAB-AMERICAN COMMUNITY,</i> <i> TO SHOW BOB'S PAINTING</i> <i> TO A KHALIL GIBRAN SCHOLAR,</i> <i> GREGORY ORFALEA.</i> WELCOME. <i> GREG SAYS MUCH OF GIBRAN'S</i> <i> WRITING AND PAINTING</i> <i> REFLECTS HIS IDENTITY</i> <i> AS AN IMMIGRANT</i> <i> IN A FOREIGN LAND.</i> I THINK HIS EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA WAS ONE OF ALIENATION. IT WAS A LONELY EXPERIENCE LINGUISTICALLY. HE DIDN'T KNOW ENGLISH. HE WAS NOT IN BEAUTIFUL, VERDANT, SNOWY MT. LEBANON, HE WAS LIVING IN THE TENEMENTS IN GRIMY BOSTON, SOUTH BOSTON, WEST ROXBURY. <i> GREG EXPLAINS THAT GIBRAN</i> <i> ARRIVED IN BOSTON IN 1895</i> <i> AT THE AGE OF 12.</i> <i> HIS FAMILY WAS PART</i> <i> OF AN ENORMOUS INFLUX</i> <i> OF MOSTLY POOR IMMIGRANTS</i> <i> WHO ARRIVED</i> <i> AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY</i> <i> FROM LEBANON AND SYRIA</i> <i> TO PLACES SUCH AS</i> <i> BROOKLYN, NEW YORK,</i> <i> AND SOUTH BOSTON.</i> <i> HIS FIRST POETRY</i> <i> WAS IN ARABIC</i> <i> AND OFTEN ADDRESSED YOUNG</i> <i> IMMIGRANTS LIKE HIMSELF</i> <i> STRUGGLING TO FIND THEIR WAY</i> <i> IN THE UNITED STATES.</i> HE WROTE POEMS TO TELL YOUNG SYRIAN AMERICANS TO BE PROUD OF THEIR HERITAGE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FEEL THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO GIVE OF MAGNITUDE. <i> IN 1923, HE PUBLISHED</i> <i> A COLLECTION</i> <i> OF 26 ENGLISH PROSE POEMS</i> <i> ABOUT A MYSTICAL SPIRITUAL</i> <i> LEADER,</i> THE PROPHET. <i> IN IT, GIBRAN EXPLORED SUBJECTS</i> <i> LIKE LOVE, BEAUTY, AND GIVING.</i> <i> YOU GIVE BUT LITTLE WHEN</i> <i> YOU GIVE OF YOUR POSSESSIONS.</i> <i> IT IS WHEN YOU GIVE OF YOURSELF</i> <i> THAT YOU TRULY GIVE.</i> <i> THE UNIQUE BLEND OF EAST</i> <i> AND WEST THINKING</i> <i> HAS SOLD MILLIONS</i> <i> OF COPIES.</i> THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF<i> THE PROPHET</i> THAT ARE VERY INTERESTING, AND SOME OF THE APHORISMS THAT ARE DIFFERENT. WORK IS LOVE MADE VISIBLE. IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STYLE OF WRITING THAN WAS GOING ON RIGHT THEN AND THERE WITH THE AMERICANS. <i> BUT GREG BELIEVES THAT,</i> <i> IRONICALLY,</i> THE PROPHET'S<i> COMMERCIAL</i> <i> SUCCESS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED</i> <i> TO GIBRAN'S MIXED REVIEWS</i> <i> FROM CRITICS.</i> AND ALSO YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT ANOTHER REASON WAS THAT THEY JUST SIMPLY DID NOT TRANSLATE HIS TOUGHER, MORE REBELLIOUS, PRINCIPLED POLITICAL WORK THAT WAS PUBLISHED PRIOR TO<i> THE PROPHET.</i> WE TRANSLATED A POEM OF HIS THAT HAD NEVER SEEN ENGLISH, DEFEAT, MY DEFEAT. THAT MATERIAL SHOWS A MORE POLITICAL, MORE DEFIANT, MORE SOCIALLY ENGAGED GIBRAN. I'LL READ JUST A BIT OF IT. DEFEAT, MY DEFEAT, MY SHINING SWORD AND SHIELD. IN YOUR EYES I HAVE READ THAT TO BE ENTHRONED IS TO BE ENSLAVED, AND WE SHALL STAND IN THE SUN WITH A WILL AND WE SHALL BE DANGEROUS. SALMA JAYYUSI, THE PALESTINIAN CRITIC, SAYS THAT HE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LITERARY FIGURE IN THE ARAB WORLD IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20th CENTURY. THAT'S BIG. <i> I TELL GREG ABOUT</i> <i> MY INVESTIGATION.</i> SO I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KHALIL GIBRAN AND NAJEEB DIAB. CAN YOU TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DIAB? WELL, HE WAS A LEADER OF THE COMMUNITY AS A JOURNALIST. HE WAS A LEADER OF THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY. IT WAS FOR FREEDOM FOR SYRIA FROM OTTOMAN TURKEY. HE WAS A HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN. <i> GREG CONFIRMS BOTH MEN</i> <i> KNEW EACH OTHER</i> <i> AND MOVED</i> <i> IN SIMILAR CIRCLES,</i> <i> EACH SPEAKING IN FAVOR</i> <i> OF INDEPENDENCE</i> <i> FOR SYRIA AND LEBANON.</i> <i> LIKE GIBRAN, NAJEEB DIAB</i> <i> WAS PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED</i> <i> BY AMERICAN IDEAS OF POLITICAL</i> <i> LIBERTY AND FREE SPEECH.</i> THESE PEOPLE HAD COME TO AMERICA, THEY HAD TASTED THE FRUITS OF DEMOCRACY AND SECULARISM. MOST OF THEM LIKED WHAT THEY SAW AND LIKED WHAT THEY TASTED. THEY WANTED TO SEE IT IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. <i> BUT GREG'S NOT SURE</i> <i> IF GIBRAN EVER PAINTED THIS.</i> IT'S ALMOST TOO REALISTIC. THERE'S NO PRE-RAPHAELITE LIGHT AND MISTINESS ABOUT IT THAT YOU SAW IN GIBRAN'S PAINTINGS. <i> HE SAYS THE LARGEST</i> <i> PUBLIC COLLECTION</i> <i> OF GIBRAN PAINTINGS</i> <i> IN THE U.S.</i> <i> IS AT THE TELFAIR MUSEUM</i> <i> IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA,</i> <i> SO I'M ARRANGING</i> <i> TO HAVE BOB'S PORTRAIT</i> <i> SHIPPED THERE</i> <i> FOR COMPARISON.</i> <i> MEANWHILE, I'M GOING TO TRY</i> <i> TO TRACK DOWN BOB'S COUSIN,</i> <i> WHOM HE HAD SAID ONCE OWNED</i> <i> ARTWORK SIGNED BY GIBRAN.</i> <i> EVENTUALLY, I LOCATE</i> <i> ROBERT MADEY</i> <i> ON LONG ISLAND</i> <i> NEAR NEW YORK CITY.</i> <i> ROBERT IS ALSO A GRANDSON</i> <i> OF THE MAN IN BOB'S PORTRAIT,</i> <i> NAJEEB DIAB.</i> WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SKETCH THAT KHALIL GIBRAN DID AND SIGNED. I DO, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT... <i> ROBERT SHOWS ME</i> <i> THE SKETCH OF HIS AUNT SELMA.</i> <i> THE WOMAN IS NAJEEB DIAB'S</i> <i> DAUGHTER.</i> <i> HE SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH</i> <i> THE ORIGINAL HAS BEEN SOLD,</i> <i> THERE'S NO DOUBT</i> <i> WHO DREW IT.</i> MY LOVE TO SELMA DIAB FROM GIBRAN GIBRAN. WOW, VERY, VERY INTERESTING. WELL, GIBRAN AND MY GRANDFATHER WERE FRIENDS. <i> ROBERT EXPLAINS</i> <i> THAT KHALIL GIBRAN</i> <i> WAS CLOSE TO HIS</i> <i> ENTIRE FAMILY,</i> <i> SHARING POLITICAL</i> <i> AND ARTISTIC INTERESTS.</i> THEY WERE FOUNDERS OF A SOCIETY CALLED AL-RABITAH, AND THAT ORGANIZATION WAS FORMED TO PROMOTE AND PERPETUATE THE ARABIC LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AND LITERATURE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND MY FATHER, IN FACT, DELIVERED A EULOGY TO GIBRAN WHEN HE PASSED AWAY. I'M DOING AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT IF KHALIL GIBRAN COULD HAVE ACTUALLY PAINTED THIS PORTRAIT. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS BEFORE? I HAVE. I HAVE THE ORIGINAL PHOTO FROM WHICH THIS PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED. THIS IS AMAZING. THE TWIST IN THE HAIR IS AT THE EXACT SAME PLACE, THE TIE IS THE SAME, THE COAT IS THE SAME, THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS ARE THE SAME. DO YOU KNOW WHEN THIS PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN? NO, BUT I THINK IT WAS DONE PROBABLY IN CONNECTION WITH A CONFERENCE HE ATTENDED IN PARIS IN 1913. IT MAY HAVE BEEN DONE JUST PRIOR TO OR JUST AFTERWARDS. <i> ROBERT SAYS HIS GRANDFATHER</i> <i> ATTENDED</i> <i> A MAJOR CONFERENCE IN PARIS</i> <i> JUST BEFORE WORLD WAR I</i> <i> AS THE HEAD OF</i> <i> THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY.</i> <i> DELEGATES FROM ARAB NATIONS</i> <i> AND OTHER IMMIGRANT GROUPS</i> <i> WERE DEBATING THE BEST WAY</i> <i> OF ENDING TURKISH RULE</i> <i> IN SYRIA AND LEBANON.</i> <i> THE WATCH BOB SHOWED ME</i> <i> WAS ALSO FROM</i> <i> THE UNITED SYRIAN SOCIETY</i> <i> AND MAY WELL BE THE SAME WATCH</i> <i> IN THE PORTRAIT.</i> <i> HAD GIBRAN PAINTED</i> <i> THIS IMAGE OF HIS FRIEND</i> <i> TO COMMEMORATE</i> <i> THIS IMPORTANT MOMENT?</i> <i> BOB'S SKEPTICAL THE PAINTING</i> <i> WAS DONE BY GIBRAN --</i> <i> THE STYLE IS SO DIFFERENT</i> <i> FROM THE IMAGE OF HIS AUNT --</i> <i> BUT HE CAN'T BE CERTAIN.</i> IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT HE COULD'VE DONE A COPY. <i> BOB'S PAINTING HAS ARRIVED</i> <i> AT THE TELFAIR MUSEUM,</i> <i> WHERE I'M MEETING CURATOR</i> <i> TANIA SAMMONS.</i> WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THIS PAINTING WAS DONE BY GIBRAN. WELL, KHALIL GIBRAN ACTUALLY WAS FIRST KNOWN FOR HIS ARTWORK. <i> TANIA TELLS ME</i> <i> THAT GIBRAN'S TALENT</i> <i> WON THE ATTENTION</i> <i> OF BOSTON'S ART COMMUNITY</i> <i> WHILE HE WAS STILL</i> <i> A TEEN.</i> <i> A SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS</i> <i> NAMED MARY HASKELL</i> <i> BECAME HIS PATRON</i> <i> AND EVENTUALLY HIS LOVER.</i> <i> SHE SENT HIM TO STUDY ART</i> <i> AT THE ACADEMIE JULIAN IN PARIS</i> <i> AND HAD A PROFOUND INFLUENCE</i> <i> ON HIS LIFE.</i> IN 1911, SHE HELPED HIM SET UP A STUDIO IN NEW YORK CITY. SHE REALLY ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE OFF, BOTH IN HIS WRITING AND VISUAL CAREERS. SO NOT ONLY DID SHE ENCOURAGE HIM TO WRITE IN ENGLISH, BUT SHE HELPED HIM LEARN THE LANGUAGE, SHE EDITED HIS WORK AS WELL. NOW, DOES THE LACK OF A SIGNATURE TELL US ANYTHING? KHALIL GIBRAN DID SIGN HIS PIECES, BUT HE DIDN'T SIGN EVERYTHING. HOWEVER, I WOULD SAY THE STYLE OF PAINTING IS NOT TYPICAL FOR KHALIL GIBRAN. <i> TANIA SHOWS ME A SERIES</i> <i> OF PAINTINGS BY GIBRAN,</i> <i> AND AT FIRST GLIMPSE,</i> <i> HIS WORKS DO NOT RESEMBLE</i> <i> THE DIAB PORTRAIT.</i> YOU CAN SEE HOW HE IS NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES OF A PERSON. IT'S VERY FLUID. YEAH. DO YOU HAVE ANY OIL PAINTINGS LIKE OURS WHICH ARE A PORTRAIT? I HAVE A GOOD COMPARISON. IT'S A SELF-PORTRAIT OF KHALIL GIBRAN. <i> THE STYLE OF THIS PORTRAIT</i> <i> IS ALSO QUITE DIFFERENT</i> <i> FROM BOB'S.</i> IN THIS PAINTING, GIBRAN'S BRUSH STROKES ARE VERY EVIDENT. THEY'RE MUCH FREER. YOU CAN SEE INDIVIDUAL COLORS IN THE PAINTING AND HIS FACE ISN'T DELINEATED LIKE THE IMAGE OF MR. DIAB. <i> I EXPLAIN THAT BOB'S PORTRAIT</i> <i> MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO</i> <i> WITH NAJEEB DIAB ATTENDING</i> <i> A MAJOR CONFERENCE</i> <i> IN PARIS IN 1913.</i> <i> TANIA SAYS THAT</i> <i> DURING THAT PERIOD,</i> <i> GIBRAN DID A NUMBER</i> <i> OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS</i> <i> OF IMPORTANT ARTISTS</i> <i> AND THINKERS.</i> <i> HE CALLED IT</i> <i> THE TEMPLE OF ART SERIES.</i> CERTAINLY MR. DIAB WOULD HAVE FIT WITHIN THAT SERIES. AND SO IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN UNCALLED FOR FOR DIAB TO REQUEST A PARTICULAR TYPE OF PORTRAIT FROM GIBRAN. YEAH, CERTAINLY NOT. IT'S TYPICAL FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMISSION PORTRAITS TO GUIDE THE ARTIST ON HOW THEY WOULD LIKE FOR THE PORTRAIT TO BE PAINTED. <i> DOES BOB HAVE A PREVIOUSLY</i> <i> UNKNOWN PAINTING</i> <i> FROM THE</i> <i> TEMPLE OF ART SERIES?</i> <i> TANIA SUGGESTS THAT IF DIAB</i> <i> HAD COMMISSIONED THE WORK,</i> <i> GIBRAN MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT</i> <i> IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE</i> <i> WITH HIS LOVER,</i> <i> MARY HASKELL.</i> LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING ABOUT THE TEMPLE OF ART HERE. <i> THERE ARE REFERENCES</i> <i> TO MANY OF THE LUMINARIES</i> <i> THAT GIBRAN DREW</i> <i> OR PAINTED,</i> <i> INCLUDING PSYCHOTHERAPIST</i> <i> CARL JUNG,</i> <i> IRISH POET</i> <i> WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,</i> <i> AND THE LEGENDARY ACTRESS</i> <i> SARAH BERNHARDT.</i> LISTEN TO THIS: AT LAST, THE DIVINE SARAH IS CAUGHT. THIS IS A REFERENCE TO SARAH BERNHARDT. BUT IF I AM TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS WITH OTHER GREAT MEN AND WOMEN, I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP ART AND BECOME A DIPLOMAT. OKAY, HERE IS A REFERENCE TO DIAB. <i> I'VE DISCOVERED</i> <i> A CURIOUS NOTE</i> <i> IN THE HASKELL LETTERS.</i> <i> I THINK I FINALLY HAVE</i> <i> SOME ANSWERS FOR BOB.</i> BOB, THIS INVESTIGATION HAS ALLOWED US TO GAIN SOME INSIGHT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR GRANDFATHER AND KHALIL GIBRAN. I SPOKE TO AN EXPERT ON HIS ARTWORK, AND SHE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THIS PAINTING IS NOT THE WORK OF KHALIL GIBRAN. <i> I EXPLAIN TO BOB</i> <i> THAT TO MAKE CERTAIN,</i> <i> I CONSULTED THE LETTERS</i> <i> AND DIARIES OF MARY HASKELL.</i> AND IT IS THAT SEARCH WHICH LED ME TO ONE OF MY MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES. OKAY, HERE IS A REFERENCE TO DIAB. IT'S QUITE POLITICAL, AND THIS IS REFERRING TO THE 1913 PARIS CONFERENCE. DIAB AND MYSELF WERE ASKED TO GO AS REPRESENTATIVES. THE IDEA IS FINE, BUT AFTER TALKING THINGS OVER WITH A COMMITTEE OF SYRIANS, I FOUND THAT WE DO NOT AGREE ON ANY POINT. DIAB THINKS I AM MAD -
- OTHERS THINK SO, TOO. IT HAS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT HIM DOING A SKETCH OR A PORTRAIT OF DIAB. <i> I TELL BOB THAT GIBRAN</i> <i> HAD REFUSED TO ATTEND</i> <i> THE 1913 PARIS CONFERENCE</i> <i> BECAUSE HE HAD</i> <i> FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES</i> <i> WITH OTHER ATTENDEES,</i> <i> INCLUDING NAJEEB DIAB.</i> <i> SO IT SEEMS UNLIKELY</i> <i> THAT GIBRAN WOULD</i> <i> PAINT A PORTRAIT</i> <i> IN COMMEMORATION</i> <i> OF THE EVENT.</i> THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR GRANDFATHER AND KHALIL GIBRAN WAS NOT ONLY OVER ISSUES OF WRITING AND ART, IT WENT TO THE HEART OF THEIR POLITICAL COMMITMENT AND WAS A REFLECTION ON THE EARLY ARAB-AMERICAN POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S QUITE INTERESTING. I NEVER REALIZED THAT THEY WERE EVEN IN POLITICS, MY GRANDFATHER OR KHALIL GIBRAN. IT'S THE ONLY PICTURE I HAVE OF MY GRANDFATHER, AND I'LL STILL KEEP IT AND CHERISH IT AT HOME. I THANK YOU. <i> IN THE 1960s,</i> <i> A GENERATION HUNGRY FOR CHANGE</i> <i> WAS CAPTIVATED</i> <i> BY PASSAGES FROM</i> THE PROPHET, <i> LIKE LOVE POSSESSES NOT</i> <i> NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED;</i> <i> FOR LOVE IS SUFFICIENT</i> <i> UNTO LOVE.</i> <i> IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A DIFFERENT</i> <i> WAY OF THINKING AND LIVING,</i> <i> MANY YOUNG, DISILLUSIONED</i> <i> AMERICANS</i> <i> TURNED TO THE TEACHINGS</i> <i> OF THE EAST.</i> <i> THE IDEAS EXPRESSED</i> <i> IN</i> THE PROPHET <i> MIRRORED THEIR STRUGGLE OF</i> <i> THE SPIRIT AGAINST MATERIALISM.</i> <i> KHALIL GIBRAN</i> <i> BECAME A VOICE</i> <i> FOR THE</i> <i> COUNTERCULTURE MOVEMENT.</i> <i> BUT GIBRAN</i> <i> NEVER LIVED</i> <i> TO SEE HIS WORDS INSPIRE</i> <i> THAT GENERATION OF AMERICANS.</i> <i> HE DIED OF CIRRHOSIS</i> <i> OF THE LIVER</i> <i> FROM ALCOHOLISM</i> <i> IN 1931.</i> And so, my fellow Americans... Elyse: PRESIDENT KENNEDY IS BELIEVED TO HAVE PARAPHRASED KHALIL GIBRAN'S WRITING WHEN HE SAID: Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. [ cheering and applause ] JFK WAS ALSO FOND OF QUOTING FROM ROBERT FROST AND EVEN HAD THE POET READ AT HIS INAUGURATION. IT'S RARE THAT POETRY AND POLITICS MIX, BUT SOMETIMES TRAGEDY BRINGS THE TWO TOGETHER. FOLLOWING THE DISASTER THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF SEVEN ASTRONAUTS ABOARD THE SPACE SHUTTLE<i> CHALLENGER</i> ON JANUARY 28, 1986, RONALD REAGAN ADDRESSED THE NATION. We will never forget them. WHEN HE ENDED HIS REMARKS BY SAYING THE ASTRONAUTS HAD... Slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God. HE WAS BORROWING FROM THE FIRST AND LAST LINE OF HIGH FLIGHT. THE POEM WAS WRITTEN IN 1941 BY A 19-YEAR-OLD PILOT OFFICER, JOHN GILLESPIE MAGEE, JR., ON THE BACK OF A LETTER TO HIS MOTHER JUST A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE WAS KILLED. WHEN MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., WAS ASSASSINATED, BOBBY KENNEDY WENT BACK 2,500 YEARS TO THE GREEK POET AESCHYLUS TO GIVE VOICE TO HIS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. Kennedy: Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.
