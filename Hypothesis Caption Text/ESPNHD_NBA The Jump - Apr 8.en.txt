 INCREDIBLE.
 TRULY INCREDIBLE.
 WASN'T SURE IF HE BE ABLE TO
 WALK AGAIN.
 WHAT INSPIRATION.
 THAT'S THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN
 THIS YEAR.
 YES.
 NO QUESTION.
 IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RYAN

 ALL RIGHT. WELCOME TO "THE JUMP"
 PRESENTED BY MICHELIN WIPER
 BLADES.
 TODAY'S OPENING TIP, ONE MR.
 ALEX CARUSO■AAA■■p TRYING BUT CO
 DO YOU THINK -WHO IS THE
 HARDEST PLAYER NK ON IN THE
 LEAGUE?
 I THINK RUDY IS THE HARDEST
 PLAYENK ON IN THE LEAGUE
 AT 7
 HASN'T BEEN A■UY LIKE HIM IN A
 LONG TIME.
 THAT IS NOT A MOUNTAIN YOU
 WANT TO CLI
 WELCOME TO "THE JUMP."
 I'M ■I■L5) NICHOLS LOOK SIDE
 NBA CHAMP, FORMER COACH OF THE ■
 YEAR BYRON SCOTT.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
 US.
 COMING UP, WE'RE GOING TO BE
 TALKING ABOUT THE BUCKS BECOMING
 THE ONLY TEAM IN THE NBA THIS
 SEASON TO HIT THE 60-GAME WIN
 MARK.
 IS THAT SOMETHING, NOTHING, OR
 EVERYTHING?
 WE'LL DISCUSS IN A MOMENT.
 BUT FIRST, VINCE LOMBARDI IS
 CREDITED FOR SAYING WINNING
 ISN'T EVERYTHING, IT'S THE ONLY
 THING.
 PERSONALLY, I WOULD BEG TO
 DIFFER WITH THAT ON A NUMBER OF
 LEVELS, BUT HERE'S WHAT I KNOW
 FOR SURE.
 VINCE LOMBARDI DIDN'T PLAY IN
 THE NBA DURING THE GOLDEN STATE
 ERA.
 TO SAY THE WARRIORS HAVE BEEN
 SMOTHERING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
 THEY HAVE WON THREE OF THE LAST
 FOUR TITLES, CAN THROW OUT A
 STARTING UNIT OF FIVE ALL-STARS,
 PLUS FEATURE THE GREATEST
 SHOOTER OF ALL TIME, AND THAT
 WAS BEFORE HE GOT CONTACT
 LENSES.
 SO WHILE, YES, ABSOLUTELY THERE
 ARE OTHER TEAMS THAT COULD MAYBE
 POSSIBLY WIN THE TITLE THIS
 YEAR, LET'S FACE IT.
 THE WARRIORS ARE STILL THE
 OVERWHELMING FAVORITE.
 WHICH MEANS THAT IN A LEAGUE OF
 NEARLY 500 PLAYERS,BUT 15
 EM NEED TO RECONCILE
 THEMSELVES THAT WINNING MAY NOT,
 IN FACT, BE THE  T
 MAYBE THAT IS WHY AS THIS NBA
 LAST FINAL BREATH, WE ARE SEEING
 SUCH A STRONG ATTEMPT TO
 MANIPULATE THE PLAYOFF BRACKET
 WITH THE IDEA, I GUESS, THAT IF
 BEING THE LAST TEAM STANDING
 DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SUPER
 LIKELY OPTION, YOU AT LEAST WANT
 TO BE STANDING AS LONG AS
 POSSIBLE.
 AND WITH THAT, LET'S GO TO
 PORTLAND, SHALL WE?
 YOU'D THINK LAST NIGHT THE
 NUGGETS WOULD BE TRYING TO BEAT
 THLAZERS BECAUSE IT IS A
 BASKETBALL GAME AFTER ALLTEAD,
 PLAYER.
 DENVER SAT JAMAL MURRAY.
 DENVE PAUL M.HAT'S TWO-THIRDS O
 STARTING LINEUP.
 I GUESS THAT COULD BE FOR REST,
 AS THE TEAM TALKED ABOUT.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TEAM'S
 OTHER TWO REGULAR STARTERS, GAR.
 BUT THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO PLAY
 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
 THE NUGGETS ACTUALLY HAD A
 SEVEN-POINT LEAD IN THIS GAME
 WITH 4:30 TO PLAY.
 COACH MIKE MALONE STILL WOULDN'T
 PUT HARRIS OR BARTON IN TO HELP
 SEAL THE WIN.
 AS A RESULT, THE NUGGETS  IN
 FACT, COUGH UP THE E, WHICH I
  TO SAY  LEAST SEEMS LIKE
 IT WAS THE INTENTION.
 WHY?
 WELL, HERE ARE THE STANDINGS AS
 OF TODAY.
 THE ROCKETS, THEY'RE IN THIRD
 RIGHT NOW.
 BY PROPPING UP PORTLAND, DENVER
 HOPES TO MOVE TO THREE, WHICH
 WOULD KICK HOUSTON TO THE NUMBER
 FOUR SPOT AND KEEP THE NUGGETS
 FROM HAVING TO SEE HOUSTON IN
 THE SECOND ROUND.
 DENVER DID JUST LOSE TO THE
 ROCK NEARLY 30 THE OTHER
 DAY.
 SO I CAN SEE WHY THE NUGGETS
 WOULD BE FEELING A LITTLE SHELL
 SHOCKED.
 IT'S NOT A GOOD MATCFOR ■
 ■KY GAME DENVER
 IS PLAYING
 THE ROCKETS STILLOL THEIR
 O STAY OUT O
 SO YEAH, HOUSTON COULD DROP TO
 NUMBER FOUR, BUT THANKS TO
 DENVER, LET'S CALL IT, I DON'T
 KNOW, LET'S SAY NOT REALLY GOING
 FOR IT IN PORTLAND LAST NIGHT.
 NOW HOUSTON ALSO HAS THE CHANCE
 TO GRAB THE NUMBER TWO SEED IF
 EVENTS THE NEXT COUPLE NIGHTS
 FALL THEIR WAY, WHICH MEANS
 DENVER COULD STILL HAVE THAT
 UNFAVORABLE MATCHUP AND NOT HAVE
 HOME COURT.
 THAT ASSUMES DENVER GETHE
 D RCE
 NUGGETS DROP TO THREE, THEY'LL
 BE FACING A HIGHER SEED IN THE
 FIRST ROUND.
 I GET IT.
 THE NUGGETS DIDN'T MAKE THE
 YOFFS LAST YEA
 GETTING TO THE CON■■IT
 STORY.
 OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND THE
 INSTINCT TO TRY TO STACK THE
 DECK IN FAVOR OF THAT.
 THE PROBLEM IS WHILE WINNING MAY
 NOT BE THE ONLY THING, IT IS
 GENERALLY A GOOD THING IN PRO
 SPORTS.
 BY EFFECTIVELY TRYING TO LOSE
 LAST NIGHT, THE NUGGETS ARE
 TEMPTING THE BASKETBALL GODS,
 SOMETHING EVEN VINCE LOMBARDI
 WOULD TELL YOU IS DANGEROUS.
 BYRON, THERE'S A LOT TO PLAY
 FOR, SEEDINGWISE.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 HOW MUCH ATTENTION DID YOU GIVE
 IT AS A PLAYER, WHO YOU WERE
 GOING TO PLAY AND HOW THE
 BRACKET WOULD LOOK?
 I GAVE IT A LOT OF ATTENTION
 BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS A PLAYER,
 YOU KNOW THE TEAMS YOU HAVE A
 LOT OF SUCCESS AGAINST.
 YOU KNOW THE TEAMS YOU STRUGGLE
 AGAINST.
 IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO
 MEET THEM IN THE PLAYOFFS, YOU
 KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
 HAVE -YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID,
 IF I STRUGGLED AGAINST THEM, I
 KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A TOUGH
 SERIES.
 WE COULD HAVE STRUGGLED AGAINST
 THEM AS A TEAM AS WELL.
 I'M N TALKING ABOUT FROM
 AN INDIVIDUAL STANDPOINT.
 DENVEEASTING THEIR
 FAIT RIGHT HERE.
 THEY'RE MESSING WITH FIRE
 BECAUSE AGAIN, IF HOUSTON GETS
 UP TO THAT TWO SAND7AKES
 HOME DVANC&■)
 DENVER, MEETS THEM IN THE SECOND
 ROUND, I DON'T■HINK DENVER CAN
 BHEM IF THEY'RE THE HOME
 I THINK THAT'S GOING TOWITH .■
 TOUGH MATCHUP.
 I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO FACE
 THEM IN THE SECOND ROUND.
 THIS IS GOING TO BE -I KNOW
 THEY'RE HOPING THAT HOUSTON
 DROPS TO THAT FOUR SPOT SO
 HOUSTON HAS TO PLAY GOLDEN
 STATE.
 TO ME, YOU JUST TRY TO WIN EVERY
 GAME RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU CAN TO
 GET THAT MOMENTUM GOING INTO THE
 PLAYOFFS.
 I'M REMINDED OF THE 2006
 CLIPPERS WHO DROPPED ALL THE WAY
 TO THE SIXTH SO THEY COULD PLAY
 DENVER AT THE THREE BACK IN THE
 DAYS WHEN IF YOU WON YOUR
 DIVISION, YOU WOULD
 AUTOMATICALLY GET THERE.
 THEY BEAT DENVER.
 I'M NOT SURE THIS IS ENTIRELY
 WHAT DENVER IS DOING.
 NO, THEY CAME OUT AND SAID
 ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE SUPPOSED
 TO SAY.
 WE WANT TO GIVE OUR GUYS SOME
 REST.
 I DIDN'T PUT THOSE GUYS BACK IN
 THE END OF THE GAME BECAUSE THE
 BENCH GUYS WERE PLAYING SO WELL.
 LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY
 NIGHTMARE.
 WATCHING MARCUS SMART BE TAKEN
 BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM IN A
 MEANINGLESS GAME YESTERDAY
 AGAINST ORLANDO.
 MEANINGLESS AT LEAST FOR THE
 CELTICS, NOT ORLANDO.
 JASON TATUM, SHIN CONTUSION.
 THERE WAS A MOMENT YESTERDAY
 MORNING WHERE DANNY GREEN LOOKED
 LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE TWEAKED AN
 ANKLE LATE.
 I WONDER IF PUTTING GUYS IN
 BUBBLE WRAP -WOULD YOU RATHER
 HAVE YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR
 SEEDING?
 BYRON, YOU JUST SAID, HEY,
 I'M NOT SURE THEY COULD BEAT
 HOUSTON IN A POTENTIAL
 SECOND-ROUND MATCHUP ANYWAY.
 IF YOU THINK NO MATTER WHAT,
 HOME COURT OR NOT, YOU'RE NOT
 BEATING THAT TEAM, THERE'S
 SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR TRYING
 TO PROP UP PORTLAND TO TRY TO
 GET THEM IN THAT THIRD SEED TO
 AT LEAST TRY TO PLAY THEM IN THE
 SECOND ROUND IF EVERYTHING FALLS
 THAT WAY AND PUSH HOUSTON TO
 FOUR.
 I THINK THE NUGGETS SHOULD AT
 LEAST PRIORITIZE HOME COURT FOR
 AS LONG AS THEY CAN FOR AS FAR
 AS THEY CAN OVER WHO THEY'RE
 GOING TO PLAY.
 DENVER IS A REAL HOME COURT
 ADVANTAGE.
 NOT EVERY ARENA IN THIS LEAGUE
 IS A TRUE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE.
 DENVER IS, BUT MAYBE IF YOU
 DON'T THINK IT MATTERS O■■■■■■
 OR THE ■
 YAY BLAZERS,->RR■RR■■■TO GET TH
 UP THERE.
 FOR DENVER IT MATTERS.
 ALL SEASON LONG THEY'VE BEEN A
 GREAT HOME TEAM.
 KEVIN, TO YOUR POINT, BOSTON'S
 GAME DIDN'T MATTER.
 THEY PRETTY MUCH SOLIDIFIED
 THAT.
 THIS GAME MATTERED.
 DENVER AND PORTLAND, THAT GAME
 MATTERED.
 JUST LIKE RACHEL IS TALKING
 ABOUT, FOR DENVER ESPECIALLY,
 THEY TRY TO KEEP THAT TWO SEED.
 IT MATTERS.
 FOR ME, YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP
 THAT POSITION, YOU TRY TO WIN
 THESE GAMES NO MATTER WHAT WITH
 YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT WHAT'S
 GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW.
 YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT INJURIES
 AND ALL THAT STUFF.
 I GET THEY DO HAVE THEM, BUT AT
 THIS PARTICULAR POINT, LET'S TRY
 TO SECURE THAT TWO SPOT TO THE
 BEST OF OUR ABILITY, LET'S PLAY
 OUR GUYS, AND ?C■E■E■ITHEN, HEY
 IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE, IF WE
 HAVE THE TWO SPOT, GO FOR IT.
 I HAVE NOT BUGGED MIKE
 MALONE'S OFFICE.
 I CAN ONLY TAKE ON FACE VALUE
 WHAT HE SAID TO THE MEDIA, THAT
 THEY WERE TRYING TO WIN THE
 BASKETBALL GAME, BUT THEY ALSO
 SAT THREE OF THEIR STARTING FIVE
 AND THEN DIDN'T LET THE OTHER
 TWO PLAY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.m
 SO YOU JUST MAKE YOUR OWN
 CONCLUSIONS.
 I WANT TO REVISIT THE END OF THE
 REGULATION BETWEEN THAT
 HEAT/RAPTORS GAME ON SUNDAY.
 GAME TIED AT 103-103, TEN
 SECONDS.
 REFEREE ERIC LEWIS BLEW HIS
 WHISTLE, SO THE HEó■■■■■■■■■■■■N
 INTO POSITION.
 WADE, AS YOU SAW, RAN BACK,
 DIDN'T END UP GETTING THE BALL.
 JAMES JOHNSON MISSES HIS
 LAST-SECOND SHOT ATTEMPT.
 ERIC SPOELSTRA HERE, GO AHEAD.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE
 EXPLAINED TO ME.
 I WILL PROBABLY FOREVER HAVE TO
 AGREE TO DISAGREE.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 ERIC■■■■ HAD US ALL CONFUSED.
 HE BLEW THE WHISTLE.
 DWYANE HAD ALREADY MADE HIS CUT.
 THEN DEON STEPPED OUT  BOUNDS
 AND HANDED HIM THE BALL.
 YOU BLOW THE WHISTLE WHEN YOU
 HAND THE BALL TO SOMEBODY WHEN
 THEY'RE OUT OF BOUNDS, NOT
 BEFORE IT.
 I'M STILL FIXATED ON THAT AND A
 COUPLE OTHER CALLS.
 THESE 12:00 TIPS, THEY'RE NOT
 EASY FOR ANYBODY.
 GET SOME SLEEP.
 GET SOME REST.
 THESE THINGS■X; ; )  MATTER.
WOW.
 I THINK THAT WAS A VEILED SHOT
 AT OFFICIATING.
 IF YOU'RE OUT PARTYING THE NIGHT
 BEFORE, THIS IS A HUGE GAME FOR
 THE HEAT TO LOSE, OBVIOUSLY.
 THAT COULD END UP -WE COULD
 LOOK BACK ON THAT AND THAT COULD
 BE IT FOR THEM IN TERMS OF THE
 PLAYOFFS.
 THEY'RE ONE GAME OUT OF THE
 EIGHTH WITH TWO TO PLAY.
 IT'S A SMALL BEEF.
 YOU KNOW THIS.
 THAT WHISTLE, THE FOUR, THREE,
 TWO, ONE, IT TRIGGERS THE
 CHOREOGRAPHY.
 SO IF YOU MISS IT, AGAIN, HE'S
 ALREADY MADE HIS CUT, THE BALL
 WAS NOT IN THE INBOUNDER'S HAND.
 AM I RIGHT THERE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 THE ONE THING I WOULD ALWAYS
 TELL OUR PLAYERS, YOU DON'T
 MOVE -AS YOU SEE WHEN HE TAKES
 THE BALL OUT, WHEN SHE SLAPS THE
 BALL.
 YOU DON'T MOVE UNTIL HE SLAPS
 THE BALL.
 A LOT OF GUYS WANT TO SEE WHAT
 YOU'RE RUNNING ANYWAY.
 I USED TO ALWAYS TELL MY GUYS,
 WHEN THE REFEREE GIVES YOU THE
 BALL AND STAND STILL UNTIL YOU
 SEE HIM SLAP IT.
 ERIC IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
 THAT WAS A BAD JUDGMENT ON THE
 REFEREEART.
 AGAIN, YOU BLOW THE WHISTLE AND
 YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BALL
 THEN GIVE IT TO HIM TWO SECONDS
 LATER.
 THAT THROWS EVERYTHING OFF AS
 FAR AS MIAMI IS CONCERNED.
 THAT WHOLE RHYTHM WAS THROWN
 OFF.
 wANADE TO GET THE BALL
 BECAUSE HE'S GOING GET KAWHI
 LEONARD.
 THIS WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING
 SPECIAL.
 ARGUABLY MAYBE HIS LAST EVER
 FINAL POSSESSION, TIE GAME
 INSIDE OF 15 SECONDS.
 HE'S RIGHT.
 REES, WE TALK ABOUT THE
 PLAYERS ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY
 GO TO SOUTH BEACH AND L.A.
 IT WAS TORONTO.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 CH HAS A GREAT NIGHT LIFE ■■■■■.
 REFEREES, ■■ TO GET
 SLEEP TOO.
■■■■ OKAY.
 BUT I DO AGREE WITH HIM.
 I DO SEE IT.
 I OF COURSE SEE THAT RAN EARLY,
 BUT KIND OF LIKE THE NCAA GAME
 THE NIGHT BEFORE, LOOK, IN THE
 FINAL FOUR GAME, THE KID STILL
 HAD TO MAKE FREE THROWS.THAT'S .
 IN THIS GAME, THEY HAD A W
 OVERTIME.
 T THAT POINT, YOU WANT
 ñ■ THAT ■@OUT.
 I GET IT.
 NOT EVERYBODY - HOW MANY
 HUMANS ARE OUT ON THAT FLOOR
 BETWEEN THE TWO TEAMS AND THE
 S AND THE ASSISTANT
 COACHES AND THE REFS.
 NOT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS GOING
 TO OPERATE LIKE A ROBOT AND HAVE
 A PERFECT MOMENT EVERY MOMENT
 THEY'RE OUT THERE.
 BUT THEY LOST THE
 ENTIRE BASKETBALL GAME.
 IF I'M A COACH, AND ERIC I
 THINK WOULD SAY THE SAME THING,
 IF HE WAS STILL ABLE TO GET THE
 BALL TO D. WADE, NO BIG DEAL.
 HE NEVER TOUCHED THE BALL.
 WE ALL KNOW THE PLAY WAS FOR D.
 WADE TO HAVE HIS HAN
 BALL TO BE A-ÑT■T■ToT■T■T
 ONE.
 HE NEVER GOT A  GET IT.
 IT'S FRUSTRATING, AND THE
 STAKES ARE HIGH.
 ALL RIGHT.
 COMING UP, WE'LL DISCUSS HOW
 LAST NIGHT THE ROCKETS BROKE
 THEIR OWN RECORD FOR MOST THREES
 IN A SINGLE GAME WITH 27 AGAINST
 THE SUNS.
 SHOOTING RECORDS FOOL'S■>■>COME?
 WE'LL DISCUSS THAT.

THAT'S TERRIBévév
 COME ON.
 UGLY.
 LET'S STAY IN HOUSTON WHERE THE
 ROCKETS BROKE THEIR OWN RECORD
 FOR MOST THREES IN A SINGLE
 GAME.
 THEY WENT 27 FOR 57 BEHIND THE
 ARC.
 THIS IS LAST NIGHT OVER THE
 SUNS.
 ERIC GORDON LEADING THE WAY.
 HARDEN HAD FIVE.
 THIS SEASON, THE HOUSTON ROCKETS
 HAVE HIT 1,305 THREES, ALSO AN
 NBA REPORT.
 SO LOOK, IT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,
 BYRON.
 IT'S THE REGULAR SEASON.
 THEIR NAME IS VERY PRETTY IN THE
 TOP THREE SPOTS THERE.
 IS THIS FOOL'S GOLD COME PLAYOFF
 TIME FOR HOUSTON?
 WE ALL REMEMBER GAME SEVEN OF
 THE WESTERN CONFERENCE■/ FINALS.
 THE SHOT SHEET THAT WOULDN'T
 DIE,GHT?
 IT WAS LIKE 27 IN A ROW.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS ■ THEIR
 STYLE.
 THIS IS HOW THEY BEEN PLAYING
 FOR THE LAST FOUR OR FIo/
 WE'VE ALL SAID THATç■RE GOING
 TO LIVE BY THE THREE, DIE BY THE
 THREE.
 I REMEMBER FIVE TO TEN YEARS AGO
 YOU SAID YOU WOULD NEVER WIN
 WITH THIS BRAND OF BASKETBALL IT
 IT WAS ALWAYS FROM THE
 INSIDE-OUT, THREE-POINT SHOOTING
 WHERE YOU'RE AVERAGING, YOU
 KNOW, 30, 40 THREE-POINTERS A
 GAME.
 YOU'LL NEVER WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP.
 THEN GOLDEN STATE DISMISSED
 THAT.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, WE SHOULD PUT
 A CLOCK ON THIS.
 HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET ALL THE
 Xs TO FILL IN.
 AFTER ABOUT TEN STRAIGHT,
 SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DRIVE TO THE
 BASKET.
 AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE.
 AGAI ■2ÑáÑáóá■LE.
 THIS IS THE WAY THEY
 THIS IS]HE]]]■]42]]■
 CONTINUE TO PLAY.
 I MEAN, I DON'T THINK IT'S
 FOOL'S GOLD.
 I THINK IT'S GOLD.
 DID YOU NOTICE SOMETHING ABOUT
 ALL THOSE TEAMS ON THAT LIST?
 THEY'RE ALL REALLY GOOD.
 THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS HAVE
 WON, WHAT, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS
 IN FOUR YEARS.
 CLEVELAND WAS SHOOTING THE BALL
 EXTREMELY WELL THAT SEASON.
 I THINK THIS IS JUST THE NEW
 REALITY.
 FOR DECADES, TEAMS WOULD GET
 COLD, RIGHT.
 NOBODY EVER SAID LIVE BYTH
 TWO, DIE BY T
 BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE
 SHOOTING.
 IF YOU'RE TAKING A CONTESTEDç■■
 E-POINTER AND■ ■  CSOMEONE IEN B
 SHOT, BY ALL MEANS.
O■ó ■  IF TREVOR IRIZA IS TAK
 SHOT FOR THE ROCKETS, SOMETHING
 HAS GONE WRONG.
 I JUST THINK THAT -I THINK
 IT'S JUST YOU MEASURE A SHOT IN
 A LARGER CONTEXT.
 RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE
 IN THREE-POINT ATTEMPTS, I THINK
 ONLY TWO OR THREE ARE GOING TO
 THE PLAYOFFS.
 LOOK AT THE TOP TEN TEAM■■■■■■■
 THINK EIGHT OR NINE OF THEM ARE
 GOIN

 WAY, MAN.
 IT'S FUN, IT'S GREAT.
 IT'S A FUN THING TO BE GOING
 INTO THE PLAYOFFS FEELING HOT.
 IT'S JUST HARD TO SAY AFTER
 WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS AT THE
 MOST CRITICAL JUNCTURE THAT
 THEY'VE HAD IN QUITE SOME TIME,
 THEIR CHANCE TO GO TO THE NBA
 FINALS.
 THEY COULDN'T GET THAT THING
 DONE.
 SO THEREFORE, YOU HAVE TO
 WONDER, OKAY, WHAT DOES IT MEAN
 THEY'RE SETTING THESE RECORDS?
 YOU WANT IT TO MEAN SOMETHING
 LATER ALSO.
 SURE.
 MAYBE I THINK THE WARRIORS ARE A
 TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THIS
 BATTLE HAS BEEN WON.
 NG DOWN, EVEN IF YOU LOSE o@
 FOUR OR FIVE IN A ROW.
 HAVE YOU BEEN TO LAS VEGAS

 WITH A WIN OVER THE HAWKS LAST

 TEAM TO REACH 60 WINS THIS
 SEASON.
 MILWAUKEE HASN'T WON 60 GAMES
 SINCE THE '80, '81 SEASON.
 BYRON, IS THIS SOMETHING,
 NOTHING, OR EVERYTHING?
 THIS IS EVERYTHING.
 EVERYTHING.
 FOR THIS TEAM TO BE ABLE TO
 ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND HAVE THE
 BEST RECORD IN T NBA, WHICH
 MEANS RIGHT NOW THEY ARE THE
 BEST TEAM IN THE NBA, YOU GOT TO
 GIVE THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS AND

 GOAL.

 STRATOSPHERE LEVEL.
 I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY THE

 THE WARRIORS ARE THE BEST TEAM
 IN THE NBA.
 I'M SAYING BY THEIR RECORD,
 60 WINS, THEY'RE THE BEST TEAM.
 YOU THINK IF THE WARRIORS
 WEREN'T IN THE EAST, THEY
 WOULDN'T HIT 60?
 BUT THEY'RE NOT IN THE EAST.
 THEY'RE THE BE GOING INTO
 THE PLAYOFFS IN THE NBA.
 THEY HAVE THE BEST BODY OF
 WORK.
 THEY HAVE THE BEST RECORD.
 THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
 THE BROOKLYN NETS AND ORLANDO
 MAGIC BOTH CLINCHED PLAYOFF

 SIGNIFICANT DROUGHTS.
 FOR THE NETS, THEIR FIRST
 APPEARANCE SINCE 2015, WHILE THE
 MAGIC HADN'T REACHED THE PLAYOFF

 THAT'S CORRECT.
 HAVE NOT REACHED THE PLAYOFFS
 SINCE THEN.
 WOW.
 VERY EMOTIONAL LAST NIGHT, BY
 THE WAY.
 THE ENTIRE LOCKER ROOM.
 WHO DO YOU THINK IS MORE
 DANGEROUS COME PLAYOFF TIME, THE
 NETS OR THE MAGIC?
 I GIVE AN EDGE TO THE NETS,
 AND THIS IS WHY.
 THEY HAVE SO MUCH■@

 YOU'VE GOT USSELL.
 LeVERT IS GNG HEALTHIER.
 JOE HARRIS JUST DRAINS SHOTS,
 AND THEY KNOW HOW TO FIND GOOD
 LOOKS.
 I THINK PERIMETER PTH, THEY
 REALLY HUSTLE DEFENSIVELY AS
 WELL.
 YEAH, I AGREE WITH KEVIN

 I THINK THEY'RE A LOT MORE
 DANGEROUS THAN THE ORLANDO MAGIC
 JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID.
 THEIR PERIMETER OFFENSE AND
 DEFENSE HAS BEEN GREAT ALL
 SEASON LONG.
 THEY GOT AN ALL-STAR IN DeANGELO
 RUSSELL.
 YOU GOT JOE HARRIS WHO CAN KNOCK
 DOWN THREES FROM EVERYWHERE.
 AND THEY PROTECT THE RIM ON THE
 DEFENSIVE END AS WELL AS ANYBODY
 IN THE LEAGUE.
 AND THE FACT THEY JUST SEEM TO
 ENJOY PLAYING WITH ONE ANOTHER.
 THEY SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN.
 I REALLY THINK THAT THEY HAVE --
 I MEAN, THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE
 SIX SEED AS OF RIGHT NOW.
 THEY'LL HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL
 WITH PHILLY.
 IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING
 SERIES.
 I WANT TO GIVE A QUICK
 SHOUTOUT TO THE MAGIC.
 I THINK THEY'VE JUST DONE
 SOMETHING REA■ THIS YEAR.
 OUB
 THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID FOR
 IN THIS LEAGUE WE'RE GOING TO
 PLAY A VERY CONVENTIONAL BUT
 COMPETENT BRAND OF DEFENSE.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO TURN THE BALL

 WE'RE GOING TO OWN THE DEFENSIVE GLASS.
 IF YOU CAN DO IN EASTERN
 CONFERENCE, YOU CAN GET TO THE
 PLAY THEY HAVE.
 LET'HE GAMES WE'RE
 SUPPOSED TO WIN, RIGHT?
 THERE YOU GO.
 IT'S SHOCKING HOW FAR AHEAD
 THAT PUTS YOU.
 I DO WANT TO CONGRATULATE BOTH
 OF THOSBASES TOO.
 THAT'S A LONG TIME TO SUFFER AN
 YEARS, BUT IT WAS A HARD-FOUGHT
 FEW YEARS.
 GOOD FOR THEM ALL THE WAY
 AROUND.
 I WANT TO ADDRESS THE PIECE
 THAT KYLE KORVER WROTE FOR THE
 PLAYERS TRIBUNE.
 HE SHARES HIS OWN FEELS ON THE
 INCIDENT WITH THE NYPD.
 HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HIS REACTION
 AT THE TIME IS NOT SOMETHING
 HE'S REALLY PROUD OF NOW.
 HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW ALL THIS
 WAS BROUGHT UP AFTER THE
 INCIDENT BETWEEN RUSSELL
 WESTBROOK AND THAT FAN IN UTAH
 ON MARCH 11th.
 IT'S ABOUT SO MUCH MORE THAN
 THAT THOUGH BECAUSE HE ADDRESSES
 THE ISSUE OF WHITE PRIVILEGE.
 IN THE PIECE, KORVER ASKS THE
 FOLLOWING QUESTIONS.
 QUOTE, HOW CAN I, AS A WHITE
 MAN, PART OF THIS SYSTEMIC
 PROBLEM, BECOME PART OF THE
 SOLUTION WHEN IT COMES TO RACISM
 IN MY WORKPLACE, IN MY
 COMMUNITY, IN THIS COUNTRY?
 AS FOR THE WESTBROOK SITUATION,
 KORVER WRITES, QUOTE, THIS
 WASN'T ONLY ABOUT RUSS AND SOME
 HECKLER.
 IT WAS ABOUT MORE THAN THAT.
 IT WAS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO
 JUST EXIST RIGHT NOW AS A PERSON
 OF COLOR IN A MOSTLY WHITE
 SPACE.
 IT WAS ABOUT RACISM IN AMERICA.
 KORVER ALSO NOTED THAT AS A
 WHITE MAN, I HAVE TO HOLD MY
 FELLOW WHITE MEN ACCOUNTABLE.
 WE ALL HAVE TO HOLD EACH OTHER
 ACCOUNTABLE.
 I WOULD URGE EVERYONE OUT THERE
 TO READ THE FULL PIECE.
 KYLE KORVER DIDN'T HAVE TO
 CO-WRITE THIS.
 HE WENT OUT AND DID IT AND PUT
 HIS NAME AND WANTED TO PUT THE
 CONVERSATION OUT THERE.
 NOT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
 FORCED TO HAVE IT EVERY DAY,
 WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT, BUT
 THE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE AREN'T
 HAVING IT QUITE ENOUGH, HIM
 TAKING THAT TIME TO REFLECT
 ABOUT HOW HE CAN BE MORE OF AN
 AGENT FOR CHANGE.
 BYRON, WHAT DID YOU THINK UPON
 READING AND HEARING ABOUT THIS?
 FIRST TIME I HEARD IT, I SAID
 PREACH.
 KYLE, PREACH TO THE PEOPLE.
 WE DO TRY TO SWEEP THIS UNDER
 THE RUG.
 IT'S SO DIFFERENT WHEN A BLACK
 GUY SAYS OR A PERSON OF COLOR
 SAYS THERE'S SO MUCH RACISM IN
 THE WORLD.
 I GOT PASSED OVER BECAUSE OF THE
 COLOR OF MY SKIN FOR A
 PROMOTION.
 I DIDN'T GET THIS PARTICULAR JOB
 BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF MY SKIN.
 SO I THOUGHT WHAT HE SAID WAS
 RIVETING.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS MIND BLOWING AT
 CERTAIN TIMES.
 I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS VERY
 EDUCATIONAL.
 NOW YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR OWN,
 AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
 PEOPLE, THE CAUCASIAN PEOPLE IN
 SOCIETY, YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR
 OWN STANDING UP AND TELLING YOU
 THAT IN THE WORKPLACE HE SEES
 THIS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS AND
 HE WANTS TO BE ONE OF THE GUYS
 OUT FRONT RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S
 NOT FAIR ON ALL LEVELS AND THAT
 PEOPLE OF COLOR DO GET TREATED
 DIFFERENTLY.
 HE DOES FEEL PRIVILEGED AT
 TIMES.
 I THINK IT WAS GREAT THAT HE
 JUST BROUGHT THIS TO OUR
 ATTENTION.
 AGAIN, I WANT TO APPLAUD HIM
 BECAUSE IF YOU READ THE PIECE,
 IT IS REALLY RIVETING.
 THERE WAS A REALLY
 INTERESTING PORTION AT THE
 BOTTOM OF THE PIECE WHERE HE
 SAYS, LOOK, IN A LEAGUE THAT'S
 75% PEOPLE OF COLOR, I AM A VERY
 RECOGNIZABLE WHITE NAME.
 SO IT PRESENTS VERY INTERESTING
 UNDERTONES.
 ■vv■ ■88■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■1■■1■1
 REASONS, POSSIBLY FOR THE WRONG
 REASONS.
 JUST KNOW IF YOU DO BUY M(■&0s■Q
 JERSEY, IF I'M A SYMBOL, KNOW
 THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE.
 I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN
 INTERESTING COMMENTARY.
 AND LOOK, PART OF IT IS
 UNDERSTANDING, OH, AS YOU SAY,
 BYRON, THIS PERSON MIGHT BE
 DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF
 WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, BUT ALSO
 UNDERSTANDING IF YOU ARE SOMEONE
 WHO'S BEEN GIVEN ALL THE
 AUTOMATIC ADVANTAGES AT BIRTH
 THAT YOU GET FROM BEING WHITE IN
 THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AT THIS
 TIME, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW
 FAR THAT PUTS YOU AHEAD OF OTHER
 PEOPLE BEFORE ANYONE DOES
 ANYTHING.
 ANYTHING YOU EARNED OR DIDN'T
 EARN, THAT YOU ARE STARTING FROM
 SO FAR AHEAD.
 HAVING KYLE COME OUT AND SAY
 THAT, AS YOU SAY, SOMEONE THAT
 MAY BE, AS PUT IT IN THE
 PIECE -HE GOES, WHEN I LOOK
 AROUND AN NBA GAME, I LOOK MORE
 LIKE A LOT OF THE FANS THAN I DO
 LIKE THE PLAYERS.
 AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I
 SEE THIS.
 I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SAW THE
 TWEETS FROM SOME OF THE OTHER
 PLAYERS.
 I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WAS
 SO MOVING TOO.
 IT'S THEM SAYING, OH, YOU
 RECOGNIZE THIS.
 YOU SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, I'VE BEEN A
 BIG KYLE KORVER FAN FOR A LONG
 TIME.
 OBVIOUSLY IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
 WITH THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN.
 IT'S THE WAY HE PLAYS THE GAME,
 THE WAY HE'S ABLE TO COME OFF
 SCREENS AND SHOOT THE BALL.
 HE'S WORKED HIS WAY UP INTO A
 12, 13, 14-YEAR NBA CAREER
 BECAUSE OF HIS WORK ETHIC AND
 THE WAY HE GOES OUT AND DOES HIS
 BUSINESS EVERY DAY, EVERY SINGLE
 DAY.
 I'M A MUCH BIGGER FAN OF KYLE
 KORVER OF WHAT I READ
 TODAY.
 AND HE DID TALK ABOUT THAT
 INCIDENT WITH THE NEW YORK
 POLICE OUTSIDE OF THAT
 NIGHTCLUB.
 HE SAYS, HE WAS MY TEAMMATE, WE
 WERE CLOSE.
 HE WASN'T JUST SOMEONE ON MY
 TEAM.
 WE WERE FRIENDS.
 HE SAID, MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN I
 SAW THE NEWS REPORT THE NEXT DAY
 IS, WHAT'S HE DOING OUT AT THAT
 CLUB?
 IT WASN'T, OH, WAIT, HE GOT
 ATTACKED BY THE POLICE.
 IF YOU REMEMBER, HE WAS INJURED
 IN THAT EXCHANGE.
 IT COST HIM THE REST OF HIS
 SEASON.
 LATER HE WON A CIVIL CASE
 AGAINST THE NEW YORK POLICE.
 IT WAS FALSE ARREST.
 THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO
 PUT THEIR HANDS ON HIM THE WAY
 THEY DID.
 AND KYLE SAID THAT NOW THINKING
 ABOUT IT, HE WOULD SAY, OH, IF
 IT WAS ME, I NEVER WOULD HAVE
 BEEN ARRESTED.
 HE WAS WALKING OUT OF A CLUB AS
 WHITE DUDE KYLE KORVER THAT TIME
 OF NIGHT, HE BELIEVES EVEN IF HE
 HAD GOTTEN INTO SOME SORT OF
 EXCHANGE, HE WOULD NOT HAVE GOT
 INTO THAT KIND OF PHYSICAL
 ALTERCATION AND BEEN ARRESTED BY
 THE POLICE.
 REALIZING THAT, HE SAID, WAS
 PART OF WHAT REALLY SORT OF
 MOVED HIM, ESPECIALLY AS THIS
 INCIDENT IN UTAH HAPPENED.
 I COVERED THAT HAWKS TEAM.
 IT WAS VERY INTERESTING,
 TIME, THE KIND ONVEONS GO■ ■ E
 ORGANIZATION.
 IT WAS A REALLY CRYSTALLIZING
 POINT NOT ONLY FOR THAT
 FRANCHISE, WHICH ENDURED ALL
 KINDS OF INDIGNITIES, COMMENTS
 MADE BY PREVIOUS OWNER BRUCE
 LEVINSON, BUT ALSO THE
 CONVERSATION PROPELLED AT THAT
 MOMENT INSIDE THE ORGANN.
 IT WAS INTERESTING.
 GO READ THE PIECE.
 EXCELLENT WORK BY "THE PLAYERS'
 TRIBUNE" AND KYLE KORVER.
 HERE'S WHAT "THE JUMP"
 RECOMMENDS TODAY.
 ON THE ESPN APP, THE EIGHTH
 ANNUAL LUKE WALTON ALL-STARS
 COLUMN.
 SO GOOD EVERY YEAR.
 GUYS WHO FLOURISH IN NEW ROLES
 AFTER BOUNCING AROUND A BIT.
 ONE OF THE PICKS IS JOAKIM NOAH
 WHO SAYS I'M MORE PROUD OF THIS
 YEAR THAN WHEN I WAS AN
 ALL-STAR.
 PRETTY COOL.

          Choose Mobil 1        Synthetic instead.
    It protects engines better   than conventional motor oil.
        You know, you look        much taller on TV.
    The camera adds six feet.
        Get 250,000 miles          of protection.
       Upgrade to Mobil 1.

   I know what you're thinking.
   Electric, it's not for you.
   And, you're probably right.
      Electric just doesn't      have enough range.
       It will neverive the wint.
        Charging stations?
 Good luck finding one of those.
    So, maybe an electric car    isn't for you after all.
            Or, is it?

 IT'S GOING TO HANG HERE
 THROUGHOUT THE PLAYOFF RUN THEN
 GO TO THE NEW BUILDING AT CHASE
 CENTER TO HONOR THE 47 SEASONS
 WE SAW WARRIOR BASKETBALL IN THE
 OLDEST AND ONE OF THE GREATEST
 NBA ARENAS WE'VE HAD THE
 PRIVILEGE TO WATCH GAMES IN.
 KLAY THOMPSON POSTING THIS ON
 INSTAGRAM AFTER THAT GREAT
 MOMENT.
 SITTING UP HERE SOAKING IT ALL
 IN.
 I'M GOING TO MISS ORACLE, BUT
 WHAT I'LL MISS -LOOK AT KLAY.
 HE'S THAT LITTLE DOT UP THERE.
 WHAT I'M GOING TO MISS MOST IS
 THAT OAKLAND LOVE BECAUSE
 THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.
 NICE MOMENTOR KLAY AFTER■h■8
 HAVING A LITTLE MISSTEP WITH THR
 MON
 IS WAS A NICE GIVE BACK THERE.
 BYRON, HOW WILL YOU REMEMBER
 ORACLE?
 I'M GOING TO REMEMBER IT IN
 THREE PHASES.
 I■■■@ME.
 THE FIRST ONE IS AS A PLAYER.
 WE PLAYED AGAINST THE GOLDEN
 STATE WARRIORS WHEN THEY WERE
 KNOWN AS RUN EY CAME INTO L.A.,
 THEM IN A SERIES AND BEAT US IN
 GAME TWO TO MAKE THE SERIES TIED
 UP AT ONE API
 THEN WE GO TO ORACLE, AND THEY
 HAD THE ORIGINAL RUN DMC OUT
 THERE PERFORMI INTRODUCINEM, WH
 OFF.
 WE END UP WINNING THE NEXT THREE
 GAMES TO CLOSE THAT SERIES OUT.
 WHY DID THAT UPSET YOU SO
 MUCH?
 YOU DON'T PARTY ON US, BACK
 IN THE DAY.
 YOU COULD NOT COME OUT AND PARTY
 ON US LIKE THAT BACK IN THE DAY.
 GOLDEN STATEME AGAINST THE  THAT
 CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WHERE LeBRON
 IN EVER■■z THAT COU■÷C=C=OSSIBL.
 TCK HE HIT, THENKYRIE ONE
 ON ONE WITH STEPH TO HIT THE
 GAME WINNER.
 ONE OF THE CLASSIC GAME SEVENS
 THAT I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.
 IT HAPPENED IN ORACLE.
 THEN THE THIRD THING IS JUST THE
 ORACLE FANS.
 T TEN YEARS, THEY'VE
 BEEN SOME OF THE BEST FANS IN
 NBA.
 THEY'VE BEEN GREAT, VERY
 SUPPORTIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE, VERY
 KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE GAME OF
 BASKETBALL.
 THOSE THREE THINGS ARE MY TAKE
 FROM ORACLE ARENA.
 I W■■SS SEEING THOSE GAMES
 PLAYED UP THERE.
 I'M GOING TO REALLY MISS THE
 NBA BEING IN THE EAST BAY.
 I'M GOING TO MISS WARRIORS FANS
 WHO I'VE ALWAYS$LOVED.
 THE BUILDING A
 @■[ TO CONCRETE AND NOISE
  NARROW■>IDORS AND
 ITS HANDSY SECURITY.
 CAN WE STOPOMANTICIZING THIS
 STRUCTURE?
 I MEAN, ILOVE  I TRULY AM
 ñg T■BAY.
 I LOVE THESE FANS.
 IT IS A TERRIBLE BUILDING AND
 SHOULD BE IMPLODED AS SOON AS
 POSSIBLE.
 AND THAT EXPANSIVE AWFUL TAR
 PARKING LOT, YOU NEED A TETANUS
 SHOT TO GO OUT THERE.
 IT IS AWFUL.
 HANDSY SECURITY?
 THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER SHOW TOO.
 HANDSY SECURITY, I LIKET.
 BUT I'M GOING TO MISS
 OAKLAND.
 TO ME, I THINK THE FACT THEY
 CAME OUT FOR LAST NIGHT'S GAME
 IN THE UNIS, THOSE ARE THE
 THROWBACKS TO THE WE BELIEVE
 WARRIORS TEAM.
 FUNNY BECAUSE AT THE TIME THOSE
 WERE NOT VERY POPULAR UNIFORMS
 WITH THE FANS.
 BUT OF COURSE THEY'VE COME TO
 SYMBOLIZE THIS MOMENT.
 I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT OF
 ALL THE DIFFERENT ERAS OF ORACLE
 WARRIORS BASKETBALL THEY COULD
 HAVE PICKED, THEY PICK THAT.
 TO ME, THE FACT THAT'S STILL THE
 MOST SORT OF DEEPLY FELT
 EMOTIONAL MOMENT FOR THE FAN
 BASE, EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE WON
 THREE TITLES --
 THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.
 IT SPEAKS TO WHAT THE FANS OF
 ORACLE ABOUT.
 THERE ARE SOME GOLDEN STATE FANS
 THAT GET CRITICIZED FOR BEING
 FRONT RUNNERS OR BANDWAGON
 JUMPERS, OR, OH, YOU JUST WOKE
 UP AND STARTED TO LIKE THIS TEAM
 BECAUSE THEY WON TITLES.
 THE TEAM THEY CAME OUT AND CHOSE
 TO REPRESENT LAST NIGHT FOR
 THEIR LAST GAME IN ORACLE WASN'T
 A BANDWAGON JUMPING KIND OF
 TEAM.
 IT WAS THE TEAM THAT DID THAT.
 IT WAS■í■í■í■í■í■í■í■í■í■í ALL
 THEyND GRITTINESS AND
 REPED SORT OF THE UNDER
 NATURE OF OAKLAND TO BEGIN WITH.
 I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY FITTING
 THAT THEY PICKED THAT TEAM TO
 SORT OF BE LIKE, THIS IS OUR
 FINAL STAND.
 THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MAYBE
 EMPHASIZE, OH, ?E■■■■E■■■■E■■■Eç
 THEY WERE LIKE, THAT'S WIS
  ALWAYSNG TO BE
>'S■■■■■■■■■■■■T RY COO■E>■
 RI■ESON.
 ■■■■?■■■■■■ THAT CAVS' EPIC
 3-1 CO■ I016 FINALS.
 DID YOU KNOW THE WARRIORS  A
 3-1 LEAD?
 DID TER COME UP?
 YESTERDAY WHILE CALLING THE
 CAVS' FIRST GAME, HE CRITICIZED
 THE WARRIORS FOR PICKING UP K.D2
 AFTER THAES.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 THEY'VE LITERALLY -YOU
 UNDERSTAND.
 YOU GOT TO DO THAT TEN TIMES OUT
 OF TEN.
 BUT YOU■ KNOW, WHERE I COME FRO
 IN THE PARK AND IN THE STREET,
 IF YOU'RE PLAYING AND LOSE
 SOMEBODY, THE FIRST WORDS ARE
 RUN IT BACK, SAME TEAM.

 KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 RUN IT BACK.
 RUN IT BACK.
 THAT'S HOW WE GREW UP, RIGHT?
 GETTING EXCITED OVER HERE.
 RUN IT BACK, SAME TEAM.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE
 ANYTHING.
 WE FELT LIKE WE'RE THE BETTER
 TEAM.
 WE JUST DIDN'T PLAY WELL ENOUGH,
 SO LET'S RUN IT BACK.
 THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.
 THEY WERE LIKE, WE NEED TO
 RELOAD, GET OUR BIG BROTHER.
 THANKS, GUYS.
 K.D. LEFT A COMMENT ON AN
 INSTAGRAM POST THAT HAD THAT
 CLIP SAYING, QUOTE, EVERYBODY
 WANT TO BE FROM THE STREETS
 NOWADAYS.
 JEFFERSON RESPONDED WITH A LONG
 COMMENT THAT READ IN PART, MY
 SINGLE MOM LEFT L.A. TRYING TO
 MAKE SURE ONE OF HER THREE BOYS
 DIDN'T GET SHOT UP ON THE SAME
 CORNER MY DAD DID THIS YEAR.
 THAT JUST HAPPENED EARLIER THIS
 YEAR.
 OUR CONDOLENCES TO RICHARD'S
 FAMILY.
 I THINK WE CAN BOTH RELATE TO
 SINGLE MOMS WITH THAT STRUGGLE.
 WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THIS
 EXCHANGE, KEVIN?
 THAT PERCEPTIONS OF CLASS AND
 AUTHENTICITY STILL HAVE REAL
 CURRENCY AMONG PLAYERS IN THE
 LEAGUE.
 TO CLAIM STREET, TO MANY
 PLAYERS, YOU NEED TO SHOW
 STREET.
 ALSO WHAT MY RESPONSE IS, DURANT
 IS STILL IN THE BUSINESS OF
 AND APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT GOING
 TO CHANGE, EVEN ON TVE OF
 THE PLAYOFFS.
 HEY, THAT'S HIS WAY.
 BYRON, YOU'RE FROM INGLEWOOD.
 IF YOU WANT TO START PLAYING THE
 STREET CREDIBILITY GAME, WHAT
 DID YOU MAKE OF THIS?
 I DON'T HAVE TO CLAIM THE
 STREETS.
 EVERYBODY KNOW WHERE I'M FROM.
 SO WHERE CLAIM IT?
 I DON'T HAVE TO CLAIM IT.
 I'M WITH KEVIN.
 IF I'M KEVIN DURANT, I WOULDN'T
 HAVE EVEN COMMENTED ON IT, TO BE
 HONEST WITH YOU.
 HE'S A GROWN MAN.
 HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY.
 THAT'S WHY THEY CALL FREE AGENCY
 FREE AGENTS.
 YOU GET A CHANCE TO DO WHAT YOU
 WANT TO DO.
 HE HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO A
 DIFFERENT TEAM WHO HAD JUST BEAT
 HIM IN THE PLAYOFFS BUT ALSO
 MAKE THEM STRONGER BECAUSE THEY
 JUST WON A CHAMPIONSHIP AND GO
 AHEAD AND CHASE A RING.
 THAT'S HIS PREROGATIVE.
 I'M NOT THROWING SHADE AT KEVIN
 OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAS A CHANCE
 TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON WHAT
 THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR
 LIVES.
 THAT'S YOUR JOB.
 THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.
 I APPLAUD HIM FOR DOING THAT.
 BUT I UNDERSTAND WHERE RICHARD
 IS COMING FROM.
 BACK IN THE DAY, HE'S RIGHT.
 HE'S RIGHT.
 BACK IN THE DAY WHEN WE ALL WERE
 GROWING UP, YOU RUN IT BACK.
 LET'S PLAY AGAIN.
 BY THE WAY, HIS COMMENT
 WASN'T EVEN REALLY DIRECTED AT
 KEVIN DURANT.
 HIS COMMENT WAS, HEY, WE HAD
 THIS CRAZY COMEBACK, AND
 WARRIORS FANS AND IN SOME WAYS
 SOME OF THE WARRIORS PLAYERS
 WITH THEIR COMMENTS OVER THE
 NEXT FEW MONTHS MADE SORT OF THE
 DISTINCTION THAT THEY GOT LUCKY
 OR IT WAS DRAYMOND GREEN'S
 SUSPENSION OR■■EY OR
 ANY OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED
 HIS POINT WAS, HEY, IF YOU
 REALLY THINK THAT THIS WAS SOME
 BIG FLUKE, WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
 JUST RUN IT BACK WITH THE SAME
 TEAM AND SHOW SOME LOYALTY TO
 YOUR GUY THAT YOU D AND ■■oAL■ ?
 NOW, HE DID ALSO SAY IN THOSE
 COMMENTS, TEN OUT OF TEN.
 EXA
 > BUT IT WAS NOT A SHOT AT K.D.
 ANYWAY.
 IF IT WANG A  IT WAS
 AT THE WARRIORS.
 THE ORGANIZATION, RIGHT.
 COME UP, WE'LL ABOUT A

 THEY VOTED RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND
 DRAYMOND GREEN AS THE MOST o■

          Anthony Davis?
          Choose Mobil 1        Synthetic instead.
    It protects engines better   than conventional motor oil.

 ALT
 ATHLETIC.
 122 PLAYERS WERE POLL■ú■ú■úzúTH
 NAMES, BUT THEY DO HAVE TO GIVE
 THEIR OPINIONS.
 44.3% VOTED JAMES HARDEN AS
 THEIR MVP THIS SEASON.THAT'S COV
 FOR GIANNIS, 13% VOTING FOR
 PG-13.
 BYRON, DID YOU EXPECT MORE
 PLAY VOTE FOR HARDEN?
 EVERY SINGLE FORMER PLAYER WHO
 HAS COME THROUGH THE SHOW SAID
 I'M LEANING TOWARD GIANNIS.
 CURRENT PLAYERS LEANING TOWARD
 HARDEN.
 I EXPECTED IT TO BE CLOSE.
 I E■■■WIN IT.
 WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO THIS
 SEASON WAS REMARKABLE.
 SOME OF THE RECORDS HE WAS ABLE
 TO SET, SOME OF THE RECORDS HE
 WAS ABLE TO CHASE WERE
 RE.
 I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE A
 RUNAWAY.
 GIANNIS HAS BEEN FANTASTIC ALL
 SEASON LONG.
 DWISE, BEST TEAM IN THE
 LEAGUE.
 I KNEW IT WOULD BE CLOSE, BUT I
 GAVE THE EDGE TO JAMES HARDEN.
 HARDEN WON THE PLAYERS' POLL
 OVER STEPH IN ST FIRST MVP
 YEAR.
 THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HARDEN'S
 GAME, THE WAY HE IS ON THE FLOOR
 THAT PLAYERS LOVE.
 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
 IF T GOES FOR THE VOTE FOR
  MVP.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT RUSS AND
 DRAYMOND.
 THEY WERE VOTED MOST OVERRATED
 IN THE SAME POLL.
 WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?
 SO THIS I FOUND INTERESTING
 FOR TWO REASONS.
 FIRST, THEY ARE STATISTICALLY IN
 TERMS OF PROFILE
 DIFFERENT.
 RUSS IS THE STAT STUFFER.
 THEY HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON,
 THEY'RE VERY ABRASIVE.
 GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUMMIT
 AN ABRASIVE PERSON, YOU CALL
 OVERRATED.IWHEN I SAW THIS,
 RUSS' NAME, I SAID WHAT?
 OVERRATED?
 A MAN THAT HAD  STR■4q■>9■9■
 SEASONS OF ■>E■E■E■TRIPLE-DOUBL
 HAD ONLY BEEN DONE ONCE, BYspsp.
 THIS IS ALL ABOUT HATE.
 THIS IS ALL ABOUT -YOU GOT A
 BUNCH OF GUYS THAT JUST HATING
 ON RUSSELL WESTBROOK'S GAME
 BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL
 THIS GUY IS OVERRATED.
 MATTER OF FACT, HE'S UNDERRATED.
 UNDERRATED.
 I MEAN, LOOK, THIS IS WHY,
 KEVIN, THE PLAYERS DON'T
 ACTUALLY VOTE FOR THESE AWARDS
 AT THE END OF THE SEASON.
 BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE PERSONAL
 BIASES REALLY COMING INTO PLAY,
 GUYS WHO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO
 VOTE FOR THEIR TEAMMATES, GUYS
 WHO VOTE AGAINST GUYS THEY'VE
 HAD A DUST-UP OR GRUDGES
 AGAINST.
 WHEN WE SEE PLAYERS -WHEN THEY
 DO GET TO VOTE FOR THINGS LIKE
 THE ALL-STAR GAME OR PLAYER
 AWARDS, SOME OF THE VOTES ARE SO
 OUT THERE.
 THEY VOTE IN FELLOW PLAY WHO
 BARELY PLAYED IN ANY GAMES.
 IT GETS KIND OF CRAZY.
 IT'S FUN TO SEE.
 IF THEY COULD EVER INSTITUTE
 A SITUATION WHERE MAYBE THE
 PLAYERS CAN VOTE BUT THEY SHOULD
 BE TRANSPARENT.
 I LIKE THAT.
 PLAYERS WOULD HAVE TO SAY WHO
 THEY VOTED ■
 I  THEN PLAYER VOTING WOULD
 BE EVEN MORE o)■TER FROM
 T -IF P■E HTO NOT
 ONLY VOTE BUT SHOW WHO
 VOTEDFOR 4 NAME, DON'T YOU
 THINK THAT PERSONAL FEELINGS,
 GRUDGES, AND FRIENDSULD
 COME IN SO MUCH MORE THAN
 OBJECTIVELY WHO'S THE BEST
 ABSOLUTELY.
 IF YOU WERE GIVEN A VOTE, YOU
 WOULD JUST VOTE YOUR ENTIRE
 LAKER TEAM.
 YEAH, BUT I WOULD ALSO VOTE
 IN MICHAEL JORDAN, OF COURSE AND
 A BUNCH OF OTHER GUY
