With moderate to severe Crohn's disease, I was there, just not always where I needed to be. Is she alright? I hope so. So I talked to my doctor about HUMIRA. I learned HUMIRA is for people who still have symptoms of Crohn's disease after trying other medications. And the majority of people on HUMIRA saw significant symptom relief and many achieved remission in as little as 4 weeks. <i> HUMIRA can lower your ability</i> <i> to fight infections,</i> <i> including tuberculosis.</i> <i> Serious, sometimes fatal</i> <i> infections and cancers,</i> <i> including lymphoma, have</i> <i>happened; as have blood, liver,</i> <i> and nervous system problems,</i> <i> serious allergic reactions,</i> <i> and new or worsening</i> <i> heart failure.</i> <i> Before treatment,</i> <i> get tested for TB.</i> <i> Tell your doctor</i> <i> if you've been to areas</i> <i>where certain fungal infections</i> <i> are common,</i> <i> and if you've had TB,</i> <i> hepatitis B,</i> <i>are prone to infections, or have</i> <i> flu-like symptoms or sores.</i> <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i> <i> if you have an infection.</i> Be there for you, and them. Ask your gastroenterologist about HUMIRA. With HUMIRA, remission is possible. Dad: Oh, hey guys! Mom (on speakerphone): Hi! Son (on speakerphone): Dad, I two goals today!
