HUMPHREYS IS ON MY ASS. ENGLISH DEPARTMENT HEAD OR NOT, I TOLD HIM TO GIVE ME A DAMN BREAK. I ONLY JUST HAD MY FACE RECONSTRUCTED. ... YOU LOOK GOOD, LAURIE. I CAN'T EVEN TELL. MY HUSBAND CAN. AND MY DAUGHTER. I FREAK HER OUT, SHE SAYS. WELL, EVERYTHING FREAKS HER OUT THAT ISN'T PAINTED WITH AT LEAST A GAZILLION OUNCES OF MASCARA, OR LITERS OR HOWEVER THE ... YOU MEASURE MASCARA. SHE'S ... OBSESSED WITH IT. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO TEENAGEHOOD? I REMEMBER DYEING MY HAIR ORANGE AND PIERCING MY NOSE TO RAGE AGAINST THE STATUS QUO, BUT THAT WAS A SORT OF CAUSE, YOU KNOW? NOWADAYS, IT'S JUST MASCARA AND FASHION AND NEXT TOP SUPERMODEL HOUSEWIVES OF BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING, YOU KNOW? ARE THEY GROWING DOWN? PROBABLY. AND THE SUBSTITUTE WAS AN IDIOT. I ASKED MY KIDS, WHAT'D YOU DO WHILE I WAS GONE? 3 WEEKS WHILE I WAS GONE. YOU KNOW, NOT ONE OF THEM COULD GIVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER. THEN ALEJANDRO FINALLY CRACKS. WATCHED THE WIRE. SEASON 4, HE TELLS ME. THE WIRE? YEAH. SAYS THE SUB WAS TRYING TO SHOW 'EM WHAT NOT TO DO. ARE YOU ... KIDDING ME? WHICH SUB WAS THIS? THAT CUTE YOUNG BLONDE STRAIGHT OUT OF TEACHER'S COLLEGE. PATRICIA OR PATRICE OR SOME ... . I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY TEACHING THEM OVER THERE? THE LAST SUB THEY SENT ME SHOWED 'EM DANGEROUS MINDS. DO THEY REALLY BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL IS MICHELLE PFEIFFER AND HILARY SWANK AND CORNY ... MUSIC AND CLOSE-UPS? I AM A WHITE CHICK WHO HAS NEVER HAD THE LUXURY OF WINNING OVER A CLASS FULL OF BLACK AND LATINO KIDS. THIS IS WAR. I GOT MY ... FACE CUT BY THE FAMILY OF A FAILING STUDENT. ... THEM AND THEIR LIES AND THESE SUBSTITUTES WHO SHOW THESE DUMBASS, GODFORSAKEN, SETTING US BACK 300 EDUCATIONAL YEARS, BULL-... FLICKS. TEACH, YOU ... I LEFT YOU LESSON PLANS, FOR ... SAKE. YEAH. THEY SHOULD'VE GOTTEN YOU SMITH. HUH? SHE'S A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER FROM THE GODS. THAT WEEK I WAS GONE WITH OMARI'S PNEUMONIA, I CAME BACK, MY KIDS HAD ALREADY MOVED ON TO THE NEXT CHAPTER OF INVISIBLE MAN. PAPERS WERE GRADED AND EVERYTHING. IT WAS IMPRESSIVE. AN ENIGMA IN THIS PLACE. YOU GONNA RETIRE OR WHAT? OH, ... THEM AND THEIR RETIREMENT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA FORCE MY HAND. TRY TO MOVE ME FROM 9th GRADE TO 10th GRADE TO 12th. I'LL OUTLAST 'EM ALL. BASTARDS. YOU'RE A PISTOL, WOMAN. I'M A GODDAMN MACHINE GUN. HOW'S YOUR SON? TROUBLE. NEXT QUESTION. YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT-
- HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT A THING. I'M SLIPPING OFF THE EDGE OF THE EARTH. THERE'S NO ANSWER IN THE DARK, DARK UNIVERSE. THE WORLD ISN'T FLAT, NYA. MINE IS, LAURIE. IT'S FLAT. IT'S COMING TO A QUICK AND FAST END, AND I CAN'T STOP IT. YES, YOU CAN. YOU JUST GOTTA GRAB IT BY THE BALLS AND TURN IT AROUND. THAT SON OF YOURS NEEDS A SWIFT KICK IN THE ASS. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE NEEDS, LAURIE. I REMEMBER WHEN PARENTS USED TO GIVE US PERMISSION TO SPANK THEIR KIDS IN CLASS. YOU OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THAT? WE TEACH TEENAGERS. ESPECIALLY THE TEENAGERS. YEAH, I DON'T THINK I REMEMBER THAT. THAT WAS THE BEST. I'M TELLING YOU. I HAD THIS ONE KID. LOUIE GASPACHO. I REMEMBER HIM REAL GOOD. YOU KNOW HOW SOME OF THEM STAY WITH YOU FOR A LIFETIME? WELL, HE HAD KIND OF A SCHIZOPHRENIA THING GOING ON. UNDIAGNOSED, BUT I KNEW. YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD LET US PRESCRIBE THE DRUGS INSTEAD OF THESE BOGUS DOCTORS. I KNOW THESE KIDS INSIDE AND OUT. I KNEW LOUIE. ANOTHER KID I THINK RITALIN RUINED. BUT HIS FOLKS LISTENED TO THAT SORRY EXCUSE OF A COUNSELOR-
- MS. ESSELMAN-
- OH! UHH! WHO WOULD RECOMMEND A DRUG TO JESUS IF SHE COULDN'T GET HIM TO SIT STILL FOR 5 MINUTES. NEVER FIGURED MAYBE IT WAS HER TACTICS AND NOT THE KID, BUT WHATEVER. HIS FOLKS WOULD NEVER GET HIM TESTED FOR HIS MENTAL HEALTH. COULDN'T AFFORD THE MEDICAL BILLS. HALF THESE DAMN KIDS ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM HERE. THE CLASSROOM CAN'T FIX THAT ... AND NEITHER CAN RITALIN. BUT WHAT DO THEY KNOW? NOTHING, THAT'S WHAT. I KNOW WHAT THESE KIDS NEED, BUT WHO LISTENS TO ME? ANYWAY, WHAT THE HELL WAS I TALKING ABOUT? LOUIE-
- LOUIE GASPACHO. EXACTLY. SO, HE COULD BE A REAL TERROR IF HE WAS HAVING A DAY. SO, ONE TIME HE THREW A BOOK AT ME. NEARLY KNOCKED OUT THE SMART LITTLE WEST INDIAN GIRL THAT SAT... I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD CALL HER THAT. I GRABBED HIS LITTLE SCRAWNY ASS IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS. [SLAPS TABLE] GAVE HIM 3 LICKS TO HIS BACKSIDE. NEVER A BOOK THROWN AGAIN. THAT KID GOT ALMOST STRAIGHT As THAT YEAR. BUT THEY DON'T GIVE ME MY CREDIT FOR THAT BECAUSE HE WAS INSTITUTIONALIZED A COUPLE YEARS LATER AND-
- PULLED OUT OF SCHOOL, SO IT WAS LIKE HE NEVER EXISTED, BUT I HAD HIM FUNCTIONING HIGH, YOU KNOW. A GOOD OLD ASS WHIPPING CAN TEACH A LOT. THAT'S NOT O's PROBLEM, LAURIE. OH, NO. I WASN'T SAYING THAT. IT'S TOO MANY THINGS. IT'S ME. I'M THE SOURCE, AND I KNOW IT. AND, LOOK, I CAN'T KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS IF I'M GONNA GET THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY, OK? I GOTTA DRIVE UPSTATE AFTER WORK, PICK HIM UP. I'LL FINISH STRESSING THEN. DON'T PANIC, HONEY. WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF SCREW-UPS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OUR MESS. YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT. SCREW-UPS? REALLY? IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. DON'T TAKE IT LITERAL-
- IT'S NOT LITERAL. RIGHT! OH! LADIES. WHAT IT DO? WHAT IT DO BACK TO YOU, YOU SEXY BASTARD. YOU TRYING TO GET ME IN TROUBLE ON SCHOOL GROUNDS AGAIN, LAURIE? JUST A LITTLE FLIRTATION BETWEEN A YOUNG, HOT SECURITY GUARD AND A VERY AGILE, OLD TEACHER. IT'S HARMLESS. FACE LOOKING GOOD, GIRL. MM. GOT YOU ALL BRAND-NEW. CAN'T KEEP A WHITE CHICK DOWN. GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK. AFTERNOON, NYA. OH, HEY, DUN. HOW YOU DOING TODAY? SURVIVING. LIKE EVERY DAY. HMM. GOOD FOR YOU. YEP! CAREFUL IN THE LOT TODAY AFTER WORK. THEY BEEN JACKING CARS AGAIN. THEY STILL HAVEN'T DETERRED THOSE BASTARDS? NOT YET. PRINCIPAL COLDEN SAYS WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING MORE SURVEILLANCE. WHAT THE HELL'S THE POINT OF THE SECURITY CAMERAS THEY PUT IN IF IT'S NOT GONNA SCARE OFF THESE HOODLUMS? I'M GONNA BE STATIONED OUT THERE FROM 12 TO 3 P.M. DON'T WORRY. I WON'T LET 'EM LAY A HAND ON YOUR BENZ, BABY. ... YOU, FUNNY MAN. MY ... OLDSMOBILE HASN'T FAILED ME YET. IT'S LIKE HAVING AN UGLY, FAITHFUL HUSBAND. NOBODY WANTS HIM BUT ME, AND THAT'S GOOD FOR US. AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR CAR, BABY. GOT CHARACTER JUST LIKE YOU. WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH SOCIALIZING FOR ME. I GOTTA GET MY CLASSROOM INTACT BEFORE THE NEXT SET OF HOOLIGANS COMES IN. HEY, YOU NEED ME TO COME UP THERE FOR ANY REASON, YOU KNOW HOW TO BUZZ ME. GOT YOU ON PRIORITY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. TAKE CARE OF THESE YOUNG GALS WHO DON'T KNOW ... ABOUT HOW TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. ME, I'M AN OLD DAME. A LITTLE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND I'M BACK IN THE GAME. GOT IT, MAMA. THIS IS MY DEN, YOU KNOW? THIS IS ALWAYS MY DEN. BEEN ALL RIGHT? YOU TALKING TO ME? NOBODY ELSE HERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. WHAT'S THAT? MAKE SMALL TALK. CHECK ON ME. PRETEND TO GIVE A DAMN. REALLY. I GOT A LOT ON MY MIND. LOTS TO THINK ABOUT. I DON'T NEED TO FILL THE SPACE. I'M COOL WITH EMPTINESS. GUESS YOU ARE. WHAT? NOTHIN'. YOU GOT A SMOKE? CAN'T DO THAT IN HERE. I'MMA TAKE IT OUTSIDE. DON'T WANNA HAVE TO BUST YOU. YOU BEING FUNNY? WILL IT MAKE YOU SMILE? I'M OUT OF SMILES FOR TODAY. THAT'S TOO BAD. WHAT'S LEFT FOR YOUR STUDENTS? GWENDOLYN BROOKS. THE POET. YOU KNOW HER? YOU THINK I SPEND ALL DAY GUARDING A SCHOOL AND SOME OF THE KNOWLEDGE DON'T RUB OFF ON ME? LOTS OF FOLKS SPEND ALL DAY IN SCHOOL AND DON'T LEARN DIDDLY. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE. TRUE DAT. BUT I'M NOT ONE OF THEM. WELL, THAT'S GOOD. SO, YOU ALL RIGHT? WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION? I WANT TO HEAR AN ANSWER THAT MAKES ME SATISFIED. YEAH, I'M NOT HERE TO SATISFY YOU. DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE. THEN LET IT GO. I NEVER HEAR FROM YOU ANYMORE. DON'T DO THIS HERE. THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING. OH, I DO SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE? YOU CAN JUST TELL ME. DON'T GOTTA DO THE COLD SHOULDER. THIS ISN'T A COLD SHOULDER. WHAT IS IT, THEN? IT'S SANITY. IT'S COMING TO ONE'S SENSES. PROFESSIONALISM. INTELLIGENCE. APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. YOU GONNA PLAY BY THE BOOKS ON ME? I'M NOT PLAYING BY THE BOOK. JESUS, I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT. DON'T DO ANYTHING. OK. LOOK, I GOT 10 MINUTES BEFORE MY NEXT CLASS. YOU SURE YOU DON'T HAVE A SMOKE? I REALLY NEED IT TODAY. I NEED IT TODAY. [TAPPING CARTON] [CHUCKLES] HA HA HA! [LAUGHS] THANKS. THAT'S SOMETHING WE DO WELL TOGETHER, AIN'T IT? WHAT'S THAT? VICES. I DON'T... I GUESS...MAYBE. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] CLASS. TODAY, WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT ONE OF MY FAVORITE POEMS BY GWENDOLYN BROOKS-
- WE REAL COOL. POOL PLAYERS-
- 7 AT THE GOLDEN SHOVEL. WE REAL COOL. NOW, I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS POEM IN BOTH VERSIONS THAT I'M SHARING WITH YOU. NOTICE THIS LAYOUT. WE LEFT SCHOOL. THESE ARE FROM TWO PUBLISHERS. ONE, HARPERCOLLINS, A KNOWN WHITE AMERICAN COMPANY, AND THE OTHER, BROADSIDE PRESS, ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR PUBLISHERS OF BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WRITERS. WE LURK LATE. REVOLUTIONARY. COME ON, TIFFANY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. THINK ABOUT IT. YES. CHANGE. THANK YOU FOR THE ASSIST, TOMIKA. WE STRIKE STRAIGHT. NOW, IN THE HARPERCOLLINS VERSION, LAYOUT'S PRETTY COMMON. LARGE TITLES, WORDS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH STANZA CAPITALIZED. THERE'S ALMOST AN ATTEMPT TO ERASE THE IDEA THAT THE PIECE IS WRITTEN IN BROKEN ENGLISH. WE SING SIN. BUT IN THE BROADSIDE PRESS VERSION, THE FONT LOOKS LIKE GRAFFITI WRITING, NOT WHAT WE NORMALLY SEE IN OUR TEXTBOOK. THAT'S RIGHT, DeSHAWN. BECAUSE GRAFFITI WRITING REPS THE 'HOOD. AND I WOULD AGREE. IT DOESN'T GET THE SAME RESPECT. WE THIN GIN. SO, WHY DO YOU THINK THIS INDEPENDENT BLACK PRESS DECIDED TO LAY OUT THE POEM IN THIS BROKEN GRAFFITI STYLE? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT RULES AND STRUCTURE? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG MEN IN THIS POEM? WE JAZZ JUNE. POOL PLAYERS IN THIS POEM ARE TEENAGERS. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ON A SCHOOL DAY? WHAT ARE THEY DOING AT A POOL HALL ON A SCHOOL DAY? WE DIE. D--D-
- SO, MS. BROOKS IS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING HERE. SHE'S SAYING THEY SKIPPING SCHOOL, HANGING AROUND BARS, THINNING GIN, JAZZING JUNE. YES, DARNELL, JUNE IS A GIRL'S NAME. SO, JAZZING JUNE MEANS-
- OK, PAUL, I THINK YOU COULD COME UP WITH A BETTER PHRASE, BUT LAYING THAT PIMP GAME WILL DO FOR NOW. WE REAL COOL. NOW, SOME MIGHT LOOK AT THE BROADSIDE PRESS VERSION, THINK IT'S INVALID 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THE RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE. WE LEFT SCHOOL. LOOKS LIKE STREET WRITING. OMARI: WE LURK LATE. BUT SOMETIMES RULES ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN. WE STRIKE STRAIGHT. SOMETIMES, THE STREET HAS VALUABLE LESSONS, TOO. WE SING SIN. NOW, MS. BROOKS HAS HER OWN RULES. WE THIN GIN. SHE BREAKS UP THE WE BEFORE EACH LINE BECAUSE SHE WANTS US TO PAUSE. WE...JAZZ JUNE. SHE WANTS US TO THINK ABOUT THAT WE BEFORE THE NEXT LINE. WE...DI--DI--DI... EACH WE QUESTIONS THEIR EXISTENCE AND WORTH. WE...DI--DI--DI... BECAUSE WHO ARE THEY AT POOL HALLS? SKIPPING SCHOOL, DRINKING, HAVING SEX, HANGING LATE. WHAT WILL THEY BECOME? WE... GWENDOLYN BROOKS GIVES US THE ANSWER ON HER LAST LINE. WE... A LINE THAT HAUNTS US ALL. WE... A LINE THAT WILL BECOME THEIR EPITHET. WE... BOTH: WE DIE... NYA: SOON. WHAT? I SAID, WE DIE SOON. I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN-
- UH, CAN'T FIND MY PLACE-
- NO, NO, I'M FINE, SHAWNA. THANK YOU. I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT-
- OH, FOR TODAY. UH, SORRY. I'M GONNA STEP OUT. YOU CAN WORK SILENTLY, OK? WORK ON YOUR OWN RESPONSE TO THE POEM. I'M GONNA STEP OUT. PLEASE DON'T GET OUT OF YOUR SEATS. DARNELL, PAUL. I'M SERIOUS. THANK YOU. [CRYING] OHH. DUN: YO! HEY, HEY. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. I'M FINE. YOU SURE? NO. YEAH. I'M PERFECTLY FINE. 'CAUSE IF ONE OF THOSE LITTLE SUCKAS IS IN THERE CAUSING PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW YOU JUST GOTTA HIT ME UP, RIGHT? I'M FINE. I CAN HANDLE MY SON JUST FINE. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP. YOUR SON? WHAT? I SAID MY STUDENT. WHY ARE YOU-
- 'CAUSE YOU JUST-
- LOOK, I HAVE WORK TO DO. HEY, YOU... YOU OK? I'M ... AMAZING. OUR SCHOOL IS ... BITCHES CAN'T NEVER MIND THEIR OWN DAMN BUSINESS. GOSSIP WHORES AT EVERY LEVEL. IT'S LIKE PRIVATE SCHOOL FOR WHAT? FOR WHO? AIN'T NOTHING YOU DO HERE PRIVATE. MY PARENTS ARE STUPID CRAZY PAYING ALL THIS MONEY JUST TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM THE KIDS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE SO DAMN SPOOKED I'LL END UP GETTING PREGNANT OR SHOT OR SOME ... IF I GO TO PUBLIC, BUT I'M LIKE, THEY MUST'VE NEVER BEEN AT THE STAIRCASE HERE AT FRICKIN' FERNBROOK, 'CAUSE FOR REALS, IT'S ALL TYPES OF TEEN ... GOING ON, AND THESE RICH BITCHES ARE THE NASTIEST, STRAIGHT UP. IT'S LIKE THEY PRIVILEGE BOUGHT THEM SOME EXTRA FREAK OR SOMETHING. OR MAYBE THEY AIN'T NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE SO DESPERATE, SO, THEY'D RATHER FIGURE THAT OUT THROUGH SEX OR WHATEVER. IT'S TRAGIC. AND I CANNOT KEEP MYSELF HERE IN THIS WASTELAND OF TALENT. STUCK-UP GIRLS IN MY DORM ACTING LIKE I'M GONNA STEAL THEIR FABRIC SOFTENER OR GRAB THEIR GRANNY PANTIES OUT THE LAUNDRY 'CAUSE I DON'T GOT MY OWN OR WHATEVER. LIKE, ARE YOU SERIOUS, BITCH? I MAY NOT HAVE YOUR MONEY, BUT I HAVE BOTH MY MOTHER AND FATHER AT HOME, WORKING THEIR ASSES OFF AT TWO JOBS JUST TO HAVE ME STUDY UP HERE WITH THE REST OF YOU BECAUSE THEY THINK YOUR PRIVILEGE WILL RUB OFF ON ME BY ASSOCIATION OR SOME ... . OR MAYBE THEY BELIEVE IN THE FALSE GOD OF THIS FRICKIN' FERNBROOK ACADEMY THAT SOMEHOW IT PRODUCES BETTER PEOPLE, BUT I KEEP TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT SOMEONE LIKE ME WOULD ACTUALLY SURVIVE BETTER IN AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH I'M COMFORTABLE INSTEAD OF BEING THE TOKEN POOR GIRL OF COLOR THAT EVERYONE THINKS IS TRYING TO SLEEP WITH THEIR ... BOYFRIEND OR STEAL THEIR GODDAMN COCAINE OR CRYSTAL METH OR WHATEVER. MEANWHILE, THE WORST ... MY FRIENDS ON THE BLOCK ARE SMOKING IS WEED. IF IT WASN'T FOR MR. PETERSON'S SCIENCE CLASS AND OMARI, I WOULD SLIT MY WRISTS. THAT'S WHY I'M GOIN' AFTER O. HE AIN'T GONNA LEAVE ME HERE TO ROT WITH THESE BOUGIE BRAINWASHED BRATS. I'M FOLLOWING MY MAN AND YOU GONNA READ ABOUT THIS IN ONE OF THEM URBAN ROMANCE NOVELS. IT'S CALLED GHETTO LOVE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Y-YO, I GOT COMPANY. LET ME CALL YOU BACK. I GOT MORE BITCHIN' TO DO. THAT WAS ONLY HALF. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] JASMINE. HI. CAN WE TALK? OK. I CAME UP TO GET OMARI. I FIGURED THAT. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE WITH HIS THINGS, MEET ME DOWNSTAIRS, BUT HE'S NOT THERE. NOT IN HIS ROOM. NOWHERE. REALLY? YOU KNOW WHERE HE MIGHT BE? SORRY, MS. JOSEPH. I DON'T KNOW. YOU SURE? I'M SURE. YOU SEE HIM AT ALL TODAY? EARLIER. I-
- I SAW HIM EARLIER. DID HE SEEM UPSET? WAS HE HIMSELF? DID YOU NOTICE-
- I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I MEAN, I WASN'T THERE, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE HIM PUT HIS HANDS ON-
- BUT I WAS INFORMED. I WAS IN CLASS AT THE TIME AND HE WAS HAVING A BAD DAY, I THINK. A BAD DAY? SOMETIMES, SOMEBODY MESS WITH YOU ON THE WRONG DAY. IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S YOUR LAST STRAW. BUT THEY AIN'T SEEN HOW MANY TIMES YOU BEEN SUCKED OUTTA EVERYTHING YOU GOT. THEY GO PICKING AT YOU LIKE LINT AND THEN BE LOOKIN' SURPRISED WHEN YOU KNOCK 'EM FLAT THE HELL OUT. JASMINE. YES? HE'S MY ONLY SON, YOU KNOW? I KNOW. I'M NOT HERE TO HURT HIM. I'M HERE BECAUSE I LOVE HIM. I WANT TO HELP MAKE THINGS ALL RIGHT. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? OF COURSE I DO. SO, I NEED YOUR HELP. MISS, I DON'T KNOW. OK. I HEAR THAT. IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE THE PERSON HE TALKS TO THE MOST. DID YOU KNOW THAT? AM I? ABSOLUTELY. THE MOST. AND IF ANYBODY, IF ANYONE WOULD KNOW HIS PLAN, MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE... ME? EXACTLY. WOW. THAT'S REAL. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OF THIS TO THE SCHOOL RIGHT NOW. HE'S SUPPOSED TO GET HIS THINGS, BE WAITING FOR ME DOWNSTAIRS. THAT'S OUR NORMAL ROUTINE. HIS COUNSELOR LEFT HIM TO GO PACK HIS BAG, BUT NOW NO OMARI, AND IF I ASK THE SCHOOL, THEY'RE GONNA SOUND AN ALARM, MAKE MORE OF A PROBLEM, AND WHATEVER TROUBLE OMARI IS IN, HE'LL BE FACED WITH MORE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? GOD, MISS JOSEPH, THEY'RE UNREASONABLE! OK. W--WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? HE'S NOT A CRIMINAL. I KNOW THAT. I DON'T THINK HE'S A CRIMINAL, EITHER. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE HE IS. SOMETIMES, PEOPLE PUSH YOU TOO FAR. THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A ANIMAL FROM ANOTHER JUNGLE, LIKE YOU DON'T BELONG EVEN WHEN YOU'RE HERE, 'CAUSE THEY GOT EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU OF THE WILD. SO, YOU BECOME THAT EXPECTATION, BUT IT AIN'T BORN IN YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO BE. IT'S WHAT YOU BECOME. THAT'S THE CRAZY OF FERNBROOK. JASMINE. HE'S MY HEART, MISS J. I LOVE HIM. THEN TELL ME WHERE HE IS. I AIN'T NO SNITCH. SNITCH? I STILL COME FROM WHAT I COME FROM. THIS PLACE DON'T CHANGE THAT. JASMINE, YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT. NOT EXACTLY ANYWAY. OK, WHAT DO--WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I GOT IDEAS IF I'M IN HIS HEAD RIGHT, BUT I DON'T KNOW NOTHING FOR SURE. OK, GIVE ME SOME IDEAS HERE. I CAN'T DO THAT. DON'T ASK ME. PLEASE, MISS. I'M NOT HIS BETRAYER. BETRAY--WHOO-
- OOH, JASMINE. TRYING TO BE CALM. I'M TRYING NOT TO UNRAVEL, UNLEASH. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU UNLEASH. THIS ISN'T AN ACT OF LOYALTY, NOT FOR REAL. IN YOUR HEAD, MAYBE, BUT IN REALITY, IN REALITY, YOU'RE SENTENCING HIM TO AN-
- I NEED TO FIND HIM. YOU LOOK REAL STRESSED, MISS. OK, I'M VERY STRESSED. HE'S MY SON. I UNDERSTAND. I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LOVE HIM HARD, BELIEVE ME. DO YOU? HIS UNPREDICTABILITY IS MANIC. IT'S EXCRUCIATING SOMETIMES, LIKE NAILS GOING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEART MUSCLE, BUT INSIDE YOU KNOW HE'S LIKE AN INFANT NEEDING SOME KIND OF NURTURE, AND THERE'S A SWEETNESS TO HIM THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO GIVE IT. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING JUST TO HOLD HIM TIGHT. JASMINE, THIS ISN'T HELPING. DID YOU EVER LIKE ME, MISS? WHAT? WHEN I'D COME OVER, YOU HARDLY EVER REALLY-
- IT'S LIKE YOU WAS POLITE BUT NOT NICE. I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. I DON'T SEE WHAT THIS HAS TO DO WITH FINDING-
- I'M NOT TRYING TO GRILL YOU OR NOTHING. I JUST WAS ALWAYS CURIOUS. LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING WRONG I DID I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT-
- SAT IN YOUR FAVORITE CHAIR ONCE, DRANK THE LAST OF SOME JUICE I DIDN'T KNOW WAS NEAR EMPTY. LIKE IF IT WAS SOME ACTION OF MINE OR JUST MY PRESENCE ALONE. I'D UNDERSTAND EITHER WAY, JUST ALWAYS WONDERED. JASMINE. I DON'T DISLIKE YOU. YEAH. BUT YOU DON'T LIKE ME, EITHER, RIGHT? I MEAN, I DON'T DISLIKE YOU. THAT'S LIKE PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE, SORT OF. IT'S NOT COMMITTING TO LOVING OR HATING. IT'S ALMOST WORSE, LIKE INDIFFERENT. IT'S HARD TO LIKE SOMEONE... IT'S HARD TO LIKE SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW BEYOND A FEW HELLOS. SOMEONE SMART AND CUTE MOST DAYS. STILL SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW. SOMEONE WITH A HEART SO BIG, THE SKY COULDN'T HOLD IT. SOMEONE WHO I'M SURE IS GREAT IN HER OWN WAY. SOMEONE DEFINITELY GREAT IN EVERY WAY. OK. SURE. BUT SOMEONE ALSO DATING YOUR SON. MY ONLY SON. EXACTLY. LIKE THE WAY YOU JUST SAID THAT. I MEAN, THAT WAS KIND OF LIKE... THAT WAS ALMOST A THREAT. UHH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LIKE... AND, EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE, PLEASE, BUT IT WAS LIKE, YEAH, BITCH, THAT'S MY ONLY SON, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE HIM FROM ME OR WHATEVER. I SAID, EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE, PLEASE. I HOPE YOU HEARD THAT PART. YEAH, I HEARD THAT PART. HEARD IT. AHEM. JASMINE, DO YOU HAVE ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS? THIS LIKE A BONDING QUESTION OR INTERROGATION QUESTION? WHATEVER KIND GETS AN ANSWER. I'M AN ONLY CHILD LIKE O. WE CONNECT THAT WAY. I SEE. BUT I GOT AN OLDER COUSIN AND ONE YOUNGER, BOTH BOYS. THEY'RE LIKE BROTHERS TO ME SOMETIMES. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AS A WOMAN, WORRYING ABOUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO THEM WHEN THEY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD EVERY DAY? UM, THEY JUST MY COUSINS, SO-
- IT'S A GAMBLE, JASMINE, ALL THE TIME. YOU SEND YOUR YOUNG MAN OUT INTO THE WORLD FOR A DAY, AWAY FOR A WEEKEND, A SEMESTER, A SCHOOL YEAR, AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA, YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY'RE SAFE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF SOMEONE WILL TRY TO EXPIRE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO YOUNG OR TOO BLACK OR TOO THREATENING, TOO LOUD, TOO UNINFORMED, TOO ANGRY, TOO QUIET, TOO EVERYDAY, TOO COOL, TOO UNCOMPOSED, TOO MYSTERIOUS, OR JUST TOO TOO. YOU HAVE NO IDEA, AND IT'S FRIGHTENING, JASMINE. IT SENDS A TREMBLE THROUGH YOUR HEART ON THE DAILY. BUT IF SOMEONE COULD EASE THAT TREMBLE BY UNVEILING JUST A LITTLE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE, IT WOULD MEAN EVERYTHING. DO YOU GET ME? MEN ARE A PUZZLE, STRAIGHT UP. I GET YOU. SO I KNOW YOU WANT TO PROTECT OMARI. I KNOW YOU CARE FOR HIM DEEPLY. SO DEEP I GOT INDIGESTION OVER HERE. BUT KEEPING HIS WHEREABOUTS A SECRET, THAT'S NOT HELPING HIM, YOU HEAR ME? NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU KNOW? GO FOLLOW HIM, CONVINCE HIM NOT TO DO SOMETHING HE SET HIS MIND TO? YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE? I WOULDN'T BE WORTH MY SALT AS A MOTHER IF I DIDN'T. MS. JOSEPH, I KNOW YOU THINK MAYBE I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR SON. MY PARENTS THINK NOBODY'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. I GET IT. NOBODY'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR NOBODY. BUT ME AND O, WE GOT SOMETHING REAL. AND EVEN IF YOU THINK I'M WORTHLESS, I'M STILL GONNA LOVE HIM. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WORTH-
- NAH, YOU DO. YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT YOU DO. I CAN SMELL WHEN I DON'T MAKE SENSE TO SOMEBODY. I MAKE YOU AFRAID JUST LIKE O MAKES MY PARENTS AFRAID. IT'S LIKE YOU SEND US HERE TO BECOME THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. YOU WANT US TO HAVE SO MUCH. YOU WANT TO PROTECT US FROM OURSELVES. YOU LOVE US, AND WE KNOW THAT, BUT YOU HATE US, TOO. YOU HATE US HAVING A MIND OF OUR OWN. YOU HATE THAT WE CAN'T BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU IMAGINED IN YOUR HEAD, AND THAT SCARES YOU, THAT WE DON'T BELONG TO YOU, THAT SOMEONE COULD COME ALONG AND WE MIGHT LOVE THEM MORE THAN WE LOVE YOU. YOU HATE US FOR THAT. WE CAN FEEL IT INSIDE, AND IT'LL MAKE US LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK! WHERE IS... MY SON? JASMINE. MAYBE THE TRAIN STATION OR THE BUS. TO GO WHERE? HE DIDN'T SAY. BUT HE SAID IT WAS GOOD-BYE. DID SOMEONE COME AND PICK HIM UP? HE CAUGHT A RIDE WITH BRIAN. HE TOLD THE COUNSELOR HE WAS COMING UP TO PACK UP HIS CLOTHES. THEY LET HIM GO, AND HE SNUCK OUT WITH BRIAN. I TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM NOT TO GO, STICK OUT HIS FATE LIKE A MAN, BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN NO MORE TO YOU. WHY WOULD HE BE A-
- THEY VIDEOED HIM, MISS. IT'S GONNA GO VIRAL. SOMEBODY ALREADY SENT ME A TEXT. JESUS. HE THOUGHT HE'D BRING YOU SO MUCH SHAME. HE THOUGHT HE'D RUIN YOU. DID HE MENTION A PLACE? I NEED TO KNOW NOW. I NEED TO KNOW. I'M TELLING YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW. BETRAYAL ALL DAY. THINK FOR A MINUTE. I NEED TO KNOW BEFORE I LEAVE. DID HE MENTION ANY OTHER PLACE? I TOLD YOU WHAT I KNOW FOR SURE. YOU GOING HOME EARLY FOR THE WEEKEND, JASMINE? UM-
- DO NOT ... ME. YOU PLANNING ON MEETING HIM SOMEWHERE. I WAS PLANNING ON SEARCHING. SEARCHING WHERE? THE TRAIN STATION, THE BUS. I SWEAR, THAT'S IT. I DON'T HAVE NOTHING ELSE. HE KEPT SAYING HE HAD TO DO THIS ON HIS OWN, HE HAD MONEY FROM HIS FATHER, CHILD SUPPORT STASH. HE SAID HE'D BE OK. HAS HE CALLED OR TEXTED YOU? NO. I WISH, BUT NO. OK, LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN. IF HE CALLS, TEXTS, GETS ONLINE, DOES ANYTHING TO REACH YOU, YOU CALL ME IMMEDIATELY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? HE WON'T, MISS. YOU'RE CUT OUT, AND SO AM I. JUST DO WHAT I SAY! [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: [Music] GIVING UP [Music] [Music] IS HARD TO DO [Music] [Music] WHEN YOU REALLY [Music] [Music] LOVE SOMEONE [Music] [Music] GIVING UP [Music] [Music] SO HARD TO DO [Music] [Music] WHEN YOU [Music] [Music] STILL DEPEND UPON [Music] [Music] HER WARM AND TENDER TOUCH [Music] [Music] HER KISS AND HER CARESS [Music] [Music] OOH [Music] [Music] THAT USED TO MEAN SO MUCH [Music] [Music] AND BRING YOU HAPPINESS [Music] [Music] WHOA [Music] [Music] GIVING UP [Music] I'M BACK, MA. I SEE. I, UM-
- WHERE YOU BEEN? WITH SOME FRIENDS. FRIENDS? JUST TRYING TO CATCH A BUS OVER TO PHILLY. PHILLY? WHAT--PHILLY? MY BOY RASHAD GOT A SMALL CRIB THERE FROM WHEN HIS FATHER PASSED. SAID HE HAD A COUCH. SO THAT'S THE PLAN, HUH-
- RUN OFF AND NOT FACE ANY OF THIS? LEAVE ME HERE TO DEAL WITH THE MESS. THAT'S THE PLAN? IT WAS SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A PLAN. SO WHAT HAPPENED, YOUR PLAN GO AWRY? NO, I JUST... I DON'T KNOW, MA. I JUST CAME BACK. [SIGHS] I SEE. YOU BEEN SMOKING. AND YOU BEEN FIGHTING. I... YOU WANT TO HEAR, OR DO YOU EVEN CARE? DON'T DO THAT, OMARI. DO WHAT? ASK IF I CARE. DEFLECT, PUT THIS ON ME. THAT'S NOT GONNA FLOAT RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT TRYING TO DEFLECT, MA. I'M ASKING IF YOU CARE TO HEAR OR IF YOU PREFER NOT TO HEAR, 'CAUSE MAYBE THE DETAILS WON'T MAKE IT BETTER RIGHT NOW. I ALWAYS CARE. I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T. THEN, YES, TELL ME THE GORY DETAILS, TELL ME WHAT DEVIL GOT INTO YOUR HANDS, MADE YOU ATTACK YOUR TEACHER. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, MA. MAKE ME. I WANT TO START BY SAYING I'M NOT JUSTIFYING. THERE'S NO WAY TO... I'M NOT JUSTIFYING, BUT EVERYTHING I SAY NOW IS JUST THE HOW, YOU KNOW, THE HOW AND WHY, BUT NOT THE EXCUSE. I'M NOT MAKING NONE OF THOSE NO MORE. I'M DONE. GIVE ME THE HOW. COULDN'T SEE STRAIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I KNOW FOR SURE. IT'S LIKE I WENT BLIND FOR A SECOND, NO INSIGHT, NO OUTER. I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE WEEK. WHAT BLINDED YOU, OMARI? HE KEPT QUESTIONING ME IN CLASS. QUESTIONING YOU HOW? DIDN'T FEEL LIKE BEING BOTHERED. I SAID THAT TO HIM, MA. I TOLD HIM I WASN'T IN THE MOOD FOR BEING QUESTIONED. OMARI, HE'S YOUR TEACHER. HE HAS THE RIGHT TO QUESTION YOU. NAH, HE DON'T, NOT HOW HE WAS DOING. BEEN DOING IT A LOT, AND I WAS SICK OF IT. WE GET TO DISCUSSING THE READING, NATIVE SON, RICHARD WRIGHT, AND HE START ASKING QUESTIONS. WHAT MADE BIGGER THOMAS KILL THAT WOMAN? WHAT WERE HIS SOCIAL LIMITATIONS? WHAT MADE THE ANIMAL IN HIM EXPLODE? AND WHO HE LOOKING AT WHEN HE ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS, MA? WHO HE LOOKING AT? OMARI-
- LIKE I'M THE SPOKESPERSON, LIKE I'M BIGGER THOMAS, LIKE I'M PREDISPOSED TO SOME ... TO KNOWING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AN ANIMAL. OMARI, WATCH YOUR MOUTH. YOU HEAR ME, THOUGH? YOU HEAR WHAT HE DOING? HE START PICKING ME OUT, ASKING ME TO ANSWER. WHAT DID I DISCOVER WHEN READING THE TEXT? HE'S YOUR TEACHER. HE'S SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE TEXT, OMARI. NAH, HE AIN'T. HE AIN'T JUST QUESTIONING ME ABOUT NATIVE SON. HE AIN'T JUST TALKING TEXT. HE'S SAYING SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING BENEATH THE QUESTION, AND IT'S LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HEAR IT. THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO LOSE YOUR COOL. THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO BE THE ANIMAL HERE. BUT IT'S ALL HE'S SEEING. WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE. I SAID, MISTER, DON'T PICK ON ME TODAY. I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO OFFER, BUT HE WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE. A TEACHER'S SUPPOSED TO ENGAGE YOU, EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. THAT'S THE TEACHER'S JOB. NOW, I TOLD YOU THAT REPEATEDLY, OMARI. WE'RE NOT TALKING THE TEACHER DOING THEIR JOB. WE TALKING PROVOKING. WE TALKING AGITATING. WE TALKING SINGLING ME OUT. YOU KNOW THAT, MA? ON A DAY WHERE... WHERE I DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING SINGLED OUT. WE TALKING RESPECTING MY SPACE. NO. NO, YOU IN SCHOOL. YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR PERSONAL SPACE. YOU'RE IN A COLLECTIVE SPACE, A SPACE TO ENGAGE, TO BE QUESTIONED, TO BE STIMULATED, TO BE PROVOKED. THAT'S EDUCATION, OMARI. I'M TALKING BIASED EDUCATION, MA. I'M TALKING DISRESPECT. HE KNOWS. HE KNOWS HE WAS-
- HE WAS SAYING SOMETHING. ASKING ME IN THAT ROOM IN THAT WAY IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE STUDENTS ON THAT ISSUE, HE WAS SAYING SOMETHING DIRECTLY TO ME. I KNOW HE WAS. EVEN IF HE WAS, EVEN IF, WHAT YOU TELLING ME? YOU TELLING ME THAT MAKE YOU ATTACK YOUR TEACHER? YOU TRYING TO DRAW SOME PERPENDICULAR LINE HERE, 'CAUSE I'M NOT SEEING WHERE THESE THINGS CROSS. I TOLD HIM TO BACK OFF. YEAH, YOU SAID THAT ALREADY. I TOLD HIM, MA, AND HE KEPT DIGGING. AND THEN? AND THEN HE SAYS, MR. JOSEPH, YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS MANDATORY HERE. TELL THE CLASS YOUR PERSPECTIVE OR TAKE A ZERO FOR THE DAY. STILL NOT SEEING. YOU THREATEN MY GRADES, YOU THREATEN TO PUNISH ME IN FRONT OF THE CLASS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR TOKEN RESPONDER. THAT'S ... YOU CUSSING LIKE THAT? YOU SAVING THAT DISRESPECT FOR ME PERSONALLY. I'M SORRY, JUST AMPED, MAKING A POINT. NO, BUT YOU HAVEN'T MADE A POINT YET, OMARI. YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ANY INDICATION WHY YOUR BEHAVIOR WAS WARRANTED. YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING EXCEPT SPEAK AS IF YOU'RE ABOVE REPROACH. AND YOU'RE NOT. FORGET IT, MA. NO. LET'S NOT FORGET IT. NO, LET'S. I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T. I KNEW THIS WAS FUTILE. THIS IS YOUR THIRD STRIKE, OMARI. THE WORST ONE. YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR TEACHER. YOU ATTACK YOUR TEACHER? I PUSHED HIM. I DIDN'T ATTACK HIM. YOU THINK THEY CARE ABOUT YOUR SEMANTICS? I PUSHED HIM AND HE FELL AGAINST THE BOARD. YOU SLAMMED A TEACHER AGAINST A BOARD. NOW THAT'S SOME SEMANTICS. IT WAS RECORDED BY OTHER STUDENTS, AND NOBODY'S GONNA SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? I TRIED TO GET UP AND LEAVE. HE WOULDN'T LET ME LEAVE. THAT'S UNREASONABLE. I TOLD HIM I WASN'T IN THE MOOD, MA. I TOLD HIM. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR MOODS. EXACTLY. THEY DON'T CARE, MA. THEY DON'T CARE WHAT SPACE AND PLACE I'M IN. I KNOW ME. I KNOW HOW TO LEARN. I KNOW WHEN I'M GOOD AND WHEN I'M NOT, AND I SAID IT. I'M NOT GOOD. I SAID THAT. THEN YOU ASK FOR PERMISSION TO BE EXCUSED. YOU SAY, HEY! MM. I NEED TO SPEAK TO MY COUNSELOR IMMEDIATELY. YOU DON'T WALK OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A LESSON LIKE YOU SOME KING OR GOD THAT NO ONE CAN TAME. TAME? DAMN IT, OMARI. TAME? DON'T DO THAT. DON'T--DON'T... TWIST AND REMODEL THE CONVO AND CHANGE MY MEANING. I'M NOT CHANGING ANYTHING. I'M REPEATING VERBATIM. SO WHY ARE YOU HERE? HUH? WHAT'D YOU COME BACK HERE FOR? HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO? I JUST... AIN'T WANT TO LEAVE THAT WAY. SO WHAT'S THIS? THIS OUR GOOD-BYE? YOU COME TO TELL ME GOOD-BYE? MA-
- YOU DROPPING OUT? YOU LEAVING SCHOOL? A SCHOOL YOUR FATHER AND I VETTED FOR YOU, A SCHOOL THAT WAS GONNA GIVE YOU A-
- GIVE ME ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES, MAKE ME A BETTER MAN THAN I'D BE IF I JUST WENT TO YOUR SCHOOL, IF I JUST STAYED HERE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. DON'T GIVE ME HIS SPEECH, MA. THOSE IS HIS WORDS, NOT YOURS. YOUR FATHER THOUGHT IT BEST IF-
- BETTER THAN STAYING WITH HIM. OMARI JUST AIN'T SURVIVING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. HE'S TOO SMART. HE COULD BE SOMETHING, NYA, JUST NOT IN THIS 'HOOD. LET'S SEND HIM UPSTATE AND OUT OF BOTH OF OUR HAIR. THAT'S WHAT MY FATHER THOUGHT. THAT'S WHERE HIS MONEY'S GOING. DON'T DO THAT. DON'T SPEAK FOR HIM. OR ME OR US. DON'T INTERPRET. YOU LOST IN TRANSLATION. I'M NOT LOST. YOU ARE. YOU ARE. [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] [LIGHTER FLICKS] GOING TO KILL YOURSELF WITH THESE. YOU CELEBRATING MY DISAPPEARANCE? OMARI. NOT FUNNY, I KNOW, BUT IT'S LIKE... LIKE A HOMEGOING OR SOMETHING UP IN HERE. I AIN'T DIE, MA. SORRY. WE SHOULD, UM... GET FOOD OR SOMETHING, RIGHT? I'M STARVED AND-
- I'LL COOK US SOME PASTA. WHAT DID I DO? TELL ME. MA, DON'T DO THIS. I NEED TO KNOW IF I HURT YOU, IF I MISSTEPPED, I FORGOT TOO MUCH, I DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH. MA, THIS AIN'T YOU. 'CAUSE I'VE TRIED, LIKE RELIGIOUSLY, LIKE AN ONGOING PRAYER, TO PROTECT YOU, BUFFER YOU FROM IT ALL, FLEE YOU, FREE YOU, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR FATHER, FROM OTHER MOTHERS, FROM MY OWN MOTHER, FROM WHOMEVER. [SIGHS] I STILL DON'T-
- I STILL DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER. WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY? THEY COULD PRESS CHARGES. WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY? TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME. I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO STOP THEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY. I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW WHAT-
- I WANT INSTRUCTIONS. I WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR YOU. I WOULD SUFFOCATE THE SUN FOR YOU. I WOULD STEAL THE SKY FOR YOU. I WOULD BLIND MOSES FOR YOU. I WOULD STRIP THE WIND, THE RAIN, THE FORESTS FOR YOU. BEFORE YOU DIE OR ROT OR LOSE YOUR FREEDOM, I WOULD SURRENDER MY OWN. YOU KNOW THAT? I WOULD DIE IF YOU COULD BE BORN AGAIN WITHOUT THIS OPPRESSIVE RAGE. I JU--I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I NEED YOU TO TELL ME. TELL ME HOW TO SAVE YOU. TELL ME HOW TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER LIFE. TELL ME WHAT WOULD TAKE THIS FAILURE AWAY. 'CAUSE I LISTEN TO EVERYBODY ELSE. I'M READY TO LISTEN TO YOU. GUIDE ME. GIVE ME THE ANSWER. GIVE IT TO ME. I WILL DO IT, I SWEAR. MA. I DON'T KNOW. I'M HUNGRY. GONNA COOK US SOMETHING. YOU GONNA EAT? NO, I'M GONNA SIT HERE... WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS. [STIFLED SOBBING] [MUSIC PLAYING] OMARI: WE REAL COOL. WE LEFT SCHOOL. WE LURK LATE. WE STRIKE STRAIGHT. WE... WE... WE... WE STRIKE, STRIKE, STRIKE, STRIKE! WOMAN OVER P.A.: MS. JOSEPH, PLEASE CALL THE MAIN OFFICE. YOU HAVE A VISITOR. THANK YOU. HEY, HASSELHOFF, IT'S JOSEPH. YEAH. HE IS? SHOOT. WOULD YOU SEND HIM UP, PLEASE? THANK YOU. IT'S RIGHT HERE. OK. [MUTTERS] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [CLEARS THROAT] COME IN. HI, NYA. HI, XAVIER. [LAUGHS] SORRY TO STOP BY DURING SCHOOL HOURS. THEY SAID THIS IS YOUR FREE PERIOD. YEAH. JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGE THIS MORNING. LOST MY PHONE YESTERDAY. HAD A MILLION CLIENTS TO TRACK DOWN. MARKETING ACCOUNTS WENT CRAZY. IT'S FINE. I JUST TOOK HALF A DAY, LEFT THE FIRM AND CAME STRAIGHT DOWN HERE. OH, OK. CAN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON? YEAH, SURE. OK. HE HIT A TEACHER? PUSHED HIM AGAINST THE SMARTBOARD. JESUS. WHY? UM, I'M NOT SURE. HE SAID HE WAS HAVING A BAD DAY. A BAD DAY? SAID HE WAS, UM, BEING HARASSED BY THE TEACHER MORE THAN THE OTHER STUDENTS, SAID HE FELT TARGETED, WASN'T IN THE MOOD FOR ANY OF IT. WELL, THAT'S NO EXCUSE. I TOLD HIM THAT. WHERE IS HE NOW? HOME, I THINK. HOME. YOU THINK? [SIGHS] I LEFT HIM AT HOME. HE'S BEEN SUSPENDED. THEY'RE GOING TO DELIBERATE, DECIDE WHETHER TO EXPEL HIM, AND PRESS CHARGES. AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. I'M LETTING IT COOL OVER THE WEEKEND. I'M HOPING SOME OF THE STEAM WILL BLOW OFF, THEY'LL BE MORE LENIENT. WELL, THIS IS HIS THIRD STRIKE. YEAH, IT IS. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE LENIENT WITH A THIRD STRIKE. WELL, I'M HOPING. HE SAID HE DIDN'T SLAM THAT TEACHER, BUT ON THE VIDEO, IT LOOKS LIKE HE PUSHED-
- THE VIDEO? YEAH. THERE'S A VIDEO? THE KIDS' PHONES. HOW DID THEY-
- I THOUGHT PHONES WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED. THEY'RE NOT. THEN HOW THE-
- THEY'RE GONNA USE THIS AGAINST HIM. HE WANTED TO RUN AWAY. HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY. AND THIS ALL HAPPENED YESTERDAY? I TRIED TO CALL. MY PHONE. YEAH. HA HA! DID I GIVE YOU SHEILA'S NUMBER? I DON'T RECALL GETTING SHEILA'S...NUMBER. WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU HER NUMBER. NEXT TIME YOU CAN'T REACH ME, CALL HER. SHE'LL REACH ME. YEAH, OK. DAMN, O. HOW'D IT GET TO THIS? HOW'D IT GET SO FAR OVER THE LINE? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU, GIVE YOU ANY ANSWERS? [LAUGHING] SOMETHING FUNNY? YOU THINK HE GIVES ME ANSWERS? HA HA HA! I'M JUST ASKING. HE OUGHT TO. HE'S SUPPOSED TO ANSWER TO YOU. HE'S YOUR SON. HE'S YOUR SON, TOO. WELL, I KNOW THAT. WHAT... WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WAS WHAT? THAT JUST FELT A BIT LIKE ACCUSATION. NO, I DIDN'T DO THAT. NO? NO. OK. OK. BECAUSE WE SAID WE WOULDN'T DO THAT. WE'RE NOT. CO-PARENTING. YES, EXACTLY. NO BLAMING. NO ONE IS BLAMING. OK. IT JUST SOUNDED LIKE-
- YEAH. YOU SAID, HE'S YOUR SON. BUT MINE WASN'T AN ACCU-
- BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU-
- I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM. I'M SAYING HE'S THE SON, YOU'RE HIS MOTHER. HE SHOULD BE GIVING ANSWERS WHEN HE'S QUESTIONED. HE'S THE SON. YEAH, RIGHT, OK, BUT YOU SAID HE'S MY SON, NOT THE SON. I MEANT THE SON. OH, OK. I'M THINKING... I'M THINKING HE NEEDS A CHANGE, A BIG ONE. YEAH. MAYBE HE SHOULD COME STAY WITH ME. YOU AND SHEILA? SHEILA STILL HAS HER PLACE. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT. YEAH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. MAYBE THEY WON'T PRESS CHARGES IF WE-
- IF WE TELL THEM WE'RE CHANGING HIS CIRCUMSTANCES. I'LL PULL HIM OUT OF FERNBROOK. HE'LL GET ENROLLED IN A SCHOOL IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. OR HE CAN GO HERE. HERE? YES, HERE, WHERE I TEACH, AND I'VE BEEN DOING SO FOR OVER A DECADE. NOT HERE. THERE ARE SOME GOOD TEACHERS HERE. THE SCHOOL IS FAILING, NYA. WAS FAILING. NOT ANYMORE. THEY DIVIDED US INTO 4 DIFFERENT SECTIONS. WE'RE DOING MUCH BETTER. AND THAT'S ABOUT STUDENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SCHOOL BOARD. THAT'S NOT THE STAFF HERE. NOT ALL OF US. LOOK. THERE ARE SOME GOOD TEACHERS HERE. HE KNOWS THEM. HE'LL BE COMFORTABLE. HE'LL BE HERE AND UNDER MY WATCH. OH, YOU CAN'T WATCH HIM ALL DAY. WELL, NEITHER CAN YOU. BUT I CAN GIVE HIM A BETTER SURROUNDING. BETTER? DON'T DO THAT. I'M NOT MAKING JUDGMENTS. LET'S NOT MAKE IT ABOUT THAT. LET'S KEEP IT ABOUT O. IT IS ABOUT O. NOW, YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN. I KNOW THAT. I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG. BUT YOU RESIST, YOU AND HIM, THE OFFERS I MAKE. NOW I'M NOT-
- YOU COULD BE PROUD. YOU COULD RIDE OR DIE FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ALL YOU WANT. THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR SON. AND YOU KNOW-
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST? SENDING HIM AWAY TO FERNBROOK DIDN'T STOP THE RAGE. YOU CAN'T SOLVE HIM FROM THE OUTSIDE IN. DON'T YOU SEE THAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, OUTSIDE IN? I'M WORKING WITH THE PARTS I GET, NYA. THAT'S ALL I GET ACCESS TO. HE DOESN'T LET ME IN. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT STILL ACTIVE. I WORK FROM WHATEVER WAY HE DICTATES. HE ALWAYS DICTATES, BUT HE'S THE SON. OUR SON. AND HE CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE DICTATOR. IT CAN'T ALWAYS BE A DEMOCRACY. SOMETIMES-
- AND I TRY, BUT YOU, IT'S LIKE WE'RE RUNNING TWO DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS. I THOUGHT IT WAS CO-PARENTING. SOMETIMES IT'S-
- AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T DO-
- YOU'RE NOT RUNNING YOUR PART, BUT I'M THE MAN, NOT YOU, AND HE NEEDS A FIRMER HAND. THAT ISN'T BLAME? MAYBE NOT ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE IN THE MATTER. MAYBE HE HAS TOO MANY DAMN CHOICES AND DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW A LEADER. HE THINKS IT'S HIM, BUT WHERE IS HE GOING? AND YOU DON'T THINK A FIRMER HAND WON'T MAKE HIM SUFFOCATE? YOU THINK I'M TOO LOOSE, SO HE'S SLIPPING DOWN THE PIPE? WELL, WHICH GRIP IS BEST? PLEASE SHOW ME. PLEASE SHOW ME. YOU ALWAYS DO THIS. DO WHAT? MAKE THIS PERSONAL, MAKE PARENTING OUR SON A PERSONAL BATTLE BETWEEN YOU AND I. IT IS BETWEEN YOU AND I. WE MADE HIM. IT'S NOT YOU AND I. IT'S YOU AND HIM, ME AND HIM, US AND HIM. THAT'S THE DEAL. YOU AND I WITHOUT HIM DOESN'T EXIST. OUCH. NO. NOT OUCH. YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THAT. I DON'T GET TO BE HURT? I CAN'T FEEL PAIN? NO. YOU DON'T GET TO DO THAT. OK. THAT'S FAIR. IT WAS PARTLY MY FAULT. I'M NOT LOOKING BACKWARDS. I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO. YOU BROKE THIS. NOT ME. YOU. I'M MOVING ON, AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME A BAD FATHER. I DIDN'T SAY IT DID. YOU ALSO DIDN'T TELL OUR SON WHO THE REAL VILLAIN IS, AND HE THINKS IT'S ME. I NEVER LET HIM THINK YOU'RE THE ENEMY. WELL, HE THINKS IT ANYWAY. AND NOW HE WON'T HARDLY LISTEN TO ME, WON'T RESPECT ME ANYMORE. THAT'S NOT ON ME. I NEVER--I NEVER BAD TALK YOU. YOU UPSET WITH ME BECAUSE I... THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FAIR. BUT YOU AND HIM AND WHATEVER IS BROKEN, THAT'S NOT ME. THEN LET HIM COME. LET HIM LIVE WITH ME. GIVE ME THAT AUTHORITY. I HAVEN'T ANY TO GIVE YOU. YOU THINK FORCING HIM IS GONNA SAVE HIM? DO IT. YOU WANT TO DICTATE, TRY IT. YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT REBELLION ON YOUR HANDS. I CAN DEAL WITH REBELLION. IT'S YOU. YOU'RE THE BARRICADE. WHEN YOU RESIST, HE CAN SNIFF IT. THEN I BECOME THE ENEMY. I WON'T RESIST. I'LL CALL THE SCHOOL ON MONDAY, FIRST THING. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. PULL HIM OUT OF SCHOOL AND ASK THEM NOT TO PRESS CHARGES. MAYBE THEY'LL LISTEN. THEN HE COMES WITH ME. THAT'S THE DEAL. THAT'S HOW WE FIX THIS. YOU AGREE? HOW DID WE GET HERE? ASK YOURSELF-
- I MISS YOU. I CAN'T, NYA. I KNOW. I KNOW. DO WE HAVE A DEAL? HE'LL HATE US BOTH. WELL, MAYBE JUST YOU THIS TIME. WELL, IF IT SAVES HIS LIFE, I'LL BE THE DEVIL. OK. BUT WE WAIT UNTIL MONDAY, UNTIL I CAN TELL HIM, UNTIL I CAN EFFECTIVELY RELEASE HIM. YOU CALL ME BEFORE YOU DO. I WANT TO BE ON MY WAY. I WANT HIM TO HAVE NOWHERE TO DISAPPEAR TO. YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS A DEAL. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] DON'T TELL ME THAT ...! THAT'S ... YOU THINK IT'S MY FAULT? DON'T TELL ME YOU CAME AS FAST AS YOU COULD. LAURIE, THAT WASN'T ME, OK? I DID WHAT I COULD. I CALLED. I ... CALLED, AND YOU DIDN'T ANSWER. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, WAIT FOREVER, LET THEM BUST THEIR HEADS WIDE OPEN ON MY WATCH? I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST STAND BACK AND WATCH? YOU DIDN'T CALL RIGHT AWAY. YOU DIDN'T. THAT'S WHAT THE KIDS ARE SAYING. LAURIE: ... WHAT THE KIDS ARE SAYING. ASK ANY TEACHER OVER HERE. ASK NYA. SHE'LL TELL YOU IT'S ... YOU TWO ALL RIGHT? DO I LOOK ALL RIGHT? LAURIE'S FIFTH PERIOD, DeSHAWN AND HAKEEM GOT INTO A FIGHT. NO? AGAIN? YOU HEAR THAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT THAT? SHE SAID AGAIN. THAT MEANS THESE TWO HAVE AN ONGOING BEEF. IT'S LIKE THE ... CRIPS AND THE BLOODS IN MY CLASSROOM. THESE KIDS ARE AT WAR. YOU WANT ME TO JUST WATCH THEM DROP GRENADES AND PRETEND LIKE THAT ... ISN'T LETHAL? I DIDN'T MAKE UP THE POLICY. NOT PROTECT THE CIVILIANS? NYA: DID COLDEN GIVE YOU ... ABOUT IT? DID COLDEN GIVE ME ... ABOUT IT? UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR. NO, I CAN TALK TO HIM. THOSE TWO HAVE BEEN AT IT IN MY ROOM, TOO. THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP. WHY'S IT NOT GONNA HELP? BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA THROW ME TO THE ... WOLVES. THAT'S WHY. BECAUSE YOU BROKE PROTOCOL. THERE IS NOT PROTOCOL IN WAR. THERE'S STOP TWO PEOPLE FROM KILLING EACH OTHER. THAT IS ALL. THE BROOM? WHAT IS IT I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN INSTEAD? PLEASE TELL ME HOW AN OVER-THE-HILL CHICK IS SUPPOSED TO STOP TWO TALL TEENAGE BOYS WITH WEIGHTLIFTING MUSCLES AND ZERO BODY FAT FROM POUNDING EACH OTHER INTO OBLIVION WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF FORCE. PLEASE TELL ME. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BROOM? I HIT DeSHAWN. SHE HIT DeSHAWN WITH A BROOM. TO SAVE HIS ... LIFE. IS THAT EVEN A FACTOR? DOES THAT EVEN MATTER? DUN: I'M NOT SAYING IT DO OR IT DON'T. I'M JUST TELLING HER WHAT WENT ... ..., LAURIE. ..., LAURIE? AND COLDEN KNOWS? OH, DeSHAWN WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND STRAIGHT TO THE OFFICE. NYA: GODDAMN. IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH ONE. THAT BROOM-
- WAS ALL I HAD! WHAT HAPPENED TO SECURITY? WE CAME. LAURIE: LATE. AS FAST AS WE COULD. HE HAD HIM ON THE FLOOR, BANGING HIS HEAD INTO THE FLOOR. DESKS WERE SCATTERING EVERYWHERE. KIDS WERE SCREAMING. I CALLED SECURITY, AND THE DAMN LINE WAS BUSY. WE WERE ON THE PHONE WITH BEKIM. HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT A KID WHO WAS HIGH IN HIS ROOM. LAURIE: SO WHAT THE HELL'S THE PROTOCOL FOR BUSY SIGNAL? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? STAND ASIDE TILL WE GET THERE. THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. OF COURSE IT DOESN'T WORK. IT'S STUPID. I HAVE A CLASSROOM FULL OF KIDS TO PROTECT AND MYSELF. I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF ADULT JUST STANDS THERE AND WATCHES HER STUDENTS FIGHT? WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? HE WAS POUNDING HIS HEAD INTO THE FLOOR LIKE THIS... LIKE HE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM. HAKEEM'S HEAD WAS SECONDS AWAY FROM SPLITTING OPEN. DeSHAWN WAS SEEING RED. I SCREAMED TO HIM TO STOP. DO YOU THINK HE COULD HEAR ME? HE COULDN'T HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD IN THAT MOMENT. DUN: I'M JUST SAYING WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS. I'M NOT SAYING YOU WERE WRONG. ... RIGHT, AND ... WRONG! THERE'S ONLY NECESSARY. WHAT DID COLDEN SAY? OH, HE'S TALKING TO THE PARENTS, THE SUPERINTENDENT. NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, EVERYBODY WHO DOESN'T KNOW ... ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TEACH IN A CLASSROOM IS GONNA BE MY JUDGE AND JURY. DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ANYTHING? YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO DeSHAWN'S MOTHER? OH, SHE'S THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES. ... KIDS AND THEIR CAMERA PHONES, IS EVERYTHING A GODDAMN YouTube SENSATION TO THEM? THEY DIDN'T. AND HOW THE HELL DID THEY GET PAST SECURITY WITH THOSE PHONES? PLEASE TELL ME. BACK TO ME AGAIN? IT'S A SIMPLE ... QUESTION. WELL, SOME STUFF GETS PAST. IT AIN'T THE AIRPORT. COULD'VE FOOLED ME. WHAT'S A METAL DETECTOR FOR IF IT DOESN'T, YOU KNOW, CATCH ALL THE METAL? DUN: WELL, CELL PHONES AIN'T THE METAL WE'RE MOST INTERESTED IN. WHAT CAN I SAY? DON'T SAY ... TO ME EVER AGAIN! LAURIE! YOU KEEP THINKING THIS IS ME. YOU ACT LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG. WHAT'D I DO WRONG? WAS I NOT ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR CALL FAST ENOUGH? WHEN IT'S ONLY EIGHT OF US WORKING 4 DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN ONE BUILDING, DID I NOT REACH YOU FAST ENOUGH? DID I NOT RUN FROM ONE HALLWAY TO ANOTHER AT A SPEED THAT MAKES YOU SATISFIED? I'M SO SORRY. I'M SO SORRY THAT WHEN I'M SITTING UP HERE BARELY BREAKING MINIMUM WAGE AND DEALING WITH THE ATTITUDES OF A HUNDRED TEENS AND TEACHERS PER MINUTE THAT I'M NOT A SUITABLE SERVANT TO YOUR BECK AND CALL. I DO WHAT I ... CAN. I'M NOT COX SITTING UP HERE STEALING COMPUTERS FROM THE SCHOOL LAB OR BENDER FLIRTING WITH TEENAGE GIRLS. I'M DUN. I'M THE LAST OF THE GOOD GUYS WEARING A UNIFORM AND GREETING THE KIDS WITH A SMILE WHEN THEY ENTER THE BUILDING. I TRY TO MAKE A SUNNY DAY OUT OF ..., AND I ANSWER EVERY CALL I GET AT THE SECURITY DESK. I DO MY JOB, DAMN IT, AND THIS TIME, LAURIE, MAYBE THE JOB GOT THE BETTER OF YOU. THAT ... HAPPENS, BUT DON'T GO BRINGING ME DOWN WITH YOU. YOU GET IN TROUBLE, YOU GET EARLY RETIREMENT. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I GET? I DO MY DAMN JOB. WELL, ... THIS JOB! I GAVE MY LIFE TO THIS PLACE, MY ENTIRE ... LIFE! [EXHALES] LOOK. SORRY. IT'S NOT JUST LAURIE. THESE BOYS FIGHT ALL THE TIME, AND I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING-
- TALKING TO THEIR PARENTS, SPLITTING THEM UP ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM. I'VE EVEN TRIED TO STOP IT MYSELF. WE'VE ALL TRIED. YOU CAN'T STOP IT. DON'T TELL ME THAT. HOW YOU GONNA STOP IT IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE SOURCE? SUPPOSED TO KNOW A MILLION AND ONE SOURCES? YOU GOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY CARRY IN THEM. THE RESENTMENT AND THE RAGE, THERE'S A LEGACY IN THAT. SOURCE OF THOSE FIGHTS IS OLDER THAN THE BRICKS OF THIS BUILDING, BUT NOBODY'S DOING THEIR RESEARCH. YOU GOT A BUNCH OF PARENTS, TEACHERS, POLITICIANS, WHOEVER TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THESE KIDS.

YOU REALLY WANT TO ASK ME THAT? I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IF I SAY NO. SOMETIMES I WANT TO GRAB YOU BY YOUR THROAT AND CHOKE THE ... OUT OF YOU. WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? WITNESSES. I WAS SITTING IN CLASS LISTENING TO THE LESSON... WAS GONNA BE A SILENT OBSERVER, WAS TALKING ABOUT NATIVE SON. I HAD WOKE UP THAT DAY THINKING ABOUT YOU, HADN'T SEEN NOR TALKED TO YOU IN WEEKS, BUT THE CHECK CAME ON TIME. I WOKE UP WITH THAT CHECK IN MY HANDS, AND I HAD A FEELING ABOUT THAT, LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, BUT I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU. I CALLED YOU, BUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER, SO I WENT TO CLASS, SITTING THERE LISTENING TO THE CLASS TALK ABOUT NATIVE SON, ABOUT THE CHARACTER BIGGER THOMAS AND WHO HE WAS AND WHAT LED HIM TO HIS ACT OF RAGE. TEACHER KEPT SAYING HE WAS UNLEASHED. I KEPT THINKING, ANIMAL, AND WE DISCUSSING THIS BIGGER THOMAS, DISCUSSING HIS CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHAT HE COMES FROM AND THIS AND THAT. SINGLE MOTHER, THAT GOT BROUGHT UP. ONE OF THE STUDENTS SAID HE ONLY HAD HIS MOTHER. AND I'M SITTING THERE LISTENING TO THIS ON A DAY WHERE I WOKE UP WITH YOU ON MY MIND AND TRIED TO CALL YOU, TELL YOU I HAD THIS FEELING ABOUT GETTING THESE CHECKS, TELL YOU I HADN'T SEEN YOU IN A MINUTE, WONDER WHERE YOU BEEN, BUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR PHONE, SO I SAT THERE LISTENING TO SINGLE-MOTHER, POOR, ANGRY, ANIMAL BIGGER THOMAS. AND WHEN THE TEACHER COME ASKING ME WHAT I THOUGHT, I FELT LIKE HE WAS SAYING SOMETHING TO ME, LIKE HE KNEW I WAS SITTING THERE THINKING ABOUT YOU, FEELING SINGLE-MOTHER, POOR, ANGRY ANIMAL BIGGER THOMAS-LIKE. AND HE STARTS SAYING, MR. JOSEPH, WHAT MADE BIGGER THOMAS DO THAT TO THAT GIRL? WHAT WERE HIS SOCIAL LIMITATIONS? WHAT MADE THE ANIMAL IN HIM EXPLODE? AND HE LOOKING AT ME BUT ALSO THROUGH ME, AND I SAY, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS YOU AND HOW I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU IN WEEKS BUT I GET THIS CHECK ON TIME, LIKE IT'S AUTOMATED, LIKE THE BANK SENDS IT TO ME, AND I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU EVEN MAIL IT. LIKE, IS IT EVEN PERSONAL, OR IS IT JUST ROBOTIC, ROUTINE RESPONSIBILITY? AND I'M THINKING, WHO DOES THAT? WHAT KIND OF NIGGA JUST SENDS CHECKS AND CALLS THAT FATHERHOOD? AND WE TALKING, BIGGER THOMAS THIS, AND, SINGLE MOTHER THAT, AND LIMITATIONS AND ANIMALS EXPLODING, AND I SAY, DO NOT ... CALL ON ME. I DO NOT HAVE THE ANSWER, NO, AND HE KEEP PUSHING ME AND PUSHING ME, AND I STAND UP TO WALK OUT BECAUSE I FEEL THE ROOM GETTING SMALLER AND I'M BECOMING BIGGER THOMAS, EVEN WHEN I HATE THIS PART OF THE STORY, AND TEACHER GET IN MY WAY, TELLS ME TO SIT DOWN, GRABS ME LIKE YOU GRABBED MY ARM WHEN YOU TRY TO PLAY DADDY ALL OF A SUDDEN, AND I PUSHED THAT BITCH, THREW HIS ASS OFF OF ME AND INTO THE ... SMARTBOARD, THREW HIM LIKE HE WAS A MONKEY HANGING ON MY BACK, LIKE HE WAS YOU, AND I'M WISHING IT WAS YOU. I'M WISHING I COULD THROW HIM AGAIN, POUND HIS ... FACE INTO THE GROUND, RIP THAT CHECK UP, AND SAY, VOID, BUT IT WASN'T YOU. IT WASN'T YOU I PUSHED-
- IT WAS MY TEACHER-
- BUT I WISHED IT WAS YOU. NO, I WISHED IT WAS YOU SO BAD, I HAD TO PEE. ALMOST ... PEED ON MYSELF RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THE CLASS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS HATE OR LOVE OR SOMETHING ELSE I WAS FEELING, BUT I KNOW WHY BIGGER THOMAS DID WHAT HE DID, AND I HATE THAT I KNOW, BUT YOU I HATE MORE. YOU I HATE MOST OF ALL. YOU KNOW, SON, I-

- NEED SOME AIR--AND OFF. I'M STEPPING OFF. I NEED SOME AIR FROM ALL THIS. YOU DON'T WANT ME IN YOUR LIFE, AND I DON'T-
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT. I JUST WISH-
- BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. [MUSIC PLAYING] I WAS GONNA LEAVE YOU THIS LONG-ASS MESSAGE, BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU'LL EVEN GET IT. THEN IF YOU DO, I'M NOT SURE YOU'LL EVEN RESPOND BACK. I THINK IT'S OVER, AND IT KILLS ME IN A THOUSAND WAYS, NOT BECAUSE I'LL NEVER FIND LOVE AGAIN-
- I KNOW I'M YOUNG; I KNOW I'M CUTE, AND I'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE; THERE'S A LOT OF FISH IN THE SWIMMING POOL, WHATEVER-
- BUT I'M JUST SAD THAT THIS IS THE END OF AN ERA AND IT'S OVER BEFORE IT REALLY BEGAN. I DON'T THINK I GOT ENOUGH CHANCES TO ... UP AND GET MAD AT YOU AND YELL AND THEN MAKE UP. I HATE THAT. EVERY RELATIONSHIP DESERVES TO GO THROUGH ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU HAD SOMETHING-
- DEEP, UGLY, BEAUTIFUL. WHATEVER. WE DIDN'T GET TO GIVE ALL OUR ... A TRY, BUT FOR THE LITTLE PARTS WE DID HAVE, FOR THE PARTS THAT MADE ME WANT TO CUT A CHICK'S FACE FOR YOU TURNING YOUR HEAD IN HER DIRECTION, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THAT SPACE, FOR MAKING ME FEEL ROOM ENOUGH TO BE JEALOUS AND MAD OR WHATEVER BECAUSE I ALSO GOT TO SMACK YOU AND GET IT OUT, AND THAT MADE ME FREE ENOUGH TO TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU. I JUST REALLY, REALLY LOVE YOU, AND I HATE YOU FOR LEAVING ME HERE AND BREAKING IT OFF AND NOT KNOWING YOURSELF. I REALLY HATE YOU FOR BEING SO BEAUTIFUL AND CONFUSED... AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT COMING BACK HERE ANYMORE BECAUSE THIS PLACE CAN'T HOLD YOU. THIS PLACE CAN'T HOLD NONE OF US, FOR REAL, AND I GUESS I KIND OF DID LEAVE YOU A LONG-ASS MESSAGE, ANYWAY, BUT ..., YOU KNOW?

NERVOUS BREAKDOWNS, WHAT MOST FOLKS CALL IT. DOCTORS CALL IT A PANIC DISORDER. I CALL IT MY MOMENT OF REVELATION. I'M SORRY, MA. ALL MY SON'S LIFE, I THOUGHT THERE WAS SPACE FOR HIM-
- A LITTLE EDUCATION, OPPORTUNITY, HE'D BE COMPLETE. BUT, MEMBERS OF THE BOARD, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I MISCALCULATED. OMARI'S ACTIONS AREN'T HIS BAG ALONE. THEY'RE MINE, ALL OF OURS. WE DIDN'T CARVE OUT ENOUGH SPACE. HE DOESN'T BELONG ANYWHERE. THERE'S NO BLOCK, NO SCHOOL, NO LAND HE CAN TRAVEL WITHOUT BEING UNDER SUSPICION AND DOUBT, NO EMOTION HE CAN CARRY WITHOUT BEING SILENCED, DISCIPLINED. HE NEEDED MORE SPACE TO BE. CAROLINA, ON P.A.: WE REAL COOL, WE... I MESSED UP, MA. CAROLINA, ON P.A.: LEFT SCHOOL. WE... I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME, AND I AIN'T SURE WHAT IT IS. I WANT HIM TO BELONG.

SOMETIMES I LOOK INTO HIS FACE, I GET STUCK STARING AS IF I CAN SEE WHAT HE WILL BECOME, AND THE LONGER I LOOK, THE LONGER HIS LIFE WILL BE, AND I'LL WANT HIM TO FIND SPACE FOR HIS ANGER WHERE HE ISN'T QUELLED BUT PUT TO GOOD USE, WHERE HE ISN'T A PRODUCT OF BIAS OR LOW EXPECTATION... CAROLINA, ON P.A.: SING SIN. WE... AND I WANT HIM TO KNOW LOVE... THEY SEE ME AS A MONSTER. TO FEEL LOVE FROM ALL THE PLACES. ONLINE, I'M A MONSTER. PEOPLE MADE COMMENTS, SAY I SHOULD BE KICKED OUT, LOCKED UP... HE'S A MAN, YOUNG, STILL GROWING, NOT FULLY ANYTHING. LIKE I'M AN ANIMAL... HE'S NOT AN ANIMAL. LIKE THEY EXPECT I WOULD BE. YOU'RE NOT AN ANIMAL, NO MORE THAN THE REST OF US, AND IF SO, WE BUILT THE JUNGLE. I DISAPPOINT YOU. I DISAPPOINT YOU. I CAN DO BETTER. SO IF YOU PLEASE, LET ME TAKE HIM FROM HERE, FIND A DIFFERENT SCHOOL, RESET, TRY AGAIN, BUT PLEASE DON'T-
- DON'T PRESS CHARGES. DON'T LOCK AWAY WHAT HOPES HE CAN BECOME. HIS RAGE IS NOT HIS SIN. IT WAS NEVER HIS SIN. IT'S HIS INHERITANCE... I KNOW I CAN DO BETTER. AND I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TO SAY THAT I TAKE THE BLAME. IT'S ME. SEND ME AWAY-
- PUNISH ME--BUT MY SON-
- NOT MY SON... CAROLINA, ON P.A.: WE DIE SOON. NOT MY SON. I'VE BEEN THINKING, MA, ABOUT INSTRUCTIONS, ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID. YEAH? I WROTE THEM DOWN. INSTRUCTIONS? YEAH. FOR ME? FOR EVERYBODY.

As umpire this year, I'd like a nice clean race. -Unlike last year. -I think you'll find that we beat you fair and square last year. Only on a technicality, after a rather protracted appeal. Not so square and fair. Well, I don't make the rules. I just know them better than anyone else, apparently. Really? What's rule 20, then? All gigs must complete races by following the course as instructed. Actually, you're wrong. Nope, you're right. Hold up! I think we're definitely getting better. Huh! That's debatable. Good morning. Good morning. Looking good. Thank you. Hm. Come on then. Let's go. -They look properly confident. -'Course they're confident. They've won four in a row. Well, Ellie, like I always say, it's what you do today that counts, not yesterday. All we need to do is follow Eric's lead. He's in the stroke position, he's setting the rhythm. I think we've got a real chance. -Argh! -Ooh! -Dad? -I'm okay, I'm okay. -Move the boat! -All right. Move the boat. Keep moving her forwards. Good one, Pippa. You just crocked our best rower. It weren't my fault. What's happened? Is it your hand? -My finger. -Oh, man up! I'm sure its not as bad as you think. I'll head up to the doc's, see if he can fix it. Ellie, you'll need to cover for me at the fish stall. What? I didn't even wanna do this in the first place. -All your idea. -Ellie! And now I've got to work at the stall and wear that stupid hat and stink of fish? I'm in a lot of pain right now. So, please, open up the fish stall. What's wrong with your leg? Not that there's anything wrong with your legs. It's an old training injury. It's what they call dedication. Dedication looks pretty painful. So I'll see you at the garage at five. I'm so sorry I can't meet for lunch. Bye, sweetie. I'm sorry, I'm late. -Bye. -Morwenna, stop messing around with boats and go and open the surgery. Well, I need to go get changed. Doc, a minute of your time. This is Dr. Ellingham. He'll have a look at your legs--leg. Yes, it's actually-
- it's quite painful now, so-
- If you want a consultation, make an appointment. Well, you could just tell me what it is. It's a leg, if you want me to diagnose your condition, make an appointment and come to the surgery. It's a leg! Al! Al! A little bit of help. I'm very busy, Dad. Al! Al... -What is it? -I'm in agony up here. Right. Okay! Oi. You took your time. I'm packing cases. -What's happened? -It's my foot. You've got to get me up the hill to see the doctor. What, now? No, no, not if it's inconvenient. I'm about to pass out 'cause of the excruciating pain that is throbbing through my toe. But if you'd rather wait, you know, have a bit of breakfast, read the paper. Would you take James, please? What's wrong with your arm? Nothing, it's just a rash. -Let me see. -It came up overnight. -Looks like lichen planus. -What's that, then? -Is it contagious? -No, come to the surgery. I'll prescribe you something for it, but don't scratch it! You'll make it worse. Goodbye, James. Have a good day. Ohh! Ooh! You all right? Don't make a fuss, Doc. I've got to get to work. Just tripped on the last step. Ignore him, Doc. He's got two left feet. It's all right, Doc says it's not contagious. How's the leg? I thought it'd be better by now. Ooh! -The size of that lump! -Oh. It wasn't as big as that this morning. Maybe I should go and see that doctor of yours. I strongly advise you do. As umpire, I have discretion to decide if people are physically fit for the competition or not. -Also, that looks terrifying. -Yes, fine, I'll go see that Dr. Ellington after practice. -Ellingham. -What? It's Dr. Ellingham. -Gham. -Right. It's up there. Just tell him Joe Penhale sent you. -He'll know what you mean. -Oh, right. So he'll see me quicker if I mention your name? Probably not, no. So why did you bring this up? You were trying to impress me. -Did it impress you? -No. -Think you can fix it? -It's not broken. It's dislocated. Look that way. Argh! Bit of warning next time, Doc. -You feel that? -Yeah. Good, I'll need to splint that and bandage it. How long will that be for? Come back and see me in three days, but it will need to stay bound for at least two weeks. No, no, no, Doc, we've got the race. No, you're not racing. There's got to be a way. I've convinced my Ellie to get involved. Spends most of her time on her bloody phone. She's gonna be pretty annoyed if she has to row without me. Can't you just give it an injection or something? You need to rest your hand to avoid doing further and more serious damage to yourself. -This is important. -No, it's not. It's a boat race. -So? -Sorry, Morwenna. Oh, Doc, wasn't there anything else you could do? No, there wasn't. Doc, can you help me here? -Yes, go through. -Oh, thanks. You know if I could race, I would. Where am I gonna find somebody last minute to take your place? Oh, no, no, I mean, I wish I could, I really do but I need to look after the pub tomorrow, especially as Dad's not so well. Oh, cheers. -It's gout. -Gout? But I don't drink port, Doc. Gout's got nothing to do with port. Babies get gout. There's often a genetic predisposition towards a high level of uric acid in the blood. Well, that's very interesting, Doc, but I'm in agony here. Yes, I'll prescribe you naproxen to dull the pain and also test your blood to see if you'd benefit from allopurinol, but that's a long-term solution. I just need to get back on my feet so I can help Al. Isn't there some quick fix you can give me? No, it doesn't work like that. Keep your foot raised for a week, put an ice-pack on your toe, and drink plenty of water. Well, if you can't help me, can you think of anyone else who can? Well, you used to row, didn't you, Mr. Cleveland? I did, yes. In fact, I rowed alongside your grandfather, Morwenna. Really? I didn't know that. Before your time, of course. If you're in a real bind I suppose I could get into the boat again and-
- You're all right, Mr. C. I'm sure we'll find someone. Thanks though. Oh. All right, Alice? I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Ellington. Oh, it's Ellingham, Ellingham. Yeah, Ellingham. I should be able to squeeze you in in about an hour. -Is there nothing earlier? -I'm in no rush. She can--she can go before me. Oh. I hear you're a man down. I do hope you find someone. Won't be much of a contest otherwise. -Mind you. -Yeah, maybe this year will be different, eh? Take a seat. Maybe. -Everything okay, Dad? -I've got gout, boy. I've got to put my leg up for a week. -What about the pub? -I'm the invalid here. -Next patient? -Alice Taylor. She's from Port Carran, but I'll register her as a temporary patient. -Yes. Come through. -Thanks. -Morning, Bert. -Hello, Janet. -What, a whole week? -Well, I could try and get up for lunch and dinner, but how about breakfast in bed, eh? [Music] We'll man all the boats and we'll head out to sea [Music] [Music] Wey, hey, blow the man down [Music] Um... [Music] Out on the waves now, so wild and so free [Music] [Music] Whoa, give me some time to blow the man down [Music] I've got something to tell you. I've made a big decision. You're leaving Martin? No! I've decided to give in my notice. -I think. -You think? Well, I was sure, but it's easy to say it, and it's harder to actually do it. And I'll miss the kids and the school and 
- -That must be so tough. -Mm. If you did leave, do you think I'd get your job? I've no idea. No, of course. You could write me a reference though, if you wanted. -No pressure. -Pippa. [Music] Whoa, give me some time to blow the man down [Music][Music] It's fine. I think it'll be good on the actual day. They just need to learn their lines. It's been hurting for a while. My GP had a look, but it's just blown up. Mm, it's a Baker's cyst. They can come up very quickly. -Well, it sounds manageable. -No. It needs to be dealt with. If it bursts, which it looks like it could at any moment, and the fluid leaks into your calf, then the pain will be excruciating. Well, if you deal with it, I'll be able to row tomorrow, yes? Yes, I'll draw out the fluid and put a dressing on it for you. So will you cut it open? No, I'll insert a needle and draw it out with a syringe. No, I have this--I have this thing with needles. It's the only way, you won't feel anything. No, I had a terrible experience with needles as a child. I had jaundice. A lot of blood was taken. It was very painful. Right, well, that's understandable. No, if you stick a needle in me, I might throw up. My GP normally gives me lorazepam, a sedative. I don't prescribe unnecessary medicines. Does your watch have a second hand? -Yes. -Good. Lie down and look at your watch and count the seconds out loud. Come on. Right, this is just a local anesthetic. -What's that for? -In case you vomit. -Oh, no, no, no, no. -What are you doing? -Get that thing away from me! -Come on, don't be silly. -Come on. -Oh, God! Oh. Wake up! Doc! You okay? Stop hitting me. Oh, God, is she still bleeding? -Everything okay? -What? Get out! Go on. Morwenna, I need plasters and butterfly stitches. All right. You know you were both unconscious? On the floor? What, he passed out too? Why did you pass out? I hate needles. What have I done to my head? You must have hit it when you fell. Oh! I told you. You didn't listen. Now look at me. I have a cup to win tomorrow. No. You should stay at home. You're not fit to practice. You are a liability. Just go home and get some rest. No. The way you've treated me is disgraceful. What do you mean, I've drained your cyst and I've dressed your head wound. What, the head wound inflicted by you. -Don't be absurd. -Okay. Do you want me to call you a taxi? No, I can-
- I can walk. Lying on the floor, both of them. -What, seriously? -Yeah. Yes? Do you want me to cancel your patients? Why would I do that? Well, in case you're, you know, not feeling well. No, I'm fine. Thank you. Show them in. All right, um--oh. Mel's here. She's a bit early but she's got to go. Yes, come through. Take a seat. Thank you. Show me your wrist. Are you all right? I heard you fainted. It's lichen planus. Nobody knows where it comes from, and there's nothing you could have done to prevent it. I'll prescribe you a corticosteroid cream to soothe the irritation. Do you wash yourself with soap? Of course, there's nothing wrong with my hygiene. The soap will be drying your skin out, increasing the itching. From now on, just wash with water but do keep washing. Will it go away? It should do. Between six and nine months. What's wrong with your arm? Oh, Graham fell over and knocked into it. -Who's Graham? -Graham. My husband Graham. You met him this morning. Oh. Does he fall over a lot? Sometimes. Do you think he has a problem with alcohol? No! He has the occasional beer, very occasional, but I'd know if there was a problem. -Well, you might not. -Are you saying -he's lying to me? -I'm not saying anything. Just get him to come and see me. -He wouldn't come here. -Why not? Just ask him. You're very abrasive. I'm sure he'd do what you said. Yes. Right. Thanks. Any luck? No. Half the village don't want to row 'cause they think we're gonna lose, and the other half are physically incapable. Put me in the second camp. I have every faith in your ability. Chippy said you'd put Port Carran down as odds-on favorites to win. I'm in a lot of pain and wish to be left alone. Now. Come on, Al. Please. Oh, last time I got in a boat, I smashed a woman in the face with the oar and burst her nose open. -I remember that. -It was an accident. Morwenna, I'd love to help but I've got this place, so... The pub is gonna open later now. I promised Louisa I'd go up to the school and help sell tickets and programs. That is very kind of you, Bert. Doing something for the good of the village. If only there were more people like you about. If I don't say yes, you're gonna keep asking me -and asking me, aren't you? -No, no, no. If you're too scared to get in a boat, that's no problem at all. I'm not scared. I'm not. Okay. I'll row. Yeah. Hm. Yes? Hello, uh, I'd like some paracetamol, please. Oh, dear. What's happened to you? I passed out in the doctor's surgery. Oh. That doctor passed out too. It was quite the scene. What? Is he all right? He's fine. Something to do with seeing my blood all over the floor. Oh, yes, he's a martyr. Oh, really? In what way? Oh, it's an affliction, a phobia. He's had it ever since he came here. Before he came here. Actually why he had to leave London. And he fights through it, each and every day. Thank you. You've been very helpful. 45p, please. Thank you. But why do you think you fainted? I don't know. Has your blood phobia got worse? No, I don't think so. I thought you had it under control. Yes, I do have it under control. Look, I thought we were looking for a car. What about this one? This one's practical. No. Louisa, Doc. -Hello, there. -I like this one. Oh, it's cheap to run. You can park it anywhere. You can take it for a test drive, if you like. You're slurring your words. -Have you been drinking? -Absolutely not. Have you been talking to my wife? Martin. Yes, I'd love to take it for a test drive. -That would be great. -I shall get the keys. -This one? -Mm. I think it's fun. Fun? -It's very small, isn't it? -Mm. Where would you put the child seat? It's fine. I can put it in the front. -Where would I sit? -Well, it's not really meant for family outings. It's just to help me get to and from college. Yes, change out of third now. Yeah, I know what I'm doing. It's been a long time since you drove. Martin, shush. Oh, by the way, are you coming up to the school -to watch the race tomorrow? -I hadn't planned to. You know it'll be my last time doing the performance. It would mean a lot if you were there. Mirror. Have you handed in your letter of resignation? -Mm. Mostly. -What do you mean? I mean I've written the letter. I just haven't officially passed it over yet, as it were. -I don't know what that means. -It means I haven't -handed it in yet. -Why not? Because, Martin, I haven't. Can you just let me concentrate on the road, please? -Very close on this side. -Yes. -And slowly round the corners. -Yes. I have actually driven a car before. Not this one. What were you thinking, running your mouth off in front of the doc and everyone? Because I'm worried about you. A couple of times a week, you're completely sozzled. I am not. Why can't you trust me? I'm not stupid, you know. You should go and see him. -Right, so how did we find it? -Yeah, I like it. Well, obviously we're going to look at other cars. No, no, I'm going to buy it. Well, I'll get the paperwork organized, give the car a once-over, and we can drop it off tomorrow, then. Thank you. What? It's my money, Martin. Yes, I understand that, but... But what? -But nothing. -It's a nice car. It's a good decision. Doc, sorry it's late, but you did say if Graham wanted to talk. Yes, come in. So, we had a talk, and he still says he's not drinking. -I'm not! -Well, something's going on, isn't it? Well, that's why I've come here, Doc. You see, some nights I'm swaying all over the place and the next day I feel awful. I'm--I'm worried that it might be... might be Parkinson's. What makes you think that? Well, I was looking it up and I've got the same symptoms. Really? Do you have any of the following: tremors or stiffness, sight problems, cramps, difficulty swallowing, dribbling? Sometimes I have stomach cramps. -Not the others? -No. It's not Parkinson's. -Diet? -Uh, no, not me. -What is your diet? -Oh, um, a bit of cheese, bit of bread, chicken. Mel here cooks up a lot of pies, like shepherd's, cottage, fish. Stop talking. I need you to blow into this. This will indicate any alcohol on your breath. Well, you're wasting your time there, Doc, 'cause I know for sure that I don't. Let me see. Well, this says that you do. The equivalent of two or three glasses of wine. -Or cider. -Something you want to tell me, Graham? -It can't be right. -It's a medical fact. Or are you gonna argue with facts now? I'll take a blood sample. Measure the alcohol in that. Don't pass out, Doc. I just--I just don't understand it, Doc. I mean, I don't even remember the last time I had a drink, it were that long ago. Well, you have been stressed at work. If you tell me the truth, Graham, right now, I promise I won't be mad. -I am telling the truth. -Oh, for goodness sake. Until I get your blood sample results back, you can't drive. I've got to deliver Louisa's car. I can do that. You wait for me outside. I just need a minute to talk to the doc about that rash of mine. So? I told you before, it's lichen planus. No, not about me! Graham! He's got a lot of faults, Doc, but being a liar's not one of 'em. -At least, I didn't think so. -Well, if he is an alcoholic, they can often be very secretive about their drinking. See if you can find some evidence. I'll watch him like a hawk, Doc. Yes. -Good morning, Constable. -Oh! Oh, sorry, did I scare you? No, not at all. It's just I'm trained to react so it could have been dangerous. -Right. -Shouldn't really creep up -on me like that. -Well, I hope you're not -sabotaging our gig. -Just measuring the boat. As umpire, I take my impartiality very seriously. Ms. Taylor, are you sure you're feeling well enough to compete? -What? -Did the doc say -you're okay to race? -Yes, fine. It was just a cyst. He jabbed it with a needle, drained it, then collapsed. Any other questions? I was meant to get married this year, but my wife more or less left me at the altar. What was meant to be the greatest day of my life turned out to be the worst. And? Sometimes we think we're doing well when actually we're not, but we're so determined to make things right, we don't notice. Yeah, well, thank you for being so considerate. -Sorry you got jilted. -It's okay. But the only thing that matters is that we won last year. And the year before. And we will win this year again. Have you never heard of the expression, It's not the winning that counts, it's the taking part? Yes, but only by the people who don't win. Excuse me. You can take them down to the fundraiser at the end of the day, but don't forget to put their reins on, -all right? -Okay. -Really? -Just checking. You've been checking on me all night and all morning. Even got up in the middle of the night when I went to the bloody bathroom. That was an accident. -Don't leave stuff in the boat. -I didn't mean to. Hold it! Okay, keep it level while we just do final checks. They look so much better than us. It's not about how they look. It's about what they do. You mean like winning four years in a row? All right! But we've got something they haven't. -Oh, please don't say heart. -No, I wasn't gonna say that. It's been ages since Portwenn tasted victory. And last year we came so close only for Port Carran to rob us of that trophy. But this year, we're taking it back. Because today, today is our day for glory! That's when you're meant to start clapping and cheering, guys. Oh, God. Who gave him that? Oh, here we go. Right, listen up, everyone. Gather 'round. Come on, yep. I want you to get into your gigs and go to the starting line. The bull horn will signal the start of the race. I want you to row out, around the buoy and then back again. The first team to cross the finishing line will be the winner. May the best team win. Good luck, Portwenn. I hope they drown. Let's get this over with. Oi, oi, oi! Here's your program and ticket. Would you like to place a bet on the winner of the race? Is that for charity as well? Only if you bet on Portwenn. No, thank you. So, here we are, ladies and gentlemen. Make sure you stop by a stall. Don't want any stingy people here. There's the raffle, if you fancy your chances. I've bought 20 tickets, so better win something this year. Louisa? Oh, very nautical. I just thought I'd make an effort. Here. Let me. -Thank you. -Is Martin here? I wanted to have a word with him. He's most likely holed up in the surgery avoiding people. I had asked him to come down as it's probably gonna be my last fundraiser, but you know Martin. Sorry, excuse me, Ruth. David, you're late, where's your costume? -Yes, well, go on. -There's Mrs. Thompson's famous sponge cake. Probably the only thing around here that doesn't float. Right? No. To be fair, Mrs. Thompson, with all you've gone through, I'm amazed you even get up in the morning, let alone bake a cake. So, Morwenna used to have a fear of rowing, but fortunately that ship has sailed. Martin, are you here? Ruth. I heard about your fainting. Why didn't you come and see me about it? -It was a one-off. -Well, everything is a one-off until it happens again. And what does Louisa mean when she says this is her last fundraiser? She's stopping teaching. She's going to concentrate on her course -full-time now. -Oh, good. -And that's fine with you? -Yes. Yes, we've discussed it. It's a good decision. But why are you hiding here, then, when she wants you to join her up at the fundraiser? -I'm not hiding. -Oh, good. Then you can walk me back up there. -Come on. -Yes. You do realize there'll be children singing and the whole thing will be ghastly, don't you? Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Um, a slice of the sponge, please, a large one. Okay, that's £2.50. -Mel. -Ooh, I didn't realize it was fancy dress. Well, it's not really, you know. How's James? When are they coming down? The little 'uns are all up at the nursery. They're bringing them down at the end of the day. Yes, it's best when it's a bit quieter, I think. And one of these for my little friend here. Right, everyone pay attention to me! Everyone looking at me! Everyone! Right, the race is about to start. Rowers, are you ready? Three, two, one... And they're off! And we're off to a good start. The boats will head out around the buoy and then they'll disappear for a while, which, to be honest, is pretty boring. So, in the meantime, the children are gonna perform for us. Let's hope it's not quite so boring. I'm sure it won't, fingers crossed. A long time ago, the Cornish gig was a work boat, taking pilots out to ships in the stormy Atlantic. They would race to get jobs and argued about which village had the fastest boats. Which is why, for years and years, Portwenn and Port Carran have battled it out for the annual Gig Cup. [Music] We'll man all our boats and we'll head out to sea [Music] [Music] Wey, hey, blow the man down [Music] [Music] Whoa! Give me some time to blow the man down [Music] -Blow the man down! -Be quiet! Oi, keep it down, eh? Might want to go easy on the beer as well. -I'm not drinking! -Sound like you have to me. He hasn't. I've been watching him all day. Mel, he does seem a little worse for wear. Louisa, I swear, if he'd been drinking, I'd know about it. Why don't you just take him home? Really. Graham. Graham? [Music] Whoa! [Music] [Music] Give me some time to blow the man down [Music][Music] Thank you very much to the children of Portwenn School there. Not that boring after all. Five, six. Seven, eight! Come on, put your backs into it! -Oh! -Oh, Al! We're losing ground! Come on! -Sorry, it was an accident. -Absolutely useless! I told you I was rubbish at rowing. No domestics! Get back to work! One, two, three. Come on! Four, five, six. -Round the mark! -Come on. -Round the mark! -Here they come, around the buoy! Portwenn have got it all to do as Port Carran open up a lead! The race is definitely in Port Carran's favor. Not saying we'll need a miracle to catch up, but I'd start praying now. Oh, no, here's Portwenn, coming up slowly. But you know what they say: Slowly, slowly, catchy boaty. Oh, do they? Um, hello. Can you all hear me? I just wanted to, well, to thank you all for coming, really, and to say how much we appreciate your continued support, year after year. Uh, Louisa, this isn't on the schedule. Yeah, just a minute, Joe. I remember when I first saw this race as a child, and then later as a teacher and now, as headmistress. And it's always been my favorite day of the school year. Although I've secretly always wanted to join the fishermen's choir! But now at least today I finally get to wear the outfit! Which is fitting as this year is gonna be my last year here at Portwenn school. -Hey! -Do you mind? ...trying to decide, and even this morning, I wasn't sure if I could go through with this. I know it's been a difficult decision as it's been such a privilege getting to know your children and watching them grow and making their brave new steps into the world. Look out! Agh! Well, I think it's time for me to do the same. Don't go anywhere. Oh, Joe. -Not you. -Oh, right. Right, move. -Out of my way. -So... -Out of the way. -What I've learnt from all of you parents and children is-
- is that... Don't worry, I'll put it all in the newsletter. -Got a situation here, Doc. -Hang on a minute! I'm the one in pain here. The car almost went over my foot. I told you to get some rest and stay at home, and I told you to stop driving. I have not been drinking. He's clearly under the influence. I'm gonna get my breathalyzer. Doc, I have followed him all night, all day. He hasn't blinked without me seeing it. I've tasted every drink he's had. I won't even let him go to the bathroom alone. -It's driving me crazy. -He cannot have been drinking. Exactly. Well, his blood test showed the presence of alcohol, but if you're absolutely certain, there might be another explanation. I need you to blow into this until I tell you to stop. Uh, no, don't bother. He'd probably fail it, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's been drinking. You could have auto-brewery syndrome. I've never actually come across it myself, but fermentation in the gut leads to ethanol production. -Say again. -You'd have to undergo monitored tests in hospital, but if they confirm the presence of too much yeast inside you, and you haven't been drinking, then your body may well be brewing its own alcohol supply in your stomach. So what you're saying is, basically my body is a brewery? Yes, that's exactly what I am saying. Thanks, Doc. Come and see me tomorrow. Thank you. -Come on. -Is that my car? Oh, don't worry about it, Louisa. I'll send one of the boys down to fix it and then I'll deliver it to you tomorrow, promise. Oh, she will. -She's just amazing. -Oh! Oh, God, you smell terrible but you do talk lovely. So you're saying he's not been drinking -but he's drunk. -Yes. I need more information. It's the gastrointestinal organism saccharomyces cerevisiae. It's been identified as a yeast pathogen. That's too much information. Oh! The boats. Ease off both sides! One, two, three, four. On two! Give me a big ten! One, two, three, four. Come on! -Yes! -Come on, we're doing well. -Come on. -Come on! Nine, ten. Alice! Hang on! Stop rowing, stop rowing. -Man down! -Here, lift her up. -Come on! -Come on! Mor, I think something's happened. -Ignore them! -What, seriously? Guys, I think that girl Alice has collapsed. -Steady her. -Quickly, pull them in. -What? -Plenty of wellie. -Maybe we should stop. -We're winning! They wouldn't turn 'round for us. Come on, Morwenna! Yeah, Mor. And Portwenn are in the lead! We are watching history in the making here. -Come on! -No. Turn around. -We're helping. -Yeah. -Head to their boat! -Around! Starboard! Port! I mean port! Over there! Over there! But now they are going backwards. Why are they going backwards? Oh. There's a man down in the Port Carran team. Or should I say, woman down? Yes, I should. It's a woman. Doc, it's an emergency. -Hold up. -No, bring her 'round. Throw us a rope and we'll tow you in! Put her down here. -Is she breathing? -I don't know. Hello. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Hello. Not you. -Don't you touch me! -What's wrong with her, Doc? I think she's got a delayed concussion. Concussion? Because of yesterday, what you did to me? No, because you ignored my instruction to go to bed and rest. I don't want to hear any more from you. -Linda, Michelle, help me up. -Look, you really need to let me examine you properly. -No! -All right. Well, take her to a hospital and make sure she gets a CT scan. Go away! I can't talk to you. Listen up! Seeing as the Port Carran team have walked away without acknowledging me, I am disqualifying them for flagrant disregard of the umpire. -That seems a bit harsh, Joe. -Shush, Morwenna. -He's saying we've won. -Yeah, but we don't want to just win by default. Maybe Dad'll be so happy he'll let me off fish duty. No, no, no, no, no, you can't do this. I'm the umpire. I can do that. Then I would like to make a formal protest. Dad, you're only protesting 'cause you're gonna lose -a lot of money on this. -'Cause I believe in proper rules and regulations. Otherwise it's just anarchy. My official decision is victory to Portwenn. Morwenna, as team captain, do you formally accept? Yeah, I suppose so. Portwenn it is. I put 30 quid on Portwenn. I'm gonna get my Ellie something nice. Time to pay up. I wish I had your luck, Eric. -I want my money too. -Come on! -No, no. -You need someone to look after you. Shift! Out of the way! Shift! Then I told everyone I was leaving, so there's no going back now. Well, that's good. That's good, isn't it? And you're still sure you've made the right decision? It's a bit late to ask that now, isn't it? No, of course I'm not sure. But that's what makes it exciting, I suppose. You know, the risk. I mean, yes, I'd be worried if you decided to stop being a doctor. But things don't have to stay the same forever, do they? Do you think your fainting had anything to do with my circumstances changing? No, I don't think so. Yes, 'cause you do like a controlled environment, -don't you? -Louisa, you've only just started this course. Please don't use me as a test case. I'm simply gathering a picture of your symptoms, Martin, that's all. -Hello. -Hi, Chris. -Did you come for the race? -What? Oh, no, no, no, I missed all that. Actually, I'm-
- I'm here on business. Look, perhaps we could have a talk in private somewhere, hm? Sure, yeah, you carry on. I've got to get this little one some food. Come in for a cup of tea before you go. -Please. -Oh, right. -What is it? -Um, yes. Uh, right, well, to the point. Um, I'm afraid you're in trouble, Martin. There's a patient. I tried to talk to her, I tried to persuade her not to make a complaint, but she'd already got the powers that be involved. Martin, she wants you struck off. -She being? -Alice Taylor. I believe you drained her cyst? Her Baker's cyst, yes. I treated her successfully. But the patient passed out and she's claiming you did as well. Is that--is that true? Normally, I could make this disappear. But it seems Alice Taylor is a solicitor. She made an almighty fuss, which is how she's got this moving so quickly. What exactly is she saying? You're accused of being too ill to work safely. Look, it could be serious. If your phobia is out of control and you really can't cope-
- No, nothing is out of control. The woman was suffering from concussion. She didn't know what she was saying. She wouldn't let me help her when she collapsed on her boat. Well, she collapsed again and you tried to help her? Yes, of course I did, that's what I do, -I'm a doctor. -Well, you need to stay away from her till this is sorted out. -I certainly will. -In fact, you need to stay away from all patients. What do you mean? Martin. I hate to do this, but until this complaint's been dealt with you need to stop practicing. Are you suspending me? No, I'm advising you. Close the surgery until further notice. I'll call you tomorrow. Sorry. Action! Hello. How was the emergency? Some stupid fisherman caught his hand in a winch. Everything was shot on film when we started doing this and we always got lots of compliments about how it looked. -So we don't need the dog? -No, no, we're having the dog. Quite Luddite, really, but that's how I learned and that's how we've always done it. And I love film, I love the discipline of it. Most of the crew love working on it. <i> Doc Martin</i> is a sort of place which is a bit lost in time. Film gives it a lovely storytelling, slightly warm period feel. The test is whether somebody's eye looks like it's made of jelly... Duck. Say, Duck. ...which it always does on film. It just has a texture that you have to add to digital to get, and when we make our documentaries about animals and things, we usually pepper them with some footage of just actuality of just the animal, which we shoot on Super 16 film. And when people come at the end and say, I love the photography in that, but that shot of that horse in the water and that dingo on the beach, and it's the bits that are shot on film that seem to speak to them. We're using 35-mil camera lenses which are what we call prime lenses. They're not a zoom lens, so you choose your length of lens for the size of shot and you stick with that, and the only way of changing that is to move the camera towards the artists or the artists towards the camera. There's a lovely depth of field which means the background is slightly soft focus, it's got a lovely warmth to it. It's only his first word. It's not a big deal, really. Portwenn, or Port Isaac, as it really is, is like a character in the story. It's a huge part of it. It's the whole canvas. With each director, you get a different view of Port Isaac and you just get a slightly different slant on it. I love seeing it sort of reinvented. We've always believed that if you're going to take a picture, take a nice one. And it just adds so much to every scene that we write, because you have this beautiful backdrop. And lots more drones on<i> Doc Martin.</i> Yes. Got me kicking and screaming into the 21st century, 'cause last series, I was really anti them. It's nice, you know, we get different angles, and as long as it tells the story rather than just have a pretty shot. Tipping up, going up. And down maybe. We're based on a beautiful Cornish farm... ...which is right by the North Cornish Coast facing the Atlantic, with rolling hills. It's a working farm. It's arable and beef cattle. The producer and directors and anybody else, really, who wants to come and check anything out can just walk up to the cutting room. We're only 30 seconds away from where the interior sets are. So, people can come if they want to see a shot, if they want to see anything for continuity. It's so easy for everybody to be on location. It's just fantastic having the editors on-site. So, I can go into the edit suite, I can edit the episodes, get them up to London, get them locked while we're still filming, and also we can see at a glance if we need a pick-up shot, if we need to reshoot anything. It just works fantastically and all the editors seem quite happy to be here. When we first started filming all those years ago, I used to go up to the edit suite and there would be wetsuits hanging outside, surfboards, and I thought, Okay, they got into the Cornish life here. Nick has been doing it from day one and, so, I guess he's had a hand in sort of inventing, you know, the editing style of it. At least we don't run the risk of drowning in the classroom. We'll make a sailor out of you yet. He so knows the tone of the show. It's how you cut out of a shot, how you link to another scene, um, and he's very, very clever with the way he does that. Oh, Miss, he's not feeling very well. Editing comedy is very delicate. Yeah, nobody panic! You just have to find that perfect rhythm that throws the audience off and then brings them back. It's always--there's always a sleight of hand with comedy. Will you look at this, and then you do something with this hand. Oh! Oh, no! It's a sort of comic timing. It's the way some people can tell jokes and other people can't. Go away! Disgusting. Sorry, Doc, I'll just be a minute. There's a beat where you cut to that reaction shot, and if you get it right, that's what makes it funny. I don't think I'll make it inside, Doc. No, just go! Oh, thank you! No, go inside! I love working on the show because I laugh when I'm cutting shots together. The actors on<i> Doc Martin</i> are amazing because they just put so much into it and they are so good at what they do. It is sunny all the time. It just, uh, well, it's tricky, actually. There's a few scenes where it's a bit cloudy and rainy, but we just have to have weather cover all the time, and this set here is our standing weather cover set. So we know if it's gonna be a horrible, rainy day and we re-jig and we come inside. Good morning, Doctor. Here are the notes for your first patient. Trevor Dodds! Who are you? This is Emily. She's covering for me for a few days, -remember? -No. We have ways of making it look sunny. We can color grade it, so if it's a bit gray and overcast, we can wind a bit of brightness in, make it a little bit warmer, a little bit of orange which looks like sunlight. Sound is crucial at making it flow. Sound and music is often forgotten about, but it's as important as anything else, and you can create the atmosphere of a scene with just a single sound effect. What we do in the dub is we take all the birds and seagulls off and then we add them all as sound effects. I'm going, Well, we've got them all! Colin Towns has been doing the music for a long time, and that's very much a part of the style of the show. The music is what brings it alive. The music is what cues you to feel stuff, and it just works so well. And we've got a great composer, and he--and usually, he writes new music for every single episode. He sits down and composes the score for each episode. That is a lot of whiskey. We have to hit absolute specific timing for our broadcasters. The scripts have to be an exact length. I'm the new curate. I didn't realize we were getting a woman. Three storylines that run through each script. What on earth are you doing with that dog? And to make sure that they're all tied up satisfactorily within the timeframe that we have while also hitting part breaks and stuff like that. It's quite a... Yeah, it's an interesting challenge. It can be incredibly painful. [Glasses clink] [People speaking indistinctly] Narrator: Whether you enjoy gulping them down by the dozen or eating them carefully with a fork, you can find oysters on menus all over town, but that wasn't always the case. Woman: I felt like every great city has its own little oyster bar, and there was really nothing in D.C. that matched that. And so, I wanted to create that here. My name is Jamie Leeds. I am the owner and restaurateur of Hank's Oyster Bar in Dupont Circle. Narrator: When Jamie opened the restaurant in 2005, she named it after her father. Leeds: My dad was an incredible guy. He was very happy, joyful, and loved food. We used to cook seafood together. He died when I was 11. When I decided to open Hank's, I thought, What a perfect name and a nice homage to him. [People speaking indistinctly] Not only do we buy from around the country, but we also have our own local oysters that you can only get here. Originally, one of the farmers just walked in and shucked his oysters right in front of me. I tasted it, and it was a great oyster. I said, OK, you're in. Woman: My first oyster was here. I used to put a little Tabasco and maybe a saltine cracker or something, but now I just shuck 'em and eat 'em. She doesn't like the cocktail sauce, so we get one side of horseradish and one with cocktail sauce and horseradish. Makes the relationship work. Ha ha! Bruce Springsteen: [Music] Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack... [Music] Narrator: Jamie's urban beach food menu includes more than just oysters. Leeds: We have a full seafood menu. I wanted to be able to offer a non-seafood option as well. Sunday night is fried chicken night. That's a big night. They've got the small plates, the large plates and specials, so I'm trying something new tonight, which is the salmon. Everything you get here is just amazing. so that's why I love this place so much. Springsteen: [Music] ...heart [Music] [Music] Everybody's got a...
