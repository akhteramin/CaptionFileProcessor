 GOOD MORNING.
 WELCOME TO GREAT DAY
 WASHINGTON.
  TODAY WE FEATURE A MAN WHO
 WENT FROM 400 POUNDS
 TO LOSING SO MUCH HE LANDED ON
 THE COVER OF WORLD'S
 RUNNER'S MAGAZINE.
  IT'S AN INSPIRING JOURNEY.
  AND IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT
 CAR SEAT SAFETY.
 WE HAVE HAD IT ALL IN THE NEWS.
 WE HAVE ALL THE CAR SAFETY THAT
 YOU NEED TO KNOW.
 THE COUNTRY THIS MORNING IS
 REACTING TO THE
 PRESIDENT'S SECOND STATE OF THE
 UNION ADDRESS AFTER
 LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT CALLED
 FOR AN END TO THE
 POLITICAL STALEMATE BETWEEN
 REPUBLICANS AND
 DEMOCRATS.
 MATT GREGORY HAS MORE.
 Reporter: HERE ARE THREE
 THINGS TO KNOW FROM
 THE STATE OF THE UNION AND THE
 DEMOCRAT'S RESPONSE.
 NUMBER ONE, THE PRESIDENT
 CALLED FOR CONGRESS TO
 PASS TIGHTER BORDER SECURITY
 MEASURES.
 THIS INCLUDED A CONTINUED CALL
 FOR A BORDER WALL
 BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
 MEXICO.
 NUMBER TWO, THE PRESIDENT
 REVEALED HE WILL HAVE
 ANOTHER MEETING WITH NORTH
 KOREA.
 THE SUMMIT WILL HAPPEN FEBRUARY
 27th AND 28th IN
 VIETNAM AND THE GOAL IS TO GET
 AN AGREEMENT FOR
 DENUCLEARIZATION.
 AND STACY ABHRA MS BLAMED THE
 PRESIDENT FOR THE
 COUNTRY BEING DIVIDED AND
 POINTED TO THE 35 DAY
 PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AS
 AN EXAMPLE OF HIS
 REFUSAL TO COMPROMISE AND HOW
 THAT HURT THE COUNTRY.
  AS MATT SAID ABHRAMS GAVE
 THE DEMOCRATIC
 RESPONSE AND BLAMED THE
 SHUTDOWN ON THE PRESIDENT.
  THE SHUTDOWN WAS A STUNT.
 ENGINEERED BY THE PRESIDENT OF
 THE UNITED STATES.
 ONE THAT ABANDONED OUR PEOPLE
 AND OUR VALUES.
  SHE SAID THOUGH SHE
 DISAGREES WITH THE PRESIDENT
 SHE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO FAIL.
 ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE
 CHAMBER FOR THE
 SPEECH WAS A WOMAN WE FIRST MET
 DURING THE SHUTDOWN.
 SHE IS A FEDERAL CONTRACTOR
 FURLOUGHED DURING THE
 SHUTDOWN.
 SHE AND OTHERS NEVER GOT BACK
 PAY.
 SHE ATTENDED THE ADDRESS AS A
 GUEST OF A
 CONGRESSWOMAN AND SHE HAD A
 MESSAGE FOR THE
 PRESIDENT.
  MR. TRUMP, PLEASE AT THIS
 POINT, JUST GO HEAD
 AND BUILD YOUR WALL.
 YOU SAY YOU WAS GOING TO BUILD
 IT.
 YOU WAS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.
 PAY FOR IT.
 NANCY IS NOT GOING TO PAY FOR
 THE WALL.
 STOP HOLDING US HOSTAGE EVERY
 TIME YOU GET A NOTE.
 ITS BEEN FIVE DAYS SINCE WE
 LEARNED ABOUT THE
 RACIST PHOTOGRAPH IN THE 1984
 YEAR BOOK OF THE
 VIRGINIA GOVERNOR.
 THOUGH HE HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN
 PUBLIC FOR DAYS HE IS
 STILL SAYING HE WON'T RESIGN.
 YESTERDAY HE GOT SOME SUPPORT
 FROM HIS OLD
 CLASSMATES.
 NINE STUDENTS HAVE COME FORWARD
 TO DEFEND THE
 GOVERNOR.
 THEY WERE ALL CLASSMATES OF HIS
 AT EASTERN VIRGINIA
 MEDICAL SCHOOL.
 LET'S START THERE AND THEN TAKE
 A LOOK AT WHAT THEY
 WROTE.
  HERE WAS THE STATEMENT.
 WE BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR IS
 NEITHER OF THE
 INDIVIDUALS IN THE COSTUMES.
 WE ATTENDED CLASSES WITH HIM.
 WE SOCIALIZED WITH HIM.
 WE KNEW HIM VERY WELL.
 YET, THINGS REMAIN ROCKY FOR
 THE GOVERNOR.
 HE HAS BEEN HELD UP IN THE
 EXECUTIVE MANSION, HIS
 CALENDAR NOT UPDATED FOR DAYS,
 MANY PUBLIC EVENTS
 CANCELED.
 BEHIND CLOSED DOORS HE IS
 TRYING TO GOVERN.
 HE SIGNED OFF ON LEGISLATION TO
 GIVE AMAZON MILLIONS
 IN INCENTIVES AND SENT OUT A
 STATEMENT OF SYMPATHY
 TO THE FAMILY OF A STATE
 TROOPER KILLED IN THE LINE
 OF DUTY.
 AT THIS POINT MANY LAWMAKERS
 FROM BOTH PARTIES, ARE
 CALLING FOR HIS RESIGNATION.
  I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY HE
 HASN'T RESIGNED BUT I'M
 PRAYING HE WILL DO THAT.
  WE HAVE CALLED FOR THE
 RESIGNATION.
 Reporter: ADDING TO THE
 CRISIS, SEXUAL ASSAULT
 ALLEGATIONS DATING BACK TO 2004
 AGAINST THE
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX.
  THE ALLEGATIONS VAPORIZED
 FOR A YEAR AND ONLY
 CAME BACK ON THE EVE OF
 ELEVATION OF -- GIVEN THE
 CURRENT SITUATION AND SO, IT'S
 ALL POLITICAL.
 IT'S A SMEAR.
  WE ARE LEARNING THAT THE
 ACCUSER OF JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX HAS HIRED A LAWYER AND
 IT'S THE SAME LEGAL
 TEAM THAT REPRESENTED THE BRETT
 KAVANAUGH ACCUSER.
 IF THE GOVERNOR WILL RESIGN,
 THAT'S ANYONE'S GUESS.
  THANK YOU.
 EASTER SEALS HAS BEEN
 MAKING PROFOUND POSITIVE
 DIFFERENCES TO THE LIVES OF
 CHILDREN AND FAMILY FOR
 ALMOST A CENTURY.
 WE VISITED PORTLAND, A 2-YEAR-
 OLD WITH A RARE
 DISORDER AT ONE OF EASTER SEALS
 CHILD DEVELOPMENT
 CENTERS.
 SHE IS NOT ONLY GETTING THE
 THERAPY SHE NEEDS TO
 LEARN TO LIVE WITH HER
 DISABILITY BUT SHE IS
 THRIVING.
  ROUND.
 WALL.
 LOOK AT THAT.
  IT'S ARTS AND CRAFTS TIME
 AT EASTER SEALS.
 HERE AT THEIR NORTHEAST DC
 CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER,
 FLOWER AND WATER IS BEING
 TURNED IN TO PLAYDOUGH.
  I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU.
  IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE
 LIKE HER FRIENDS.
 SHE HAS A VERY RARE SYNDROME.
  BASICALLY IT'S A LOT OF
 DIFFERENT ISSUES.
 FOR PORTLAND.
 SHE HAS LOW TONE.
 THAT KIND OF CAUSES HER TO HAVE
 ISSUES WHEN THIS
 COMES TO GROSS MOTOR SKILLS,
 WALKING, TALKING, EVEN
 BLADDER AND KIDNEY ISSUES
 BECAUSE OF THE LOW TONE.
 THEN WITH HER SHE HAS BALANCE
 PROBLEMS.
  IT'S A NEW SYNDROME.
 PORTLAND WAS JUST DIAGNOSED
 LAST AUGUST.
 FOR HER MOM, FINDING A DAYCARE
 WHERE SHE COULD
 THRIVE BECAME HER TOP PRIORITY.
  I WAS LOOKING FOR A
 DAYCARE.
 I WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS
 INCLUDING WHERE THEY HAD
 SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS TOGETHER.
 YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT MANY PLACES
 AROUND THE CITY.
 I ACTUALLY WAS RECOMMENDED THIS
 PLACE.
 WE CAME IN AND DID AN INTERVIEW
 AND IT WAS LIKE LOVE
 AT FIRST SIGHT.
  EASTER SEALS PROVIDES LIFE
 CHANGING SERVICES FOR
 PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.
 IT'S ALL ABOUT HELPING
 INDIVIDUALS ACHIEVE THEIR
 POTENTIAL AND LIVE MEANINGFUL
 LIVES EVERY DAY.
  EASTER SEALS PROVIDES A LOT
 OF SUPPORT TO PEOPLE
 THROUGHOUT THE SPECTRUM.
 WE TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN WHO
 ARE NORMALLY DEVELOPING

 THERAPY SERVICE.
  COME ON, PORTLAND, LET'S
 GO.
  PORTLAND RECEIVED THERAPY,
 INCLUDING PHYSICAL
 AND SPEECH THERAPY.
  SOME HAVE INTELLECTUAL
 DISABILITIES WHERE THEY
 CAN'T HAVE THE SKILLS.
 FOR PORTLAND, SHE SEEMS TO
 UNDERSTAND, SHE SEEMS TO
 KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.
 SHE IS TRYING TO VERBALIZE AND
 COMMUNICATE TO OTHERS
 WHAT IS GOING ON IN HER MIND.
  THAT IS WHERE HER SPEECH
 THERAPIST COMES IN.
 SHE IS BY PORTLAND'S SIDE ALL
 DAY TO MAKE SURE SHE
 DOESN'T MISS OUT ON ANY OF THE
 FUN.
  WE ARE USING AN AAC DEVICE.
 IT HELPS PORTLAND EXPRESS THE
 LANGUAGE THAT IS
 CHALLENGING HER VERBALLY.
 IT'S REALLY FUN.
 PORTLAND UNDERSTANDS SO MUCH.
  I THINK BECAUSE SHE IS IN A
 CLASSROOM WITH
 TYPICAL KIDS IT HELPS HER MEET
 THE MILESTONES.
  FOR A CHILD LIKE PORTLAND
 SHE HAS ONLY BEEN HERE
 LIKE FIVE OR SIX MONTHS AND HAS
 MADE SUCH GREAT
 GAINS.
  LOOK INTO IT.
 IT'S ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT IS
 -- TO ME IT'S A GEM.
 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT EXISTED.
 SO, BEING ABLE TO COME HERE AND
 SEE WHAT THEY ARE

 JOB.
 SEEING PORTLAND'S STORY AND
 JUST -- YOU KNOW, BEING
 ABLE TO RUN DOWN TO THE CHILD

 WE WILL BE BACK AFTER THIS.
  OUR NEXT GUEST WENT FROM
 WEIGHING OVER
 400 POUNDS TO THE COVER OF
 RUNNERS WORLD MAGAZINE.
 HIS INCREDIBLE WEIGHT LOSS
 JOURNEY NEXT.
 WELCOME BACK TO GREAT DAY
 WASHINGTON.
 OUR NEXT GUEST ONCE WEIGHED 420
 POUNDS BUT SOMETHING
 HAPPENED THAT SPARKED HIS
 WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY
 LEADING HIM TO THE COVER OF
 RUNNER'S WORLD MAGAZINE
 AND A HEALTHIER LIFE.
 JOSH LIFE.
 YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.
  THANK YOU.
  I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE --
 IT'S -- YOU LOOSE THE
 WEIGHT BUT IT'S THE KEEPING IT
 OFF.
 HOW DOES IT BEGIN FOR YOU
  YOU LOOSE THE WEIGHT AGAIN
 AND AGAIN.
 FOR THE 3rd OR 4th TIME IN MY
 LIFE.
 IT JUST WENT DOWN THE JOURNEY
 OF DOING ABOUT IT.
 JUST WENT DOWN THE PATH OF
 DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
 A LOT OF THOSE THINGS I DID IN
 THE BEGINNING WERE
 THE WRONG THING TO DO.
 THEY WERE CRITICAL IN GETTING
 MY MOMENTUM STARTED.
  THE THINGS YOU DID THAT
 DIDN'T WORK OR THAT
 MAYBE WORKS FOR A SHORT TIME IS
 ALL BUILT UP.
  IT'S -- THEY HAVE ALL BEEN
 LESSONS ALONG THE
 WAY.
 THAT'S SOMETHING -- THE BIGGEST
 WORD
 OUR BOOK IS DO.
 IT'S A VERY SIMPLE TWO LETTER
 WORD.
 IF IT'S WRONG OR RIGHT.
 DO SOMETHING, LET'S GET THE
 PROCESS STARTED.
 START WHERE YOU ARE AND LET'S
 START MOVING THE BALL.
  AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY
 THEY WANT TO LOOSE THE
 WEIGHT.
 THEY WANT TO LOOSE THE WEIGHT.
 IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WAS
 JUST -- THAT KIND OF
 PUSHED YOU OVER THE EDGE AND
 GOT YOU REALLY GOING ON
 THAT
  YEAH.
 IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS JUST --
 I WANTED TO LOOK
 BETTER IN A SUIT.
 I WAS EMBARRASSED ABOUT HOW I
 WAS GOING TO NEED
 TO -- I KNEW I WAS GOING TO
 HAVE TO WEAR A SUIT AT
 THE END OF 2011.
 I DIDN'T -- I WAS SCARED TO
 STUFF MY BIG FAT
 SELFINTO A SUIT.
 SO, THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED IN
 THE VERY BEGINNING.
 THE THING THAT SORT OF
 PROPELLED ME FORWARD, REALLY,
 WAS MY FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE
 PHYSICAL ASPECT OF
 THIS WHOLE THING WHICH IS THE
 RUNNING AND REALLY
 SORT OF BUYING IN TO THE FACT
 THAT I'M A BIPED.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M MEANT TO ME.
 THEN I FALL IN TO THE COMMUNITY
 OF RUNNERS AND, ONCE
 I WANTED TO BE A BETTER RUNNER,
 AND SAW THAT AS A
 MORE REAL VERSION OF MYSELF,
 THE EATING AND ALL OF
 THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE
 CHANGING IN MY LIFE WERE
 MADE MUCH EASIER FOR ME.
  WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THOUGH
 TO SOMEONE THAT
 MAYBE -- YOU KNOW -- AT THAT
 HEAVY OF A WEIGHT IT'S
 GOT TO BE HARD TO RUN AND GET
 GOING.
  TERRIBLE.
  SOMEONE WILL GET OUT THERE
 BUT EVEN IF YOU ARE
 GOING AROUND THE BLOCK BUT
 THEIR BODY HURTS AND THEY
 GET FRUSTRATED.
  SLOW DOWN, RELAX.
 WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL
 TODAY OR THIS WEEK OR
 THIS MONTH.
 WE WANT TO START WHERE WE ARE.
 WE WANT TO MOVE OURSELVES
 FORWARD.
 THAT MAY MEAN WALKING A 30
 MINUTE MILE RIGHT NOW.
 THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.
 EMBRACE IT BECAUSE THAT
 CAPACITY IS GOING TO GET YOU
 TO THE PROMISED LAND.
 WE HAVE TO REALLY HONOR WHERE
 WE ARE TODAY AND BE
 WILLING TO ENGAGE THAT FOR WHAT
 IT'S WORTH AND GROW
 IT HARD AND MOVE IT.
 THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I
 HAVE LEARNED IN THE
 PROCESS AND THAT I HAVE
 REPEATED OVER AND OVER.
  THEY SAY EXERCISE IS 20% OF
 LOSING WEIGHT.
 THE DIET IS THE 80%.
 YOU WERE A MEAT EATER.
 YOU ARE FROM LOUISIANA.
  GOSH.
 YES.
  YOU HAD PLENTY OF KING
 CAKE.
  CRAWFISH BOILS AND DEER
 MEAT.
  HOW DO -- YOU ARE PLANT
 BASED NOW.
  I'M 1000% PLANT BASED.
 YOU MAKE THE TRANSITION SLOWLY.
 IT WAS A RECKON IND AND A VERY
 UNCOMFORTABLE ONE.
 IT WAS A MATTER OF ME READING
 THINGS AND LEARNING
 ABOUT THINGS IN THIS WEIGHT
 LOSS PROCESS THAT REALLY
 STARTED TO HOLD TRUE.
 IF I WAS BEING OBJECTIVE WITH
 THE 30 DAY TESTS I WAS
 GIVING.
 I WAS USING MYSELF AS A GUINEA
 PIG.
 ONCE I LEARNED WHAT WAS ON THE
 OTHER SIDE OF THIS,
 THIS NUTRITIONAL CHANGE, THIS
 CHANGE IN, THIS CHANGE
 IN IDEA ABOUT DIET IT BECAME
 EASIER FOR ME TO ACCEPT
 IT.
 I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH CHRONIC
 DISEASE AND HEART
 DISEASE IN MY FAMILY AND IN
 FELLOW PEOPLE THAT ONCE
 I SAW THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN
 THOSE THINGS, IT FELT
 IRRESPONSIBLE OF ME, NOT LIKE
 GLUTTONY JUST LIKE I
 WAS DISRESPECTING THE HONOR AND
 THE MEMORY OF PEOPLE
 I HAD -- THAT I KNOW HAVE DIED
 OF THESE PREVENTABLE
 DISEASES.
 IT BECAME SO MUCH MORE ABOUT
 THE TASTE OF THE FOOD.
 I COULD COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
 WHY THINK OF DESSERTS
 AS DELICIOUS.
  YOUR BOOK, PEOPLE CAN GET
 IT FOR FREE AS A KINDL
 DOWNLOAD, RIGHT
  SURE.
 THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MY
 PARTNER AND MYSELF TO
 GET IN INFORMATION.
 THINGS I HAVE LEARNED THROUGH
 BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS
 OUT INTO THE WORLD THROUGH A
 PACKAGE THAT IS FREE.
 I KNOW THAT IT'S SUCH IMPORTANT
 INFORMATION TO HAVE
 THAT BARRIER, TO REMOVE THAT
 BARRIER IN SOME
 CAPACITY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO
 US.
  YOU ARE AMAZING.
 YOUR JOURNEY IS AMAZING.
 THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT WITH
 US AND HELPING OTHERS
 TO LIVE THEIR BEST HEALTHY
 LIFE.
 WE WILL SEE YOU MAYBE ON SOME
 MORE MAGAZINE COVERS
 HERE IN THE FUTURE.
 WE WILL SEE.
 JOSH, THICK TO FIT IS THE BOOK.
 WELL START HEALTH IS THE
 WEBSITE.
 TOMORROW WE ARE HIGHLIGHTING
 THE IMPORTANCE OF
 REGULAR CHECK UPS AS A PART OF
 A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
 AS WELL.
 WE ARE DOING THAT BY HOLDING A
 FREE HEALTH EXPO AT
 THE YMCA IN RESTON.
 WE CALL IT IMPACT HEALTH
 MATTERS.
 WE ARE PARTNERING THE RESTON
 HEART CENTER TO OFFER

 THROUGH 7:00.
 PLEASE GO TO THE WEBSITE,
 WUSA9.COM/HEALTH MATTERS
 FOR MORE INFORMATION AND TO
 REGISTER.
 WE HOPE TO SEE YOU OUT THERE
 TOMORROW.
 COMING UP WE ARE LEARNING
 THE PROPER WAY TO
 INSTALL A CAR SEAT.
 TODAY'S INFORMATION MAY
 WELCOME BACK TO GREAT DAY
 WASHINGTON.
 THIS MORNING WE ARE EXPLORING
 THE CORRECT WAY TO
 INSTALL A CHILD SEAT INTO YOUR
 CAR.
 WE STILL SEE IT EVERY DAY WHERE
 PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
 THEIR CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS.
 WE WILL TALK TO LARRY WALKER
 WITH THE DC, DMV.
 YOU WERE SHARING A STORY.
 YOU STILL SEE PEOPLE WHO DON'T
 USE THIS LIFE SAVING
 TOOL.
  YES.
 AS AN INSPECTOR, HERE AT THE
 MOTOR VEHICLES,
 INSPECTOR SAFETY I GET A LOT OF
 PARENTS COME THROUGH
 WITH NO RESTRAINTS FOR THE
 KIDS.
 WE HAVE -- RESOURCES WE TELL
 THEM ABOUT WHERE THEY
 CAN GET A SEAT.
 ALSO, WE CHECK THE SEAT TO MAKE
 SURE IT'S INSTALLED
 PROPERLY.
 IF IT IS IN THE CARP.
  AND RIGHT HERE, THIS IS ONE
 OF THE MORE
 VERSATILE CAR SEATS THAT YOU
 HAVE.
 THIS IS CALLED A CONVERTIBLE.
  IT'S A CONVERTIBLE.
  CAN WE TAKE THIS AND PUT IT
 IN THE CAR.
 I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME THE
 PROPER WAY TO USE THIS CAR
 SEAT.
  YES MA'AM.
  GREAT.
  ALL RIGHT.
 SO, IT'S CONVERTIBLE SEAT.
 USUALLY THIS SEAT IS RECOMMENDED FOR A
 YOUNGER CHILD.
 THIS SEAT IS DESIGNED TO FACE
 BOTH WAYS.
 REAR FACING, AND FORWARD
 FACING.
 THE REAR FACING, THERE ARE
 ADJUSTMENTS YOU HAVE TO
 MAKE.
 THIS HAS THE ADJUSTABLE BASE
 HERE THAT YOU BRING
 DOWN.
 YOU MAKE SURE THE SEAT -- WILL
 HAVE THE PROPER TILT.
 IF YOU NOTICE, THE ROOM THAT
 YOU LOOSE.
 SO, I WILL HAVE TO HAVE THIS
 SEAT.
  YOU WILL REMOVE THAT SEAT
 UP
  YEAH.
 SEE THIS CAN TAKE TWO PEOPLE TO
 DO PROPERLY.
 THERE'S A BOX HERE.
 THAT'S ABOUT.
  JUST TAKE -- [INAUDIBLE]
 OUT.
  OKAY.
  IF YOU NOTICE THE SEAT JUST
 SETTLES DOWN.
 IN REAR STATIONS, THE BABY
 SHOULD HAVE A CERTAIN
 AMOUNT OF [INAUDIBLE].
 ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER BABY
 WITH NO NECK CONTROL.
 YOU WANT TO KEEP THE HEAD BACK.
  THAT MAKES SENSE.
  THE TILT, THE ELEVATED FOOT
 HERE.
 ALLOWS THE BABY TO REST BACK.
 NOW, THIS SEAT HERE.
  WE WILL COME BACK AND
 FINISH THIS INSTALLATION.
 I ALSO WANT TO GIVE YOU A HEADS
 UP.
 WE WILL HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT
 A VOUCHER PROGRAM.
 IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A SEAT YOU
 CAN MAKE SURE YOU GET
 ONE.
 THAT'S COMING UP AFTER THIS.
  OKAY.
 COMING UP WE ARE MAKING
 BLACK TRUFFLE PASTA WITH
 A CHEF FROM LUPE VERDE IN THE
 KITCHEN.
  TEMPERATURES ARE ON THE
 RISE.
 WE ARE
     <i> When was the last time</i>          <i> you felt...</i>
              <i> Free.</i>

     <i> With the compassion and</i>      <i> strength of a name...</i>
  <i> Most accepted by top doctors</i>        <i> and specialists.</i>
   <i> And the power of a card...</i>
       <i> that opens doors in</i>        <i> all fifty states.</i>
 <i> Giving you the freedom to love</i>       <i> to dream to dance</i>
    <i> Like no one is watching.</i>
            <i> CareFirst</i>     <i> Blue Cross Blue Shield.</i>
         <i> Live fearless.</i>
 WE ARE EXPECTING SHOWERS.
 OTHERWISE STILL DEALING

 THE CUMBERLAND AND
 ROMNEY AREA.
 AS YOU APPROACH THE FIVE AND

  BEAUTIFUL.
 YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF US WHO
 GREW UP IN THE 08'S
 AND 90'S ON THE CANNED, FROZEN
 FOOD, I CAN'T TAKE
 MORE OF IT.
 YOU HAVE THE FRESH INGREDIENTS.
  EVERYTHING FRESH.
  HOW DO YOU GET STARTED WITH
 THIS
  LOOK AT THIS.
  THIS MAY COME FROM GROWING
 UP WITH YOUR ITALIAN
 GRANDMOTHER, RIGHT
  YEP.
  I'M SCARED.
  OLIVE OIL, BUTTER, A LITTLE
 BIT OF BLACK PEPPER
 WITH SALT.
 SALT.
 A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.
 ALL RIGHT.
 LOOK AT THIS.
  AMAZING.
  YOU SEA THE PASTA BOILING
 IN THERE.
 HOW LONG DO YOU BOIL IT
  JUST TWO MINUTES.
  TWO MINUTES AND YOU ARE
 DONE.
  YES.
  IT'S SO FRESH. YOU CAN'T GO
 WRONG WITH FRESH PASTA.
 MY GOODNESS. I DON'T WANT TO BREAK IT.
  TELL ME ABOUT THE FLAVOR IT
 ADDS FROM THE PASTA.
  WONDERFUL BLACK TRUFFLE
 FROM TUSCANY.
 IT'S IN SEASON RIGHT NOW.
 IT'S A WINTER BLACK TRUFFLE.
  BEAUTIFUL.
  GOOD FOR RISOTTO AND PASTA.
 PROTEIN LIKE A BEEF STEAK.
  AND YOUR BEEF LASA GNA THAT
 YOU HAVE HERE.
  WITH SHAVED BLACK PEPPER.
 WE HAVE THE SALAD WITH CEASAR.
 ORANGE AS WELL.
 ON YOUR SCREEN YOU SEE THE BEEF
 LASAGNA.
 LOOK AT THAT.
  BEEF RAGU.
  THAT'S AMORE.
 THEN YOU HAVE THE.
 BIRATTA SALAD.
 IT'S CREAMY INSIDE.
  YUM.

  BEAUTIFUL DISH.
 NOW, GETTING BACK TO THE --
 IT'S BOILED FOR TWO
 MINUTES.
  MY GOSH.

  OKAY.
 THEN YOU PUT IT IN THE PAN TO

 FLAVOR
 I'M GETTING AWA  FROM THAT.
 THINGS ARE POPPING IN THE GREAT
 DAY KITCHEN.
  ALL RIGHT.
 OKAY.
 LOOK AT THIS.

 FLAVOR, A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER.
  ALL RIGHT.
 I UNDERSTAND.
  AND THEN.
  WE HAVE TO WRAP.
  PLEASE.
 DO IT FOR ME.
  HOW MUCH IS THAT LIKE A
 HUNDRED DOLLARS
  A LOT.
 A LOT.
  THERE YOU GO.
 THERE YOU GO.

  I DON'T THINK SO.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
  I DON'T THINK SO
 THEY SAY THAT A WAY TO A
 WOMAN'S HEART IS
 THROUGH HER STOMACH.
  LOOK AT THIS.
  WE WILL BE BACK WITH MORE
 AFTER THIS.
 I WILL STUFF MY FACE.
 COMING UP WE ARE LEARNING
 THE PROPER WAY TO
 INSTALL A CAR SEAT.
 WE HAVE AN EXPERT THERE.
 HE WILL JOIN US.
 AND A FEDERAL WORKER WHO
 RELIED ON HER PASSION
 FOR AFRICAN JEWELRY TO SUPPORT
 HER THROUGH THE
 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN HOW
 WELCOME BACK TO GREAT DAY
 WASHINGTON.
 WE ARE LEARNING THE PROPER WAY
 TO INSTALL CAR SEATS
 FOR THOSE KIDS OUT THERE.
 WE HAVE LARRY WALKER HERE OF
 THE DMV DC.
 HE DOES THIS ALL DAY LONG.
 WE ARE TALKED ABOUT THE COMMON
 THINGS THAT YOU SEE.
 IF I CAN GET MY PHOTOGRAPHER TO
 MOVE IN HERE.
 WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
 LABEL.
 WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
 THESE LABELS ON CAR
 SEATS
  WHEN INSTALLING THIS
 PARTICULAR SEAT.
 IT'S A CONVERTIBLE.
 IT CAN FACE BOTH WAYS.
 DEPENDING ON THE CHILD'S WEIGHT
 AND AGE, ONE
 DIRECTION WILL BE INCORRECT.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE LABEL, ITS
 CLEARLY MARKED AS TO
 THE WEIGHT LIMIT, THE LOWEST
 LIMIT, THE HIGHEST
 LIMIT, REAR FACING, AND FOR
 FORWARD FACING.
 YOU HAVE THE SAME LABEL, AND
 IT'S -- ALSO HAS THE
 WEIGHT LIMIT AND THE MAXIMUM.
  THERE'S NO WIGGLE ROOM ON
 THESE.
 PEOPLE NEED TO ADHERE TO WHAT
 THEY READ AND WHAT IS
 ON THE LABEL.
  NOW, THE AVERAGE PERSON
 PURCHASING THIS SEAT
 WOULD ASSUME BY IT BEING REAR
 FACING, FORWARD FACING
 THAT THE BELT IS ALREADY SET
 UP.
 AS YOU SEE, THIS BELT HERE IS
 IN FORWARD FACING.
  THIS CAN BE KIND OF
 COMPLEX.
 IS THIS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME
 TO YOU
 YOU WILL INSTALL IT BUT BEYOND
 THAT, YOU TEACH
 PEOPLE.
  YES, MA'AM.
 WE ARE HERE TO BUILD PEOPLE'S
 CONFIDENCE THAT
 THEY -- THEY ARE SECURING THEIR
 BABY PROPERLY.
  YOU ARE A FATHER.
  I AM.
 WHEN I HAVE MY KIDS WE DIDN'T
 HAVE ALL OF THIS
 INSTRUCTION AND DIRECTION.
  THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO
 -- YES, ADHERE TO

  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
  FEBRUARY IS NATIONAL CANNED
 FOOD MONTH.
 YOU THINK OF CANNED FOOD.
 HOW CAN WE USE THOSE TO PUT
 GOOD FOOD ON OUR TABLE
  WHEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
 INGREDIENTS ON HAND IT'S
 EASY TO WHIP UP A CREATIVE,
 DELICIOUS, HEALTHY MEAL.
 ESPECIALLY DURING THE BUSY
 WORKWEEKS THAT YOU CAN
 FEEL GOOD ABOUT SERVING FAMILY
 AND FRIENDS.
 LISTEN TO THIS.
 A WELL STOCKED PANTRY FULL OF
 CANNED FRUIT AND
 VEGETABLES CAN HELP YOU SERVE
 UP THE RECOMMENDED 42
 CUPS OF FRUIT AND 53 CUPS OF
 VEGETABLES A FAMILY OF
 FOUR NEEDS EVERY WEEK.
  WE HEAR ALL THE TIME TO
 SHOP ON THE OUTSIDE OF A
 GROCERY STORE.
 WITH THESE CANNED FOODS HOW
 DOES THEIR VALUE COMPARE
 TO THE FRESH FRUITS AND
 VEGETABLES WE GET IN THE
 PRODUCE SECTION
  SOME CANNED FOOD HAVE EQUAL
 IF NOT BETTER
 PROFILES COMPARED TO THEIR
 FRESH AND FROZEN
 COUNTERPARTS.
 THAT'S BECAUSE FRUIT AND
 VEGETABLES ARE HARVESTED AT
 THEIR PEAK OF RIPENESS AND THEN
 WITH IN FOUR HOURS
 THEY ARE CANNED WHICH LOCKS IN
 THEIR NUTRITION,
 THEIR FLAVOR AND THEIR
 DELICIOUSNESS.
 ANY TIME OF YEAR YOU WANT FRUIT
 OR VEGETABLES,
 WHETHER IN SEASON OR NOT YOU
 HAVE FULL ACCESS TO IT
 WITHOUT ANY ADDITIVES OR
 PRESERVIAIVES.
  I LOVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE
 TIME TO GO TO THE STORE
 YOU SHOULD KEEP THOSE STOCKED
 JUST IN CASE YOU NEED
 SOMETHING GOOD.
 WHAT EXAMPLES CAN YOU SHOW US
  ASSOCIATION I HAVE A LOT OF
 YUMMY DISHES.
 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT MY  KID
 LOVE.
 I SERVE THIS CHICKEN AND
 VEGETABLE SALAD.
 YOU OPEN UP YOUR FRIDGE AND YOU
 ARE READY TO COOK
 AND ALL THE SUDDEN IT'S SPOILED
 AND YOU HAVE TO
 THROW IT OUT AND YOU FEEL
 HORRIBLE
 SO THIS IS WHERE THIS COMES IN.
 I USE CANNED STRING BEANS AND
 DICED TOMATOES.
 I DON'T HAVE TO BUY AS MUCH SO
 I THROW OUT LESS.
  AND IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE.
 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WE SHOULD
 HAVE IN OUR PANTRY
 WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIALS YOU
 SUGGEST WE ALWAYS HAVE
  I LIKE TO RECOMMEND A
 PROTEIN FOR EXAMPLE.
 SO, LIKE SALMON, TUNA OR
 CHICKEN.
 FRUITS OR VEGETABLES.
 PEACHES, TOMATOES AND ALL TYPES
 OF BEANS.
 ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY
 KIDS AND ADULTS WHO USE
 SIX OR MORE CANNED FRUITS PER
 WEEK ARE MORE LIKELY
 TO HAVE DIETS HIGHER IN 17
 ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS .
