I can keep apologizing... Or I can... I can hope my pain gets better on its own... Or I can talk to my gynecologist today! You didn't choose to have endometriosis... but you can choose to ask if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA is specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. In clinical trials, ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 common types of endometriosis pain, painful periods, pelvic pain in between periods, and pain with sex. Don't use ORILISSA if you are or may be pregnant, have osteoporosis, severe liver disease, or are taking drugs like cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. It may cause abnormal liver tests. ORILISSA may change your periods, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. It does not prevent pregnancy. Use birth control that does not contain hormones. ORILISSA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. It may also cause bone loss. Ask your gynecologist if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA. Made for endo pain. 60% of women wear the wrong size pad and can experience leaks. You don't have to. With Always My Fit, try the next size up and get up to 20% better coverage day or night. Because better coverage means better protection. Always
