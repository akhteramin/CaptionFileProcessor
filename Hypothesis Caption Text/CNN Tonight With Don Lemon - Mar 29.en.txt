 GUARANTEED WHAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE.
 CLOSING THE BORDER ISN'T THE
 FIX.
 NEITHER IS BLAMING OTHERS.
 US THAT EMERGENCY TOó DEAL WITH
 THE REAL EMERGENCY.
 SHOW THE DEAL MAKING POWER THAT
 YOU BRAGLL THE■/■/.
 GET THESE PEOPLE TO ACT.
 YOU WANT TO GET MORE T THE
 BASEó YOU, STOP MAKING
 EXCUSES.
 MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN HERE.
 YOUR PEOPLE ARE CRYING OUT FOR
 HELP.
 OTHERWISE, THE QUESTIONL
 CLEARLY BECOME WHY DID YOU ALLOW
 THIS TO HAPPEN.
 IT'S TIME FOR THE MAN.
 "CNN TONIGHT" WITH D. LEMON ON A
 FRIDAY NIGHT, WHAT'S BETTER THAN
 THAT?
 NOTHING, MY FRIENDS.
 PEOPLE CALL ME D. LEMON ON
 THE STREETS ALL THE TIME.
 YOU'RE WELCOME.
 YOU'RE WELCOME.
 I CARRY YOU LIKE ATLAS CARRIES
 THE GLOBE.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 NOTHING.
 I'M NOT GOING TO GO THERE.
 WHAT WAS YOUR OLD NICKNAME?
 I NEVER HAD AN OLD NICKNAME.
 THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.
 WELL, MR. DON LEMON,
 SUPERHERO.
 SO I GOT TO TELL YOU --
 PLEASE.
 YOU SAID THE DEAL MAKING.
 WASN'T THE DEAL -- REMEMBER THE
 ORIGINAL DEAL THAT HE WAS
 SUPPOSED TO MAKE?
 NO.
 MEXICO WAS GOING TO PAY FOR
 THAT WALL.
 OH, YES, THAT DEAL.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
 IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
 THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
 IT WAS BLUSTER, AND THE WALL
 WAS A FARCE.
 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
 LOOK.
 I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH
 THEM BUILDING PHYSICAL BARRIERS.
 IT'S JUST NOT A PANACEA.
 THERE'S ALREADY A PHYSICAL
 BARRIER IN A LOT OF PLACE.
 THERE IS, BUT, LOOK, THEY
 NEED MORE.
 IF THEY HAD MORE, THEY WOULDN'T
 HAVE THE FLOW PROBLEMS THEY HAVE
 RIGHT NOW.
 I BELIEVE THAT.
 BUT THEY NEEDED MORE THAN JUST
 THAT.
 AND YOU KNOW, TRIPP, ROY,
 CICILLINE SAYS WE GAVE THEM THAT
 STUFF TOO.
 IT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T ENOUGH.
 NOW I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE,
 AND THEI GUARANTEE YOU THEY'RE
 GOING TO SAY, WE NEED, WE NEED,
 WE NEED.
 EVERYBODY HERE IS TALKING ABOUT
 LONG-TERM FIXES AND WE HAVE TO
 HAVE A DEAL AND CONSERVATIVE
 THIS AND LONG-TERM THAT.
 DEAL WITH IT NOW.
 GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED.
 BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
 WHY CAN'T HE JUST BE HONEST
 ABOUT IT?
 WHY DOES HE HAVE TO LIE ABOUT
 WE'RE ALREADY BUILDING THE NEW
 SECTIONS OF THE WALL?
 IT IS COMPLETELY, 100% NOT TRUE.
 IT IS A LIE.
 THERE'S NO NEW WALL THAT'S BEING
 BUILT.
 THERE WILL BE.
 IF HE KEEPS SAYING IT LONG
 ENOUGH, HE'LL BE RIGHT.
 AND HE HAS TO DEFINE THEM AS A
 BROWN MENACE.
 HE HAS TO BE STRONG.
 HE HAS TO TALK ABOUT CLOSING OFF
 AND --
 THAT'S NOT STRENGTH.
 -- AND BEING TOUGH BECAUSE
 THAT IS WHAT HE'S SELLING
 PEOPLE.
 HE CAN'T SAY WHAT WE'RE SAYING.
 HE CAN'T SAY, LOOK AT THESE
 FACES.
 HOW CAN WE LET THEM BE LIKE
 THIS?
 LET'S FIND A BETTER WAY.
 WE DON'T HAVE TO LET THEM ALL
 IN, BUT WE HAVE TO TREAT THEM
 ALL WITH CONNELL MPASSION.
 THIS IS AMERICA, DAMN IT.
 HE'S SELLING OUTRAGE.
 THESE ARE YOUR WORDS.
 HE'S TAKING YOU FOR A SUCKER.
 AND HE'S HOPING YOU WILL
 SWALLOW WHAT HE'S FEEDING YOU,
 BUT IT'S A BAD DIET FOR
 DEMO
 DEMOCRACY.
 THAT'S WHAT A CON MAN DOES.
 THE CON MAN IS FOR
 CONFIDENCE, AND THAT'S WHY HE
 COMES AT YOU 100 EVERY TIME.
 MANY PEOPLE FALL FOR THE LONG
 CON EVERY TIME.
 THANK YOU, SIR.
 D. LEMON, MY MAN.
 GREAT WEEKEND.■UIT.
 THIS IS "CNN TONIGHT."
 I'M DON LEMON.
 WHAT A WEEK IT HAS BEEN.
 THINK ABOUT IT.

 SUNDAY THE REPORT CAME OUT,
 RIGHT?
 THIS TIME LAST WEEK WE GOT OUR
 FIRST LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL, WILLIAM BARR, ON THE
 MURALER INVESTIGATION SAYING IT
 WAS COMPLETE.
 THERE HAVE BEEN TWO MORE LETTERS
 SINCE THEN.
 THE LATEST ONE RIGHT HERE.
 THE LATEST ONE JUST TODAY, ALL
 RIGHT?
 A LOT OF NEWS IN IT.
 MUELLER'S REPORT EXPECTED TO BE
 RELEASED TO CONGRESS AND THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE, TO THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE, BY MID-APRIL IF NOT
 SOONER, OKAY?
 BUT BARR IS SAYING THE PROCESS
 OF REDACTING THE REPORT IS,
 QUOTE, WELL ALONG AND THAT
 MUELLER HIMSELF IS ASSISTING.
 ALL OF THAT IS REALLY
 IMPORTANT.
 BUT IT ALSO RAISES A LOT OF
 QUESTIONS.
 A LOT.
 AND SINCE WE DON'T YET HAVE
 MUELLER'S FULL REPORT, A REPORT
 THAT BARR WRITES IS NEARLY 400
 PAGES LONG BY THE WAY, THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LETTERS,
 WELL, THEY'RE ALL WE HAVE TO GO
 ON.
 SO I WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS
 LATEST LETTER IF YOU WILL ALLOW
 ME POINT BY POINT BECAUSE
 THERE'S SOME VERY IMPORTANT
 INFORMATION IN THERE.
 HERE IS HOW IT BEGINS.
 IT BEGINS THIS WAY.
 DEAR CHAIRMAN GRAHAM AND
 CHAIRMAN NADLER, I WRITE IN
 RESPONSE TO CHAIRMAN NADLER'S
 MARCH 25th, 2019 LETTER AND
 CHAIRMAN GRAHAM'S MARCH 27th,
 2019 LETTER, WHICH ADDRESSED THE
 INVESTIGATION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL
 ROBERT S. MUELLER III AND THE
 CONFIDENTIAL REPORT HE HAS
 SUBMITTED TO ME.
 HE'S REFERRING THERE TO NADLER'S
 LETTER REQUIRING MUELLER'S FULL
 REPORT TO BE RELEASED TO
 CONGRESS NO LATER THAN APRIL
 2nd, RIGHT?
 THAT'S THIS COMING TUESDAY.
 NADLER TODAY INSISTING THAT
 DEADLINE STILL STANDS EVEN
 THOUGH BARR IS APPARENTLY GOING
 TO MISS IT.
 HE'S ALSO REFERRING TO GRAHAM'S
 INVITATION TO THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE
 SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
 SO BARR GOES ON TO SAY -- HE
 SAYS, AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED, I
 SHARE YOUR DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT
 CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC HAVE THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S REPORT.
 WE ARE PREPARING THE REPORT FOR
 RELEASE, MAKING THE REDACTIONS
 THAT ARE REQUIRED.
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS ASSISTING
 US IN THIS PROCESS.
 SPECIFICALLY, WE ARE WELL ALONG
 IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING
 AND REDACTING THE FOLLOWING --
 ONE, MATERIAL THAT BY LAW CANNOT
 BE MADE PUBLIC.
 TWO, MATERIAL THE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMUNITY IDENTIFIES AS
 POTENTIALLY COMPROMISING
 SENSITIVE SOURCES AND METHODS.
 AND THEN THREE, MATERIAL THAT
 COULD AFFECT OTHER ONGOING
 MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE THAT THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS REFERRED TO
 OTHER DEPARTMENT OFFICES.
 AND, FOUR, INFORMATION THAT
 WOULD UNDULY INFRINGE ON
 PERSONAL PRIVACY AND
 REPUTATIONAL INTERESTS OF
 PERIPHERAL THIRD PARTIES.
 LOTS OF REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF
 THERE, OKAY?
 BARR IS WELL AWARE OF ALL THE
 DEMANDS FOR THE RELEASE OF THE
 FULL MUELLER REPORT.
 HE'S WELL AWARE THAT EVEN THE
 PRESIDENT AGREES THE REPORT
 SHOULD BE■■■■■AS■■MR.■■■■■■■T
 INTENDS TO RELEASE THE MUELLER
 REPORT IN FULL TO CONGRESS AND
 THE PUBLI
 DOú■ AGREE WITH THAT DECISION,
 AND DO YOU WANT THE WHITE HOUSE
 TO TAKE A LOOK OVER IT FOR
 PRIVILEGE?
 I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND IF
 THAT'S WHAT HE'D LIKE TO DO, I
 HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.
 SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT IN
 JUST THE SECOND SENTENCE OF HIS
 LETTER, BARR SAYS HE WANTS
 CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC TO BE
 ABLE TO READ THE REPORT.
 COMPARE THAT TO WHAT HE WROTE
 LAST WEEK, SAYING HIS GOAL WAS
 TO, QUOTE, RELEASE AS MUCH OF
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S REPORT AS
 I CAN.
 OKAY.
 BUT BACK TO THE LETTER NOW.
 BARR GOES ON TO LAY OUT FOUR
 PRETTY BROAD CATEGORIES OF
 MATERIAL TO BE REDACTED --
 INFORMATION FROM THE GRAND JURY,
 SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE
 INFORMATION, INFORMATION RELATED
 TO ONGOING LEGAL MATTERS, AND
 INFORMATION THAT WOULD INFRINGE
 ON THE PRIVACY OF PERIPHERAL
 THIRD PARTIES.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS AN
 AWFUL LOT OF DISCRETION THERE.
 THE QUESTION OF EXACTLY WHAT
 MUST BE REDACTED IN ANY OF THOSE
 CATEGORIES IS FAR FROM BLACK AND
 WHITE.
 YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER JUST HOW
 MUCH INFORMATION WILL BE BLACKED
 OUT.
 MUELLER USED THE GRAND JURY
 EXTENSIVELY.
 IN FACT, THEY'RE STILL WORKING,
 SO THAT COULD MEAN A LOT OF
 REDACTIONS RIGHT THERE.
 CHAIRMAN NADLER RESPONDING
 TONIGHT, SAYING, QUOTE, RATHER
 THAN EXPEND VALUABLE TIME AND
 RESOURCES TRYING TO KEEP CERTAIN
 PORTIONS OF THIS REPORT FROM
 CONGRESS, HE SHOULD WORK WITH US
 TO REQUEST A COURT ORDER TO
 RELEASE ANY AND ALL GRAND JURY
 INFORMATION TO THE HOUSE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS HAS
 OCCURRED IN EVERY SIMILAR
 INVESTIGATION IN THE PAST.
 THERE IS AMPLE PRECEDENT FOR THE
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHARING
 ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL PROPOSES TO
 REDACT TO THE APPROPRIATE
 CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.
 AGAIN, CONGRESS MUST SEE THE
 FULL REPORT.
 OUR LEGAL EXPERTS ARE GOING TO
 WEIGH IN ON THAT TONIGHT ON THIS
 PROGRAM.
 AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF
 INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION.
 HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
 ADAM SCHIFF TWEETS THIS.
 CONGRESS HAS ASKED FOR THE
 ENTIRE MUELLER REPORT AND
 UNDERLYING EVIDENCE BY APRIL
 2nd.
 THAT DEADLINE STANDS.
 IN THE MEANTIME, BARR SHOULD
 SEEK COURT APPROVAL JUST LIKE IN
 WATERGATE TO ALLOW THE RELEASE
 OF GRAND JURY MATERIAL.
 REDACTIONS ARE UNACCEPTABLE.
 FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
 INTELLIGENCE MR. JAMES CLAPPER,
 HE'S GOING TO WEIGH IN ON THAT
 TONIGHT.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ALSO SAYS
 THAT MUELLER HIMSELF IS INVOLVED
 IN THE PROCESS OF REDACTING HIS
 OWN REPORT, WHICH MAY GIVE BARR
 SOME INSULATION FROM CRITICISM
 IF HE CAN POINT TO MUELLER'S
 INVOLVEMENT.
 BUT BACK NOW TO TONIGHT'S
 LETTER, OKAY?
 AND THIS IS A QUOTE.
 OUR PROGRESS IS SUCH THAT I
 ANTICIPATE WE WILL BE IN A
 POSITION TO RELEASE THE REPORT
 BY MID-APRIL IF NOT SOONER.
 ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT WOULD
 HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT
 PRIVILEGE OVER CERTAIN PARTS OF
 THE REPORT, HE HAS STATED
 PUBLICLY THAT HE INTENDS TO
 DEFER TO ME, AND ACCORDINGLY
 THERE ARE NO PLANS TO SUBMIT THE
 REPORT TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A
 PRIVILEGE REVIEW.
 NO PLANS TO SUBMIT THE REPORT TO
 THE WHITE HOUSE.
 BUT THAT IS FAR FROM AN
 IRON-CLAD GUARANTEE, AND IT
 DOESN'T RULE OUT BARR HIMSELF
 RAISING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ON
 THE PRESIDENT'S BEHALF.
 AND THERE IS MORE.
 QUOTE, ALSO I AM AWARE OF SOME
 MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER PUBLIC
 STATEMENTS MISCHARACTERIZING MY
 MARCH 24th, 2019, SUPPLEMENTAL
 NOTIFICATION AS A SUMMARY OF THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION
 AND REPORT.
 FOR EXAMPLE, CHAIRMAN NADLER'S
 MARCH 25th LETTER REFERS TO MY
 SUP
 SUPPLEMENTAL -- MY MARCH 24th
 LETTER WAS NOT AND DID NOT
 PURPORT TO BE AN EXHAUSTIVE
 RECOUNTING OF THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION OR
 REPORT.
 AS MY LETTER MADE CLEAR, MY
 NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESS AND THE
 PUBLIC PROVIDED PENDING RELEASE
 OF THE REPORT, A SUMMARY OF ITS
 PRINCIPLE CONCLUSIONS.
 THAT IS ITS BOTTOM LINE.
 THE SPECIAL'S COUNSEL REPORT IS
 NEARLY 400 PAGES LONG, EXCLUSIVE
 OF TABLES AND OTHER INFORMATION.
 400 PAGES LONG EXCLUSIVE OF
 TABLES AND OTHER INFORMATION AND
 ANOTHER APPENDICES.
 AND SET FORTH THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S FINDINGS, HIS
 ANALYSIS, AND THE REASONS FOR
 HIS CONCLUSIONS.
 EVERYONE WILL SOON BE ABLE TO
 READ IT ON THEIR OWN.
 I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE IN
 THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST FOR ME TO
 ATTEMPT TO SUMMARIZE THE FULL
 REPORT OR TO RELEASE IT IN
 SERIAL OR PIECEMEAL FASHION.
 NOT IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST TO
 SUMMARIZE THE REPORT?
 WELL, NOW HE TELLS US THAT.
 IT IS TRUE THAT THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL CALLED HIS PREVIOUS
 LETTER A SUMMARY OF ITS
 PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS, NOT A
 SUMMARY -- CALLED A SUMMARY OF
 ITS PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS, NOT
 JUST A SUMMARY.
 BUT RATHER THAN DEBATE
 SEMANTICS, WHY NOT JUST RELEASE
 THE ENTIRE REPORT AND LET US
 DECIDE FOR OURSELVES?
 SO HERE'S HOW THE LETTER ENDS,
 AND I READ FROM THE LETTER.
 AS I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH BOTH OF
 YOU, I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE
 APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO TESTIFY
 PUBLICLY ON BEHALF OF THE
 DEPARTMENT SHORTLY AFTER THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S REPORT IS MADE
 PUBLIC.
 I AM CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO
 TESTIFY BEFORE THE SENATE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON MAY 1,
 2019, AND BEFORE THE HOUSE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON MAY 2nd
 OF 2019.
 FINALLY, IN THE INTEREST OF
 KEEPING THE PUBLIC INFORMED AS
 TO THESE MATTERS, I INTEND TO
 MAKE THIS LETTER PUBLIC AFTER
 DELIVERING IT TO YOU.
 SINCERELY, WILLIAM P. BARR,
 ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 SO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS
 THAT HE IS AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY
 ON MAY 1 AND MAY 2, WHICH IF THE
 REPORT IS RELEASED, THAT WOULD
 BE MID-APRIL AS PROMISED.
 THAT WOULD BE TWO WEEKS LATER.
 TWO WEEKS LATER.
 THAT'S A REALLY LONG TIME TO
 WAIT FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO
 ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT WILL
 UNDOUBTEDLY BE RAISED BY THIS
 REPORT.
 THAT'S A LONG TIME, A COUPLE
 WEEKS.
 BUT THE PRESIDENT ISN'T WAITING
 FOR THE RELEASE OF THE REPORT.
 HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT
 TWEETED TODAY.
 THE PRESIDENT TWEETED TODAY, HE
 SAID, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TAKE
 OUR VICTORY AND SAY NO.
 WE'VE GOT A LOT OF COUNTRY TO
 RUN.
 SO MUCH FOR DEFERRING TO THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL RIGHT THERE.
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
 WHAT'S IN THIS LETTER.
 WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DISCUSS.
 CNN'S EVAN PEREZ IS HERE.
 LET'S BRING IN EVAN RIGHT NOW.
 EVAN, HOW MUCH PRESSURE WAS THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER TO
 RELEASE THIS REPORT TODAY?
 WELL, I THINK THERE'S A LOT
 OF PRESSURE.
 I THINK YOU SAW THE DEMOCRATS,
 CHAIRMAN NADLER, AND EVEN
 LINDSEY GRAHAM HAVE BEEN TRYING
 TO GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION
 FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAD GIVEN
 HIM APRIL 2nd AS A DEADLINE, AND
 I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, DON,
 IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TRYING
 TO AT LEAST SHOW TO THE MEMBERS
 OF CONGRESS THAT, LOOK, YOU'RE
 GOING TO GET SOME ANSWERS.
 YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME ANSWERS
 PERHAPS EVEN FASTER THAN I FIRST
 INDICATED.
 BUT LET THERE BE NO DOUBT.
 I MEAN THE TWO SIDES ARE HEADED
 TO A CONFRONTATION, RIGHT?
 BECAUSE WHATEVER BARR RELEASES
 IN MID-APRIL, IN A COUPLE OF
 WEEKS, WILL NOT BE THE FULL
 REPORT.
 THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
 REDACTIONS, SOME OF WHICH YOU
 JUST LISTED THE FOUR CATEGORIES
 OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
 REDACTED.
 AND SO THEN THE FIGHT BEGINS.
 AND I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
 ALREADY POINTED OUT THAT THE
 GOAL POSTS HAVE MOVED.
 IT'S NOT JUST THE FULL MUELLER
 REPORT THAT THEY WANT, BUT THEY
 WANT THE UNDERLYING EVIDENCE.
 THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE
 MUELLER TURNED UP DURING THIS
 22-MONTH INVESTIGATION, DON.
 AND SO I THINK, AGAIN, A
 CONFRONTATION IS COMING.
 THERE'S GOING TO BE A SUBPOENA
 EVENTUALLY PROBABLY, AND THEN
 THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO END UP
 IN LITIGATION BEFORE A JUDGE.
 NADLER'S NOT SATISFIED WITH
 THIS RESPONSE.
 SO WHAT IS HE SAYING?
 WHAT ARE HIS CONCERNS?
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 HE SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH,
 AND HE WANTS -- STILL WANTS THE
 FULL REPORT RELEASED
 IMMEDIATELY, AND HE WANTS TO SEE
 THE UNDERLYING EVIDENCE.
 SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
 SEE IS THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP THE
 PRESSURE UP ON THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL.
 I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S
 HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, DON, IS THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO
 MAKE SURE THAT THEY SEE -- THAT
 THEY SHOW A UNIFIED FRONT.
 SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE -- YOU
 SAW BARR REFER TO SPECIAL
 COUNSEL MUELLER STAYING ON TO
 HELP WITH SOME OF THESE
 REDACTIONS.
 AND YOU HAVE ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHO
 IS ALSO STILL IN THE BUILDING,
 AND SO I THINK THE THREE MEN ARE
 NOW BASICALLY TRYING TO SHOW A
 UNIFIED FRONT TO THE MEMBERS OF
 CONGRESS TO SHOW, LOOK, THIS IS
 NOT JUST BARR'S INTERPRETATION
 OF MUELLER, BUT THIS IS ALL OF
 OUR WORK.
 EVAN PEREZ, THANK YOU FOR
 YOUR REPORTING.
 I APPRECIATE THAT.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS
 WRITTEN THREE LETTERS IN A WEEK
 ON THE MUELLER REPORT BUT THERE
 ARE MORE AND MORE UNANSWERED
 QUESTIONS.
 WILL WE GET THOSE ANSWERS FROM
 REDACTED?REPORT, OR WEY
          to try.

 ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR IN A LETTER TO CONGRESS RELEASED
 TODAY SAYING HE IS WELL ALONG IN
 MAKING REDACTIONS IN ROBERT
 MUELLER'S REPORT AND EXPECTS TO
 SEND IT TO CAPITOL HILL BY
 MID-APRIL, IF NOT SOONER.
 AND HE SAYS HE'S GETTING
 ASSISTANCE ON THE REDACTIONS
 FROM THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 HIMSELF.
 A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.
 MATTHEW ROSENBERG IS HERE, HARRY
 LITMAN, AND GARRETT GRAFF.
 GARRETT, I'M GOING TO START WITH
 YOU.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS THE
 MUELLER REPORT, A LITTLE OVER
 400 PAGES.
 EVERYONE WILL GET TO READ IT
 THEMSELVES.
 HIS PREVIOUS LETTER WAS NOT A
 SUMMARY.
 WHY DIDN'T HE SAY THIS FROM THE
 VERY BEGINNING?
 I THINK THAT'S A GREAT
 QUESTION, AND ONE OF THE THINGS
 THAT REALLY STRUCK ME IN READING
 THIS LETTER WAS THERE WAS VERY
 LITTLE IN IT THAT HE COULDN'T
 HAVE SAID LAST FRIDAY OR ON
 SUNDAY AND THAT IN SOME WAYS I
 FIND IT SUSPICIOUS THAT WE'RE
 LEARNING THESE ADDITIONAL
 DETAILS ONLY NOW.
 WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT VERY
 DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE FRIDAY
 LETTER OR THE SUNDAY SUMMARY,
 WHICH HE IS NO LONGER CALLING A
 SUMMARY, IF WE HAD KNOWN IT WAS
 400 PAGES.
 THIS IS A QUESTION I'VE BEEN
 ASKING ALL WEEK.
 I ASKED IT ON THIS SHOW EARLY IN
 THE WEEK THAT, YOU KNOW,
 LEARNING 65 WORDS OUT OF A
 400-PAGE REPORT IS NOT REALLY
 GETTING A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT IT
 SAYS.
 THIS IS, TO ME, SORT OF THE
 HORSE THIEF SAYING, MAYBE IT'S
 TIME TO CLOSE THE BARN DOOR
 AFTER THE HORSE IS ALREADY GONE.
 MATTHEW, DO YOU THINK BARR'S
 TIMING -- YOU THINK IT WAS
 INTENTIONAL?
 IS HE TRYING FOR A RESTART HERE,
 TRYING TO RESET THINGS?
 I MEAN PERHAPS.
 HE MAY JUST NOT BE GOOD AT
 ROLLING OUT KIND OF MEDIA
 STRATEGY HERE.
 I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION OF,
 YOU KNOW, WHY DIDN'T THEY HAVE
 THIS THING READY TO GO WHEN THEY
 ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS DONE?
 RIGHT.
 THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A LOT OF
 SENSE, WOULD HAVE ANSWERED A LOT
 OF QUESTIONS.
 I DO THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY
 SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE PRESIDENT
 THAT HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT WHILE
 THERE MAY BE NO CHARGEABLE
 CRIMES IN THERE, THAT THERE ARE
 DETAILS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO
 LOOK GOOD.
 YOU MEANT WHY DIDN'T THEY
 HAVE IT READY TO GO, A VERSION
 FOR THE PUBLIC AND THEN --
 IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
 YEAH.
 I ASKED THAT VERY QUESTION
 LAST NIGHT.
 GO AHEAD.
 SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU.
 IT WOULD HAVE MADE FAR LESS
 QUESTIONS.
 THIS KIND OF DRIBBLING OUT OF
 THINGS, IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.
 IT RAISES QUESTIONS LIKE GARRETT
 JUST BROUGHT UP THAT ARE THEY
 TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING?
 ARE THEY TRYING TO CONTROL THE
 NARRATIVE?
 I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT,
 BUT IT CERTAINLY RAISES A LOT OF
 QUESTIONS HOW THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL IS DOING THIS.
 HARRY, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 LAYS OUT IN HIS LETTER THAT
 INFORMATION WILL BE REDACTED
 FROM THE PORT.
 IT INCLUDES TERLT THAT BY LAW
 THAT CANNOT BE MADE PUBLIC, THAT
 POTENTIALLY COMPROMISES SOURCES
 AND METHODS, THAT COULD AFFECT
 ONGOING MATTERS AND ANYTHING
 THAT WOULD INFRINGE ON THE
 PRIVACY OF THIRD PARTIES.
 DOES ANYTHING STAND OUT TO YOU
 AS SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR IN THAT
 LIST?
 YEAH.
 FIRST, I MEAN IT'S A VERY WELL
 CRAFTED LETTER.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE HE IS BEING
 COOPERATIVE, BUT IT IS REALLY
 SETTING UP FOR A BATTLE ROYALE.
 THE FIRST CATEGORY IS THE MOST
 IMPORTANT.
 NADLER IS SAYING, WE SHOULD GET
 EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE GRAND
 JURY, BUT WHAT HE IS REALLY
 RELYING ON IS PRIOR CASES THAT
 GIVE EXTRA AUTHORITY TO THE
 COURT.
 YOU CAN BET THAT THE DEPARTMENT
 OF JUSTICE AND BILL BARR ARE
 GOING TO SAY THAT'S NOT UNDER
 THE LAW.
 UNDER THE LAW, WE JUST HAVE TO
 GO WITH THE EXCEPTIONS
 DELINEATED IN THIS SPECIFIC
 RULE.
 NONE OF THEM IS CONGRESS IN AN
 IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.
 SORRY, GUYS, BUT THOSE
 REDACTIONS ARE GOING TO STAND.
 THAT'S THE BIGGEST CATEGORY.
 THE LAST CATEGORY STANDS OUT
 BECAUSE IT'S NEW AND KIND OF
 AMORPHOUS.
 WHAT DOES UNDULY MEAN?
 WHAT DOES PERIPHERAL MEAN?
 THE SECOND AND THIRD CATEGORIES,
 I THINK, YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM
 THAT.
 NATIONAL SECURITY STUFF,
 CERTAINLY THAT MATTERS.
 AND ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS,
 CERTAINLY THAT MATTERS.
 BUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE
 THE BIG BATTLE IS THIS FIRST
 POINT AND NADLER'S GOING TO BE
 VERY UPSET, WANT THE DEPARTMENT
 TO GO FORWARD AND DO SOMETHING
 TOGETHER WITH HIM IN THE COURT.
 IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.
 I WONDER, GARRETT -- SO BARR
 SAYS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER
 IS ASSISTING HIS TEAM IN THIS
 REDACTION PROCESS.
 I WONDER HOW SIGNIFICANT IS
 THAT?
 DOES THAT GIVE BARR SOME COVER
 HERE?
 POTENTIALLY.
 BUT LET'S REMEMBER SORT OF ONE
 BIG OVERARCHING THING.
 IT'S NOT LIKE BOB MUELLER DIDN'T
 KNOW THAT THESE WERE CONCERNS AS
 HE WAS WRITING THIS REPORT.
 IT'S NOT THAT, YOU KNOW, HE
 TURNED OVER THIS REPORT LAST
 FRIDAY AND BILL BARR IS FLIPPING
 THROUGH IT, AND HE GOES, OH,
 BOB, YOU USED ALL THIS GRAND
 JURY TESTIMONY AND INTELLIGENCE
 SOURCES AND METHODS.
 WE CAN'T RELEASE THIS.
 LIKE OBVIOUSLY BOB MUELLER'S
 TEAM HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT
 THIS AND WORKING THROUGH THESE
 ISSUES FOR MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS.
 I MEAN THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH
 THIS PROCESS TO RELEASE
 INTELLIGENCE SIGNALS,
 INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION IN THE
 IRA AND GRU INDICTMENTS.
 THERE'S A GOOD PROCESS INSIDE OF
 GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THOSE TYPES
 OF THINGS PART OF COURT
 PROCEEDINGS.
 AND WE'VE SEEN IN WATERGATE, AND
 WE SAW IN WHITEWATER AND THE KEN
 STARR REPORT SORT OF GRAND
 JURIES AGREE TO HAND OVER THEIR
 INFORMATION TO CONGRESS.
 SO THERE IS PROCESS FOR THIS,
 AND MUELLER HAS PROBABLY BEEN
 THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS.
 AND SORT OF AS MATT WAS SAYING,
 IT'S WEIRD TO ME THAT SORT OF
 THEY'RE PRETENDING AS IF THESE
 ARE BRAND-NEW ISSUES THAT NO ONE
 HAD THOUGHT ABOUT PRIOR TO LAST
 FRIDAY.
 MATTHEW, BARR --
 CAN I --
 GO FOR IT.
 THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE, BUT
 NOW BARR IS IN CHARGE, AND
 MUELLER WILL DEFER ON THE
 MATTER.
 SO HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT
 WOULD BE RELEASED, BUT BARR IS
 GOING TO SAY THAT THAT'S NOT HOW
 WE, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
 INTERPRET THE RULE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 MORE FROM THE LETTER, MATTHEW.
 THIS IS FOR YOU.
 ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT WOULD
 HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT
 PRIVILEGE OVER CERTAIN PARTS OF
 THE REPORT, HE HAS STATED
 PUBLICLY HE INTENDS TO DEFER TO
 ME, AND ACCORDINGLY THERE ARE NO
 PLANS TO SUBMIT THE REPORT TO
 THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A PRIVILEGE
 REVIEW.
 BUT TONIGHT THE PRENT
 TWEETED ON THE REPORT SAYING NO
 MATTER WHAT THEY GIVE DEMOCRATS,
 IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH.
 AND MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TAKE
 OUR VICTORY AND SAY NO.
 WE'VE GOT A COUNTRY TO RUN.
 DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
 STILL PLANNING TO DEFER TO BARR
 HERE?
 DOES HE REALLY WANT THE REPORT
 OUT?
 YOU KNOW, I'VE STOPPED TRYING
 TO PREDICT WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S
 THINKING FROM HIS TWEETS.
 IT'S JUST A LOSING GAME.
 I DO SUSPECT THERE ARE PEOPLE
 AROUND THE PRESIDENT, LIKE I
 SAID BEFORE, WHO KNOW THERE ARE
 GOING TO BE DETAILS IN THIS
 REPORT THAT ARE NOT GOING TO
 LOOK GREAT, THAT MAYBE THEY
 DIDN'T AMOUNT TO A CRIME.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, AS WE'VE DETAILED
 IN MANY STORIES OVER THE YEARS
 THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CHALLENGED IN
 THE LAST TWO YEARS OF CONTACTS,
 OF BEING AT THE VERY LEAST
 COLLUSION-CURIOUS, AND THAT'S
 NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT IN A
 PUBLIC SETTING.
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
 HERE.
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
 HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.
 WE'VE GOT A LOT OF
 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
 MUELLER REPORT, ESPECIALLY WHEN
 IT COMES TO THE PRESIDENT'S TIES
 TO RUSSIA.
 WE'RE GOING TO BREAK DOWN THOSE
 QUESTIONS WITH THE FORMER
 DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
 INTELLIGENCE, JAMES CLAPPER.'S .
         <i> It's not small.</i>
  <i> But it's not just big either.</i>
   <i> It's the kind of big where</i>   <i> you'll never have to ask,</i>
      <i> "Should I scooch up?"</i>
        <i> It's big that looks</i>           <i> at a sunroof</i>
    <i> and wonders why it can't</i>    <i> just be most of the roof.</i>
     <i> It's big that's better</i>
  <i> because we built it that way.</i>
          <i> The spacious,</i>  <i> 121 cubic feet of cargo space</i>
        <i> Ford Expedition.</i>
  <i> There are a lot of snack bars</i>
           <i> out there.</i>

 The day after chemo
 might mean a trip back to the doctor's office
         just for a shot.
      But why go back there
      when you can stay home
       with Neulasta Onpro?
   Strong chemo can put you at    risk of serious infection.
     In a key study Neulasta  reduced the risk of infection
         from 17% to 1%,
         a 94% decrease.
    Neulasta Onpro is designed       to deliver Neulasta
       the day after chemo
   and is used by most pa today.
     Neulasta is for certain         cancer patients
  receiving strong chemotherapy.
  Do not take Neulasta if you're          allergic to it
    or Neupogen (filgrastim).
     An incomplete dose could     increase infection risk.

 IN HIS LETTER TODAY, ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR LAID
 OUT THE KINDS OF INFORMATION
 THAT HE IS WORKING TO REDACT
 FROM RELEASING THE MUELLER
 REPORT -- BEFORE RELEASING THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 HE SAYS SOME OF THOSE REDACTIONS
 COULD INCLUDE SENSITIVE
 INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION, BUT
 ARE CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN
 PUBLIC ENTITLED TO SEE THAT
 INFORMATION?
 JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS IS THE
 FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
 INTELLIGENCE, MR. JAMES CLAPPER.
 DIRECTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS THAT
 HE IS IN THE PROCESS OF
 IDENTIFYING POTENTIALLY
 COMPROMISING, SENSITIVE SOURCES
 AND METHODS TO REDACT FROM THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION COULD
 THAT INCLUDE?
 WELL, DON, I WOULD TAKE A CUE
 FROM THE TWO KEY INDICTMENTS, AT
 LEAST FOR ME, THAT MUELLER
 ISSUED IN FEBRUARY AND JULY OF
 LAST YEAR.
 THE ONE IN FEBRUARY WAS THE
 INTERNET -- ABOUT THE INTERNET
 RESEARCH AGENCY, AND THE ONE IN
 JULY WAS ABOUT THE GRU OFFICERS,
 THE RUSSIAN MILITARY
 INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, AND
 INCLUDED INDICTMENTS OF 12 GRU
 OFFICERS.
 AND I WAS REALLY TAKEN ABACK BY
 THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THOSE TWO
 INDICTMENTS.
 A LOT OF FIDELITY, WHICH KIND OF
 SURPRISED ME.
 NOW, IF THAT'S THE BAR THAT'S
 USED, I DON'T THINK -- AND I
 THINK THIS IS ONE CASE THAT
 CALLS FOR A VERY LIBERAL
 INTERPRETATION OF PROTECTING
 SOURCES AND METHODS.
 AND SO IF THIS REPORT IS 400
 PAGES LONG, I WOULD EXPECT AND
 HOPE THAT MUCH OF IT IS ABOUT
 THE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE, WHICH
 APART FROM THE PRESIDENT'S
 CULPABILITY FOR COLLUSION OR
 OBSTRUCTION, TO ME, WHAT IS A
 HUGE ISSUE HERE, HUGELY
 IMPORTANT, IS THE RUSSIAN
 INTERFERENCE IN OUR POLITICAL
 PROCESS, AND IT'S MY GREAT HOPE
 THAT THE REDACTION RULES WILL BE
 VERY LIGHTLY APPLIED AT LEAST
 WHEN IT COMES TO
 INTELLIGENCE-RELATED DATA
 BECAUSE I THINK THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO SEE THAT.
 AND IF THOSE TWO INDICTMENTS ARE
 AN INDICATOR, THEN I WOULD
 EXPECT THIS TO BE A PRETTY
 DEVASTATING INDICTMENT OF THE
 RUSSIANS, WHICH I THINK IS QUITE
 IMPORTANT.
 INTERESTING.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
 COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ASPECT OF
 MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION.
 BUT NO MENTION OF IT IN BARR'S
 LETTER TO CONGRESS OF PRINCIPAL
 CONCLUSIONS.
 WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT
 INVESTIGATION STANDS, DIRECTOR?
 I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW, AND
 THAT, BY THE WAY, IS ANOTHER
 REASON WHY I PERSONALLY AM
 EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN READING
 AS MUCH OF THE MUELLER REPORT AS
 WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE
 PUBLICLY, BECAUSE HOPEFULLY IT
 WOULD CAST SOME LIGHT ON, FOR
 EXAMPLE, THE PRESIDENT'S
 INEXPLICABLE DEFERENCE TO
 VLADIMIR PUTIN AND WHY -- YOU
 KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS
 POTENTIAL THERE FOR THAT
 RELATIONSHIP AND THE DEMEANOR,
 THE MANNER OF IT AFFECTING U.S.
 POLICY.
 AND SO I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THE
 STATE OF PLAY OF THE
 COUNTERINTELLIGENCE
 INVESTIGATION AND WHETHER THAT
 HAS BEEN SUBSUMED OR WAS
 SUBSUMED IN THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION.
 I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.
 THAT'S WHAT SALARY YATES
 PUBLISHED IN HER OP-ED.
 YES, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS
 QUITE GOOD, AND I THINK THERE IS
 A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIMENSION
 HERE.
 WE WANT TO PUT IT UP.
 LET'S PUT IT UP.
 WHY WAS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
 WILLING TO ALLOW THE HELP OF ONE
 OF THE COUNTRY'S FOREMOST
 GEOPOLITICAL ADVERSARIES RATHER
 THAN REPORT THE OVERTURES TO LAW
 ENFORCEMENT.
 AND AS IMPORTANTLY, DOES THE
 ROLE THAT THE RUSSIANS PLAYED IN
 HIS ELECTION HAVE ANY BEARING ON
 TRUMP'S CURRENT APPROACH TOWARDS
 RUSSIA?
 WELL, EXACTLY.
 THAT'S THE POINT.
 NOW, THAT WOULD BE AN ARGUMENT
 FOR SUSTAINING A
 COUNTERINTELLIGENCE
 INVESTIGATION.
 THAT, AGAIN, IS ANOTHER REASON
 WHY THE REVELATION, THE
 TRANSPARENCY IS SO IMPORTANT
 WITH THE CONGRESS AND WITH THE
 PUBLIC, WHETHER IT WILL CAST
 LIGHT ON THAT DIMENSION ALONE,
 YOU KNOW, THE
 COUNTERINTELLIGENCE IMPLICATIONS
 AND WHETHER THERE ARE STILL
 CONCERNS.
 MM-HMM.
 I THOUGHT -- I HAVE TO SAY,
 ADAM SCHIFF'S LITANY IN RESPONSE
 TO THE REPUBLICAN LETTER
 DEMANDING HE RESIGN AS CHAIRMAN
 OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE FOR
 INTELLIGENCE, IT'S NOT OKAY, I
 THOUGHT WAS A PRETTY COMPELLING
 LITANY OF WHY THERE'S SO MUCH
 CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR
 COLLUSION.
 MAYBE IT DIDN'T REACH THE
 EVIDENTIARY BAR FOR CONSPIRACY,
 BUT THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, A GREAT
 DEAL OF CONCERN AND SUSPICION
 ABOUT THAT.
 AND THAT WAS EVIDENT AT THE END
 OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
 WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY
 WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT THERE WAS
 A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT IT.
 SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS, IT IS
 SO IMPORTANT THAT AS MUCH OF
 THIS REPORT AS POSSIBLE BE MADE
 PUBLIC.
 DIRECTOR, THANK YOU.
 I APPRECIATE IT.
 THANKS, DON.

 JERRY NADLER SAYS THE APRIL 2nd
 DEADLINE FOR THE MUELLER REPORT

 ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR SAYS IT WILL TAKE UNTIL MID-APRIL TO
 COMPLETE REDACTIONS TO ROBERT
 MUELLER'S FULL REPORT.
 THE HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN
 JERRY NADLER SAYS THAT'S NOT
 GOOD ENOUGH.
 LET'S DISCUSS NOW.
 CONGRESSMAN STEVE COHEN IS HERE.
 HE'S A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE.
 THANK YOU.
 APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US.
 CHAIRMAN NADLER RESPONDED TO
 BARR'S LETTER SAYING THAT APRIL
 2nd, THAT DEADLINE FOR TURNING
 OVER THE REPORT WITHOUT
 REDACTIONS, THAT IT STILL
 STANDS.
 AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE
 JUDICIARY, HOW DO YOU THINK
 DEMOCRATS PROCEED IF BARR MISSES
 THAT DEADLINE?
 WELL, I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT
 WE DIDN'T MAKE IT APRIL 1
 BECAUSE HE'D HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
 MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ALL OF US.
 AND I SUSPECT THAT'S WHAT BARR
 IS DOING AND TRUMP'S DOING, TO
 TRY TO MAKE A FOOL OUT OF
 CONGRESS AND A FOOL OUT OF THE
 AMERICAN PUBLIC.
 THE WHOLE APPOINTMENT, THE
 CHARADE OF GETTING THE REPORT
 AND ANALYZING IT IS GOING ON, I
 THINK THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE
 REPORT BY APRIL 2nd.
 I SUPPORT CHAIRMAN NADLER.
 THE COMMITTEE WILL SUPPORT HIM,
 AND I THINK WE'LL PROCEED WITH
 THE NEXT ACTION, WHICH I SUSPECT
 WILL BE A SUBPOENA.
 BUT WE NEED TO BE STRONG AND
 FIRM.
 WE NEED TO SEE THE ENTIRE
 REPORT, AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
 DESERVES TO SEE THE ENTIRE
 REPORT BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY'S
 SECURITY VIS-Á-VIS RUSSIA, WHO
 WANTS TO BE THE SOVIET UNION
 AGAIN, IS SOMEWHAT IN JEOPARDY.
 WE'VE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO SEEMS
 TO BE SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH KIM
 JONG-UN AND VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT
 HE CAN'T SEE THE GOODNESS OF HIS
 OWN PEOPLE.
 ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IN
 MAKING MUELLER'S REPORT PUBLIC
 IS THE SECRET GRAND JURY
 MATERIAL.
 NADLER SUGGESTED THAT BARR
 SHOULD BE WORKING WITH THE
 CONGRESS AND THE COURTS TO GET
 THE MATERIAL RELEASED.
 WHY ISN'T THAT HAPPENING?
 BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT IT
 RELEASED.
 THEY WANT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT
 RELEASED BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH
 IN THERE THAT WILL BE DAMNING OF
 WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND
 TRIED TO DO AND HIS FAMILY AND
 OTHERS.
 AND THE GRAND JURY TESTIMONY
 WOULD BE RELEASED IN OTHER
 SPECIAL COUNSEL, INDEPENDENT
 COUNSEL CASES.
 THE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS
 WORKED WITH THE COMMITTEES, GONE
 TO THE COURTS, AND THE COURTS
 HAVE ALLOWED THAT MATERIAL TO BE
 GIVEN TO THE CONGRESS.
 AND THE COURT CAN DO IT, AND I
 FEEL SURE THE FEDERAL DISTRICT
 COURT IN WASHINGTON WOULD.
 BUT WHEN NADLER ASKED BARR TO
 HELP HIM WITH THAT AND TO JOIN
 WITH HIM IN MAKING THAT REQUEST,
 HE REFUSED BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
 WANT IT RELEASED.
 IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST
 THE LAW.
 HE DOESN'T WANT IT RELEASED, AND
 HIS JOB IS TO PROTECT DONALD
 TRUMP.
 HE IS DONALD TRUMP'S MAN.
 SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN
 THERE.
 WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OR IF
 THERE'S ANY DAMNING INFORMATION.
 YOU'RE ASSUMING THERE'S DAMNING
 INFORMATION, BUT HERE'S MY
 QUESTION.
 EVERY DAY THAT PASSES, IT ALLOWS
 THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ALLIES TO
 SUBMIT THE NO COLLUSION
 NARRATIVE IN THE PUBLIC
 CONSCIOUSNESS.
 ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THE
 PUBLIC WON'T BE OPEN TO DETAILS
 THAT THE WHOLE REPORT MAY
 REVEAL?
 I THINK A LOT OF THE PUBLIC
 WON'T BE, AND I THINK THAT'S
 WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN A MOVIE,
 AND IT WASN'T A GREAT MOVIE OR
 ANYTHING ALTHOUGH I LOVED IT
 MANY DECADES AGO CALLED "LIBERTY
 VALANCE."
 THEY SAID WHEN THE LEGEND
 BECOMES THE TRUTH, YOU PRINT THE
 LEGEND.
 AND THEY KNOW THAT.
 AS LONG AS THEY CAN MAKE THE
 LEGEND THEIR FALSE NARRATIVE,
 THE TRUTH, IT WILL BECOME WHAT
 IS ACCEPTED AS THE TRUTH.
 THEY WANT TO KEEP IT OUT THERE
 AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.
 THAT'S WHY APRIL 2 IS NOT A GOOD
 DATE.
 THAT'S WHY HE SAYS POSSIBLY MID
 APRIL.
 THEN WITH SO MANY REDACTIONS IT
 WILL BE LIKE SWISS CHEESE.
 THERE'S NOT 400 PAGES OF NO
 COLLUSION, NO COLLUSION, NO
 COLLUSION.
 THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF STUFF
 THAT HAS INFORMATION THAT WILL
 BE DAMNING TO THE PRESIDENT AND
 HIS ADMINISTRATION, AND
 OTHERWISE ROBERT MUELLER WOULD
 NOT HAVE SAID THIS DOES NOT
 EXONERATE THE PRESIDENT.
 AND IF THERE'S SOME MATERIAL IN
 THERE THAT DOES NOT EXONERATE
 HIM, THEY DON'T WANT US TO SEE
 IT.
 IT'S PROBABLY GRAND JURY
 TESTIMONY, OR IT'S EVIDENCE WAS
 THE STATEMENT THAT THEY WOULD
 NOT RELEASE MATERIAL THAT
 WOULD -- INFORMATION THAT COULD
 AFFECT THE PERSONAL PRIVACY AND
 REPUTATIONAL INTEREST OF
 PERIPHERAL THIRD PARTIES.
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHO THE
 PERIPHERAL THIRD PARTIES IS, BUT
 I SUSPECT IT'S DONALD TRUMP JR.
 AND ERIC AND JAVANKA.
 YOU THINK THAT'S IT WITH HIS
 FAMILY.
 WE SHALL SEE AGAIN.
 WE DON'T KNOW, BUT A 400-PAGE
 LETTER, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN
 THERE.
 YOU DON'T KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW
 THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DESERVES TO
 SEE IT.
 WE'VE SEEN THE ENTIRE RESULTS OF
 WACO, WHICH WAS THE ONLY THING
 UNDER THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 STATUTE IN THE PAST.
 THE INDEPENDENT PROSECUTORS,
 JAWORSKI AND KEN STARR REPORTS
 WERE GIVEN STRAIGHT TO CONGRESS.
 THE U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE UNITED
 STATES ATTORNEY GENERALS DIDN'T
 JUMP IN AND GIVE THEIR
 CONCLUSIONS OR OPINIONS TO TRY
 TO SET A NARRATIVE AND TO
 INTERFERE WITH HOW THE PUBLIC
 WOULD INTERPRET IT.
 THIS IS VERY UNIQUE.
 IT'S VERY DAMAGING.
 YOU KNOW WHO BENEFITS FROM THIS?
 TWO GROUPS BENEFIT FROM THIS.
 DONALD TRUMP AND HIS PEOPLE AND
 RUSSIA.
 RUSSIA WANTS PEOPLE TO NOT
 BELIEVE IN THE UNITED STATES
 GOVERNMENT AND DEMOCRACY.
 THEY WANT TO DESTROY DEMOCRACY.
 THAT'S WHY THEY INTERFERED IN
 OUR ELECTIONS.
 THAT'S WHY THEY TRIED TO
 INTERFERE IN ELECTIONS ALL OVER
 EUROPE AND AROUND THE WORLD, IS
 BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE
 DEMOCRACY AND THEY WANT TO
 DESTROY IT.
 AND ANYTHING THAT HURTS IT HELPS
 THE RUSSIANS.
 AND THIS HAS HURT DEMOCRACY AND
 PEOPLE THINKING THAT THE
 GOVERNMENT IS TRANSPARENT, AND
 THEY ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO
 SEE WHAT IS WORK PRODUCT
 CONCERNING THEIR PRESIDENT AND
 ANY INTEREST HE MIGHT HAVE HAD
 WITH RUSSIA AND WHY HE IS SO
 SUBORDINATE TO VLADIMIR PUTIN.
 CONGRESSMAN COHEN, THANK YOU
 FOR YOUR TIME, SIR.
 TAKE CARE, DON.
 GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 HE SERVED HIS TIME, WAS FREE
 FOR MORE THAN 12 YEARS, AND WAS
 SUDDENLY THREATENED WITH A
 RETURN TO PRISON OVER A LEGAL
 MIXUP.
 NOW DEMET ANDERSON N

  Choosing my car insurance was    the easiest decision ever.
      I switched to GEICO and          saved hundreds.
           That's a win.
       But it's not the only        reason I switched.
  GEICO's a company I can trust,
    with over 75 years of great       savings and service.

       Now that's a win-win.

     Do your asthma symptoms       ever hold you back?■ ■
     About 50% of people with          severe asthma
    have too many cells called   eosinophils in their lungs.
      Eosinophils are a key     cause of severe asthma.
  FASENRA is designed to target     and remove these cells.
      FASENRA is an add-on     injection for people 12
       and up with asthma      driven by eosinophils.
     FASENRA is not a rescue             medicine
           or for other     eosinophilic conditions.
    is proven to help  prevent severe asthma attacks,
    imprFASENRA may cause  canor       allections.
 ■Get help right away if youg of
   face, mouth, and tongue, or        trouble breathing.
      Don't stop your asthma            treatments
        unless your doctor          tells you to.
  Tedoctor if you have a       parasitic infection
     or your asthma worsens.
   Headache and sore throat may             occur.
    Haven't you missed enough?
    Ask an asthma specialist          about FASENRA.

         AstraZeneca may        be able to help.
 WELL, LAST NIGHT WE TOLD YOU ABOUT DEMETRIUS ANDERSON.
 HE DID HIS TIME.
 HE TURNED HIS LIFE AROUND AND
 AFTER MORE THAN 12 YEARS OF
 FREEDOM, HE WAS THREATENED WITH
 A RETURN TO PRISON ALL BECAUSE
 OF A LEGAL MIXUP.
 WELL, TONIGHT WE HAVE AN UPDATE.
 JOINING ME NOW IS DEMETRIUS
 ANDERSON AND HIS ATTORNEY,
 MICHAEL DOLAN.
 ALSO CNN'S VAN JONES.
 GENTLEMEN,EVENING.@H FOR JOININ
 US.
 LET'S GO TO THE ATTORNEY FIRST.
 SO YOUAVE SOME NEWS ABOUT
 DEMETRIUS' CASE.
 CAN YOU SHARE IT WITH US?
 YES.
 I SPOKE TO THE BUREAU OF PRISONS
 TODAY, THE COMMUTATION
 DEPARTMENT AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY
 FROM THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF
 PENNSYLVANIA.
 THEY BOTH CONFIRMED THAT
 DEMETRIUS IS RECEIVING CREDIT
 FOR HIS TIME AT LIBERTY, AND
 THEREFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
 CONSIDERS HIS 16-MONTH SENTENCE
 SERVED.
 ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT THIS
 IS ALL RESOLVED?
 IS THERE A RISK OF THIS, THAT IT
 COULD BE CHANGED?
 LOOK, I'LL FEEL MUCH MORE
 COMFORTABLE WHEN I GET THAT IN
 WRITING HOPEFULLY ON MONDAY.
 BUT THE NEWS I GOT LATE TODAY,
 GETTING IT FROM THOSE TWO
 SOURCES, I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT
 THAT THAT RISK IS GONE.
 YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN
 THE U.S. MARSHAL TO MEET NINE
 DAYS AGO, LOST 15 POUNDS, THE
 STRESS IS EXTRAORDINARY FOR YOU.
 HOW ARE YOU FEELING TONIGHT WITH
 THIS INFORMATION?
 I'M FEELING GRATEFUL,
 OVERJOYED, TOTALLY OVERJOYED.
 AND FEELING LIKE MY FAITH.
 YOU SEEM CAUTIOUS THOUGH.
 I AM BECAUSE I'M CAUTIOUS
 ONLY FOR THE FACT THAT I NEED TO
 SEE IT IN WRITING.
 BECAUSE I'VE SEEN MY RELEASE
 PAPERS WRITTEN IN 2006 AND CAME
 HOME, SO I WOULD NEED TO SEE
 THAT IN WRITING TO FEEL 100%
 THAT WHAT I EXPERIENCED LAST
 WEEK WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
 BEN JONES, YOU BROUGHT THE
 GIVER REACTION, R.
 WHEN WE FIGHT, WEWIN.
 THIS BROTHER DESERVED EVERYTHING
 THAT WAS DONE FOR HIM.
 AFTER YOUR SHOW, DON, IT WAS
 CRAZY.
 I MEAN, SOCIAL MEDIA WENT CRAZY,
 CONGRESS PEOPLE WERE CALLING,
 PEOPLE SAYING THIS COULD NOT
 HAPPEN TO THIS YOUNG MAN.
 IT'S TERRIBLE.
 HOW COULD YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO
 DOES WHAT WE SAY DO, MADE A
 MISTAKE BUT 13 YEARS, HE'S DONE
 PERFECT, DONE PERFECT AND WITH
 THIS TSUNAMI OF PUBLIC SUPPORT
 FOR THIS YOUNG MAN.
 WHEN WE FIGHT, WE WIN.
 SO THE FEDERAL DEFENDERS NEED A
 ROUND OF APPLAUSE.
 THE PROSECUTOR CAME TO THE
 TABLE.
 THE BUREAU OF PRISON.
 I MEAN, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE WHAT
 HAPPENED.
 AND LISTEN, WE HAVE TO DO THIS
 EVERY TIME WE HEAR ABOUT
 INJUSTICE.
 WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S AN
 ASSET FOR THE COMMUNITY, WE'LL
 FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL.
 THIS IS A VICTORY TO INSPIRE
 PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IF
 THEY COME AFTER SOMEBODY ELSE,
 QUIT GOING IN THE DRAWER TRYING
 TO FINEOPLE TO PUT BACK
 IN PRISON.
 LIKE DON'TE ENOUGH PEOPLE
 IN ON.
 ISN'T THIS WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO
 HAPPEN WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 SYSTEM?
 IF SOMEONE WITH REST LUGS AND
 THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY, THEY
 SHOULD COME OUT AND WORK TO
 REFORM THEIR LIVES?
 DON, I TRUST YOU TO KEEP THE
 SPOTLIGHT ON.
 I TRUST Dp/p#p/■/TAND
 STRONG AND HIS ATTORNEYS TO
 STAND WITH HIM AND ALL THE ROOTS
 THAT HAVE COME AROUND.
 ONCE IT'S ON PAPER, I WANT TO
 LOOK AND HOLD UP TO THE LIGHT.
 MAKE SURE THERE'S NO INVISIBLE
 LEAK ON THERE BUT MOVEMENT WINS.
 THAT'S WHAT I WANT PEOPLE TO
 UNDERS
 WE CAN WALK WITH YOUR HEAD HELD
 HIGH.
 THIS 48 HOURS OF COMPLETE
 TURNAROUND OF THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION CAME TO THE
 TABLE, FEDERAL DEFENDERS CAME TO
 THu> PREACHERS CAME TO THE
 TABLE, PEOPLE CAME TO THE TABLE,
 DON, AFTER YOUR SHOW AND MADE A
 POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN SUCH A
 SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
 IT WASINGub MEububububub ME ASK.
 YOU TRUST, YOU TALK ABOUT THE
 PEOPLE YOU TRUST AND THIS
 PLATFORM IS ONE OF THEM.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.
 BUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO
 PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING TO
 SOMEONE ELSE?
 IS IT AWARENESS?
 IS IT LAWS?
 WHAT?
 WELL, LOOK.
 I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, WE'VE GOT TO
 CHANGE THE LAWS.
 I'M PROUD TO BE THE CEO OF THE
 REFORM ALICELIANCE.
 DON, YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING THE
 SPOTLIGHT ON THIS FOR YEARS AND
 YEARS.
 PEOPLE KNOW OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 SYSTEM HAS GOT TO BE FIXED BUT
 DOESN'T BECOME REAL TO PEOPLE
 UNTIL THEY SEE A PERSON LIKE
 THNG
 THROUGH THE SOCK DRAWER, LOOKING
 UP FILING CABINETS, HOW TO PUT
 MORE PEOPLE IN PRISON.
 WE ALREADY HAVE THE BIGGEST
 PRISON POPULATION IN THE WORLD,
 DON.
 WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN■■■■■■■■ N
 OUR LITTLE COUNTRY THAN CHINA
 WITH A BILv■v■ PEOPLE.
 FIND GOOD FOLKS TO GIVE THEM A
 CHANCE TO COME HOME AND WELLá■R/
 u/u/■■■■ A PROOF POINTu#
  WHEN WE
 WORK ACROSS PARTY LINES,
 REPUBLICANS CAME AND DEMOCRATS
 CAME.
 WHEN WE COME TOGETHER ACROSS
 PARTY LINES, WE CAN STOP
 INJUSTICE FROM HAPPENING.
 IT TAKES PEOPLE LIKE YOU, DON.
 YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE TO RUSH
 THIS TO THE AIR.
 WE APPRECIATE THAT.
 BUT THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.
 ALL IT WAS WAS■ THE
 TRUTH.
 ONCE YOU HEAR THE TRUTH, NOT
 GOING TO LET THIS HAPPEN.LAS
 STILL BELIEVE IN THE JUDICIAL
 SYSTEM.
 WHAT IS BEHIND THAT BELIEF?
 MY MOTHER ALWAYS BELIEVED IN
 THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
 ALWAYS TOLD ME TO RESPECT IT.
 SO WHEN I DID GET IN TROUBLE, IT
 WAS REALLY MORE FOR ME, FOR HER
 TO TURN MY LIFE AROUND WHEN I
 CAME HOME BECAUSE OF THE PAIN
 I'VE SEEN AND I CAUSED HER WHEN
 I HAD GOT IN TROUBLE.
 I MADE A VOW NOT TO DO IT AGAIN,
 FOR HER, AND BY TURNING MY LIFE
 AROUND, IT, YOU KNOW, BROUGHT
 HER JOY.
 BUT WHAT I WENT THROUGH LAST
 WEEK WAS JUST RIDICULOUS BECAUSE
 WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS, I
 LOST HER, MY STEPFATHER AND MY
 LITTLE SISTER TO THE HANDS OF MY
 BROTHER.
 WHICH I'M IN THERAPY FOR NOW.
 SO WHEN THAT HAPPENED TO ME,
 JUST RECENTLY LAST WEEK, WHEN IT
 CAME FOR ME AND I KNOW I DIDN'T
 EVEN DO ANYTHING WRONG, I DIDN'T
 KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 I WAS SUICIDAL, COULDN'T EAT.
 BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND
 THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY ANSWER
 WHEN IT CAME, YOU KNOW, BUSTING
 IN MY HOME LIKE THAT.

           With moderate    to severe Crohn's disease,
       I was there, just not   always where I needed to be.
          Is she alright?
            I hope so.
     So I talked to my doctor           about HUMIRA.
  I learned HUMIRA is for people      who still have symptoms
        of Crohn's disease  after trying other medications.
         And the majority        of people on HUMIRA
  saw significant symptom relief    and many achieved remission
     in as little as 4 weeks.

    Ask your gastroenterologist           about HUMIRA.
           With HUMIRA,      remission is possible.
