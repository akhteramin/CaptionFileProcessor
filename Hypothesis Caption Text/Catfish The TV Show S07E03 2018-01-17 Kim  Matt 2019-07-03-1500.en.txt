- All right, we're back. 
- All right. So yesterday, we did some research. 
- We don't know what to make of this. 
- We're a little befuddled. Okay, so here's where we started. So the first thing we found when we searched his number... Bingo. 
- Look what we got. Number for five years. Comes back to a Matt [bleep]. 
- This never happens. It's in Florida, which is where he says he lives, so this was kind of a good surprise, and he also has a Twitter. Then there's some pictures back from 2012 that look like they're of him. This would have been the Matt that you sort of started talking to. 
- Then we looked up his URL. The first one was oa bunchh a PlentyOfFish account that's up; I don't know how or when it was last active. For a guy who lives in Kissimmee, 21 years old, 6'2. There's also this photo. It could be him. 
- I'm not sure if I should even make a comment. [laughs] <i> [Music] [Music]</i> I'm not sure what to say. 
- What's--are you upset? I can't tell... 
- Do you mind if I take a second? 
- Sure. Yeah. Take as much time as you need. <i> [tense music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> You all right? 
- Mm-hmm. <i> [Music] [Music]</i>
