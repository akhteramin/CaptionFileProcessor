All right, we're back.

All right.
So yesterday, we did some research.

We don't know what to make of this.

We're a little befuddled.
Okay, so here's where we started.
So the first thing we found when we searched his number...
Bingo.

Look what we got.
Number for five years.
Comes back to a Matt [bleep].

This never happens.
It's in Florida, which is where he says he lives, so this was kind of a good surprise, and he also has a Twitter.
Then there's some pictures back from 2012 that look like they're of him.
This would have been the Matt that you sort of started talking to.

Then we looked up his URL.
The first one was oa bunchh a PlentyOfFish account that's up; I don't know how or when it was last active.
For a guy who lives in Kissimmee, 21 years old, 6'2.
There's also this photo.
It could be him.

I'm not sure if I should even make a comment.
[laughs]  [Music] [Music] I'm not sure what to say.

What's--are you upset? I can't tell...

Do you mind if I take a second? 
Sure.
Yeah.
Take as much time as you need.
