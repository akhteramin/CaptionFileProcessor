 SO I GET IT. AND SOMETIMES I WATCH HIM FROM
 PLAY TO PLAY AND BE LIKE, BEST
 PLAYER EVER.
 AND THE VERY NEXT PLAY I THINK,
 YOU CAN'T WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP
 WITH THIS GUY.
 I WANT THE SWINGS.
 HE IS THE TYPE OF DUDE THAT
 COULD BE VOTED MOST UNDERRATED
 AND OVERRATED IN THE SAME POLL.
 HE IS THAT KIND OF PLAYER.
 MOLLY: HOW ABOUT THIS, GUYS?
 WE ASKED EVERYONE AT HOME DOES
 AARON RODGERS HAVE SOMETHING HE
 NEEDS TO PROVE NEXT SEASON?
 STEPHEN A. SMITH, PERK UP YOUR
 EARS.
 72% SAID YES.

 YOU HAVE SCARS, RIGHT?
 YOU HAVE A SCAR THAT REMINDS
 YOU OF THAT, BUT, YOU KNOW,
 LITTLE A MEMORY, AND DOES IT GO
 AWAY COMPLETE?
 NO, I WISH IT WOULDN'T HAVE
 HAPPENED.
 BUT NOW, IT BOUGHT US A TICKET
 HERE, SO BE IT.
 I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT
 PART, RIGHT AFTER THAT GAME, WE
 ALL REACTED, AND INSTEAD OF,
 YOU KNOW, WE DEFINITELY HAD OUR
 TIME WHERE WE WERE IN OUR
 SHELLS AND UPSET AND WHATNOT.
 BUT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PAST
 THAT AND GET WHERE WE ARE RIGHT
 NOW IS INCREDIBLE.
 CHRIS, LOOKED LIKE YOU
 STOPPED TO TALK TO A COUPLE OF
 YOUR GUYS BEFORE THEY WALK OFF
 THE FLOOR.
 WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM
 AFTER THE GAME THERE?
 JUST -MAN, WHEW.
 JUST TOLD THEM I LOVED THEM.
 YOU KNOW, OUR RELATIONSHIP IS
 JUST GETTING STARTED.
 I'LL BE WITH THOSE GUYS AT
 THEIR WEDDINGS ONE DAY, AND
 HOPEFUL WHEN WILL THEIR KIDS
 GET BORN.
 DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO TALK
 THEM OUT OF GETTING INTO
 COACHING SO THEY DON'T EVER
 FEEL LIKE THIS.
 YOU KNOW, I JUST LOVE THOSE
 GUYS.
 JAY: WELL, DEFENSE WINS
 CHAMPIONSHIPS, AND VIRGINIA IS
 THE FIRST TEAM SINCE THE
 1958-1959 CAL BEARS TO LEAD
 DIVISION I IN SCORING, DEFENSE,
 AND WIN THE TITLE.
 VIRGINIA ONLY ALLOWED THEIR
 OPPONENTS TO SCORE JUST NORTH
 OF 56 POINTS PER GAME, WHICH IS
 THE LOWEST SINCE, WELL, LAST
 YEAR, WHEN THE CAVALIERS HELD
 OPPONENTS TO 54 POINTS PER
 GAME.
 A CELEBRATION, AS YOU CAN SEE.
 THIS WAS THE SCENE
 ■kARLOTTESVILLE AS THEY
 BASKETBALL TITLE IN SCHOOL
 HISTORY.
 CO■HAT.
 THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS
 CELEBRATED AS THEY WATCHED THE
 GAME THERE IN THE ARENA, AND
 THEN THERE WERE THOSE W LIN
  STREETS OF THAT CITY.
 SO, IS THERE■W STILL A
 CELEBRATION ON CAMPUS?
 THAT IS THE QUESTION.
 WE ARE NOW JOINED BY COLLEGE
 SPORTS REPORTER, ED ASCHOFF
 FROM VIRGINIA.
 THE CHAMPIONS WILL BE HOME
 SOMETIME TODAY.
 CAN YOU SET THE SCENE FOR THE
 FEEL CAMPUS, AND WHAT HAPPENS
 NEXT AS THE CHAMPIONS PREPARE
 FOR THE CELEBRATION?
 ED: CARI, AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND
 ME, THE MOOD IS A LITTLE BIT
 MORE SUBDUED NOW COMPARED TO
 LAST NIGHT'S CELEBRATION AT THE
 CORNER.
 BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE
 BIGGEST THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD
 FROM FANS, UTTER JOY AND UTTER
 JUST PEACE OF BEING VIRGINIA
 FANS, CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
 THAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS
 PROGRAM.
 LOSING TO A 16 SEED LAST YEAR
 AS A ONE SEED.
 I TALKED TO A WOMAN LAST NIGHT
 WHO TOLD ME, LOOK, I JUST GOT A
 TEXT MESSAGE FROM A FRIEND WHO
 TOLD ME, REGARDLESS OF THE
 GENDER OF THE BABY I'M GOING TO
 HAVE, I'M NAMING THAT CHILD
 AFTER TONY BENNETT.
 EARLIER, RIGHT BEFORE WE CAME
 ON AIR, WE HEARD A WOMAN IN HER
 CAR BLASTING QUEEN'S "WE ARE
 THE CHAMPIONS," POINTING AT US
 AND SINGING.
 A GUY LAST NIGHT TOLD ME HE WAS
 JUST SO RELIEVED, BECAUSE HE'S
 BEEN AT THIS UNIVERSITY FOR SO
 LONG.
 HE LOOKED AT ME AND JUST SAID,
 10 YEARS WITH TONY BENNETT.
 FINALLY WE HAVE A CHAMPIONSHIP.
 AND I'LL SAY THIS, IT WAS
 PRETTY RAUCOUS LAST NIGHT, BUT
 A GUY AT CONVENIENCE STORE TOLD
 ME THIS CELEBRATION WASN'T
 CLOSE TO BEING AS CRAZY AS IT
 WAS SATURDAY AFTER THEY BEAT
 AUBURN TO GET TO THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP.
 SO I THINK THAT THERE'S SO MUCH
 RELIEF HERE, THERE'S SO MUCH
 EXCITEMENT, BUT THEY ARE JUST
 SO HAPPY TO FINALLY SEE A
 CHAMPIONSHIP IN
 CHARLOTTESVILLE.
 CARI: WE GOT ONE PARTIER BEHIND
 US GIVING YOU A HIGH FIVE IN
 THE BACKGROUND.
 ED: THERE YOU GO.
 A LITTLE BIT MORE.
 CARI: THAT IS OUR ED ASCHOFF.
 ODDS ARE OUT FOR NEXT YEAR, AND
 OUR FRIENDS AT WASTE GATE GIVE
 VIRGINIA A GOOD CHANCE TO
 REPEAT.
 THEY ARE TIED WITH KENTUCKY FOR
 THE BEST ODDS TO WIN THE TITLE.
 THEY'RE FOLLOWED BY DUKE AND
 MICHIGAN STATE AT 8-1.
 AND MICHIGAN WOLVERINES ROUND
 OUT THE TOP FIVE AT 12-1.

 AUGUSTA NATIONAL.
 GROUPING FOR THE FIRST ROUND
 HAVE BEEN RELEASED.
 LET'S STARTS WITH 11:04 A.M.
 TIGER WOODS GOING OUT WITH LEE
 AND JON RAHM.
 ANDY: OBVIOUSLY TIGER HAS
 PLAYED REALLY GOOD GOLF.
 HIS PUTTING HASN'T BEEN UP TO
 SNUFMENT HE'S GOT TO PUTT
 BETTER THIS WEEK.
 I THINK HE WILL.
 BUT JON RAHM, HERE'S A PLAYER
 THAT I THINK EVERY TIME HE
 WALKS ON THIS GOLF COURSE FROM
 NOW UNTIL HE FINISHES PLAYING H.
 MICHAEL: VERY MUCH SO.
 BEHIND THEM, REMEMBER TRYING
 COMPLETE THE CAREER GRAND SLAM.
 ANDY: COULD YOU SAY, WOULD YOU
 THAT I GROUP AGAINST THE REST
 OF THE FIELD?
 YOU MIGHT DO THAT.
 RORY IS PLAYING BEAUTIFULLY.
 WILL HE PUTT WELL ENOUGH TO
 WIN?
 HE'S HAD CHANCES BEFORE, THE
 WAY HE DRIVES THE BALL, HE IS
 THE FAVORITE TO WIN.
 RICKIE PLAYS WELL.
 CA SMITH, PLAYED WELL LAST
 YEAR.
 MICHAEL: IN THE AFTERNOON, TWO
 FORMER WINNERS IN JASON DAY AND
 JUSTIN JOHNSON.
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU LOOKING FOR
 THE FIRST MAJOR.
 ANDY: DUSTIN JOHNSON'S STYLE
 FITS IT BETTER THAN ALMOST
 ANYBODY.
 THE WAY HE DRIVES THE BALL, HIS
 PUTTING, AGAIN, HE'S A LITTLE
 BID COLD WITH IT.
 BUT IF HE'S GOOD, HE'S REALLY
 GOOD.
 MICHAEL: YOU GOT PHIL MICKELSON
 GOING OFF WITH JUSTIN ROSE AND
 JUSTIN THOMAS.
 ANDY: JUSTIN ROSE QUIETLY THE
 NUMBER ONE PLAYER IN THE WORLD.
 BUT IF YOU DID "WHICH JUSTIN
 WOULD YOU TAKE," I LOVE JUSTIN
 THOMAS F. YONG BET ON
 HIM OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS,
 HE'S GOING TO WIN MULTIPLE
 MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS.
 PHIL, EVERY TIME HE DRIVES IN
 HERE, HE THINKS HE CAN WIN.
 MICHAEL: THREE-TIME WINNER HERE
 AT THE MASTERS.
 JORDAN SPIETH LOOKING TO GET
 HIS GAME IN ORDER AGAIN, MAYBE
 WIN A SECOND GREEN JACKET.
 HE WILL PLAY WITH PAUL CASEY
 AND BROOKS KOEPKA.
 ANDY: ALL THE SUDDEN BROOKS
 KOEPKA IS PLAYING GREAT GOLF.
 HE HASN'T PLAYED THAT YET ON
 THIS COURSE, BUT IT FITS HIS
 GAMEERFECTLY.
 JORDAN SPIETH HAS PLAYED BETTER
 HERE THE LAST FIVE YEARS VERSUS
 ANYBODY.
 MICHAEL: BROOKS KOEPKA DID NOT
 PLAY HERE LAST YEAR DUE TO
 INJURY.
 IT'S ONE THING TO PICK SOMEBODY
 YOU THINK IS GOING PLAY WELL,
 AND THEN YOU SEE THE GROUPING.
 HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR
 MINDSET IN WHO YOU LIKE TO WIN?
 ANDY: THESE GUYS ALL PLAY WITH
 EACH OTHER, OR GET PAIRED WITH
 EACH OTHER, EVERY TIME THEY
 PLAY GOLF.
 THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
 I THINK THE KEY IS THAT THEY'RE
 ALL GOING TO BE IN OUR COVERAGE
 LATE THURSDAY AND LATE FRIDAY,
 AND THAT'S THE REAL KEY.
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT IN
 THE MIDDLE OF THIS.
 THEY'RE ALL PLAYING REALLY
 WELL.
 THIS GOLF COURSE FITS THEIR
 GAMES, SO MANY OF THEIR GAMES
 REALLY WELL.
 I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN
 AMAZING THURSDAY AND FRIDAY OF
 GOLF.
 MICHAEL: AS YOU SEE BEHIND US,
 THE PRACTICE AREA HERE CLOSED.
 HOW IS THE WEATHER AFFECTING
 PREPARATION?
 FOR MORE ON THAT, LET'S BRING
 IN OUR GOOD FRIEND, GENE ADRIAN
 WOJNAROWSKI.
 -GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI.
 WHAT'S HAPPENING?
 GENE: IF YOU LOOK AT THE
 WEATHER CHANNEL RADAR THESE
 DAYS, THOSE ARE THE TWO
 DOMINANT COLORS YOU'RE GOING TO
 SEE ON THE SCREEN, GREEN AND
 YELLOW.
 APPEARS THE RAINS MOVE THROUGH,
 RICKIE FOWLER NORMALLY WOULDN'T
 PLAY ON A MONDAY, BUT HE
 DECIDED, AFTER LOOKING AT THE
 FORECAST, TO COME OUT HERE.
 HE PLAYED NINE HOLES BECAUSE HE
 SAW TUESDAY WOULD BE IFFY.
 AND THEN THERE'S TIGER WOODS,
 WHO HOPED TO PLAY NINE HOLES
 BEFORE OR AFTER HIS 1:00 P.M.
 PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY.
 NOW HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLAY
 SOME HOLES, MAYBE AT LEAST GET
 OUT TO THE RANGE AND HIT SOME
 BALLS.
 THEN THERE'S BROOKS KOEPKA, WHO
 WE JUST SAW ON THE LIST.
 NOTHING FAZESIM.
 I'M NOT EVEN SURE HE HAS A
 PULSE.
 HE SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
 THE RAINS DO TO THE
 PREPARATION.
 HE REMINDED ALL OF US IN
 PRESS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING
 THAT AT THE PGA CHAMPIONSHIP
 LAST YEAR, WELL, IT RAINED ON
 TUESDAY.
 IT RAINED AGAIN ON FRIDAY.
 AND&GUESS WHO WON THAT
 TOURNAMENT AND THAT MAJOR.

 That's why we're working on ways          to improve it.

 NEED TOITHER TIE■■& PASS THE
 PISTONSINCEROIT

 AND ■■p
 ç@ ARE TIED WITH THETS4>TW;'T H
 WHICH MAKES THEIR CHANCES OF
  PRETTY SLIM.
 B.P.I. ONLY GIVES THEMG7 1%
 CHANCE TO MAKE IT, WHICH MEANS
 WE ONLY HAVE TWO MORE GAMES TO
 WATCH D. WADE.
 CARI: AND THAT IS A BUMMER.
 MEANWHILE, FROM THE BOTTOM OF
 THE EAST PLAYOFF PICTURE, WE GO
 TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WEST.
 THUNDER-SPURS.
 CLIPPERS FIGHTING FOR SEEDING,
 AND THEY ARE ALL SEPARATED BY
 JUST HALF A GAME.
 IT'S TOUGH OUT HERE.
 THESE TEAMS STILL HAVE A LOT TO
 PLAY FOR IN ORDER TO AVOID
 BEING THE EIGHT SEED AND FACE
 THE WARRIORS IN THE FIRST
 ROUND.
 NO ONE WANTS THE CHAMPS.
 SPEAKING OF THE WEST, FORMER
 LAKER GREAT RICK FOX JOINS ME
 NOW RIGHT NOW ON "COAST TO
 COAST."
 SUCH A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU
 HERE.
 YOU HAVE THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS
 WITH THE LAKERS.
 WE OBJECT -OBVIOUS HAVE THE
 TO START THERE.
 I WANT TO ASK YOU QUITE SIMPLY,
 IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT WENT
 WRONG?
 RICK: HEALTH.
 HEALTH.
 I LOOK BACK AT THE CHRISTMAS
 DAY GAME, AND I KNOW OF
 LEBRON'S INJURY.
 MOMENTUM WAS BUILDING.
 AND THEN HE WAS DOWN.
 HE WAS DOWN FOR A NUMBER OF
 MONTHS.
 WHEN HE RETURNED, I THINK THE
 TRADE DEADLINE ALSO THEN
 CREATED A SITUATION FOR OUR
 YOUNG PLAYERS TO EXPERIENCE
 WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN NBA
 PLAYER PROFESSIONALLY AND
 BUSINESS-WISE.
 SOME OFM HANDLED IT WELL,■@
 OTHERS DIDN'T.
 D I THINK@d■  AOINT, I
 THINK THEOO STRONG,
 AND WE SPIRALED OUT.
 CARI: THE■ WEST IS VERY STRO
 I YOU GAVE SOMELLY
 GOOD REASONS.
 HEALTH IS ONE OF THESE THINGS
 THAT PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT
 WHEN IT COMES TO THE LAKERS.
 IT'S MORE ABOUT THE DRAMA.
 YOU TALK ABOUT THE A.D.
 SITUATION IN TERMS OF THE TRADE
 DEADLINE, BUT THE OTHER DRAMA
 IS LUKE WALTON.
 LET'S STAY RIGHT THERE.
 CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THERE ARE
 SO MANY RUMORS AND PERHAPS
 EXPECTATIONS THAT LUKE WALTON
 WILL LOSE HIS JOB?
 RICK: I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF
 THE EXPECTATIONS.
 THIS IS LOS ANGELES.
 WE UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL OF
 EXCELLENCE THAT IS EXPECTED
 FROM THE FANS AND EXPECTED FROM
 THE ORGANIZATION.
 WE CHASE CHAMPIONSHIPS, AND
 WE'VE FALLEN SHORT.
 I THINK THE IMPROVEMENT MAY BE
 THERE IN THE PLAYERS, IF YOU
 LOOK AT LUKE'S JOB, WHEN IT
 COMES TO NURTURING THOSE GUYS
 AND GROWING THEM.
 BUT RIGHT NOW, IT'S ABOUT BEING
 IN THE PLAYOFFS AND CHASING A
 CHAMPIONSHIP.
 WE'VE FALLEN SHORT AGAIN.
 I UNDERSTAND THE EXPECTATIONS
 THAT COME WITH A COACH AND
 BEING JUDGED AT THE END OF THE
 SEASON, AND IT STARTS WITH THAT
 COACH PROBABLY.
 CARI: IS IT FAIR?
 THAT'S A YES OR NO.
 RICK: I DON'T THINK IT'S --
 LIFE'S NOT FAIR.
 I'LL GO THERE.
 CARI: WELL, THERE YOU GO.
 THAT IS THE ANSWER.
 FOLKS, YOU CAN HEAR AND SEE
 MORE OF RICK FOX ON MORNING
 SHOW "MYSTERIES," A MURDER IN
 MIND PREMIERING THIS SUNDAY ON
 HALLMARK MOVIES AND MYSTERIES.
 RICK FOX, I APPRECIATE YOUR
 TIME AND JOINING US ON "COAST
 TO COAST."
 RICK: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 JAY: CARI, RICK, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH.
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT TODD MCSHAY'S
 GRADE A MOCK DRAFT, MEANING
 THESE ARE THE PLAYERS HE THINKS
 BEST FIT EACH TEAM'S NEEDS, NOT
 THE ONES HE BELIEVES THEY WILL
 NECESSARILY SELECT.
 MCSHAY THINKS THE CARDINALS,
 GIANTS, AND BRONCOS SHOULD GO
 WITH QUARTERBACKS, AND THE
 RAIDERS SHOULD FORTIFY THEIR
 PASS RUSH WITH KENTUCKY'S JOSH
 ALLEN.
 WE ARE JOINED NOW BY THE MAN
 HIMSELF.
 YOU HAVE THREE QUARTERBACKS
 GOING IN THE TOP 10.
 WALK US THROUGH YOUR THOUGHT
 PROCESS ON EACH, STARTING WITH
 KYLER MURRAY AT NUMBER ONE.
 TODD: IT'S A TOUGH CALL,
 BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE
 OUT WHAT THE ORGANIZATION
 NEEDS.
 AND HONESTLY, IF I'M THE
 GENERAL MANAGER AND I'M LOOKING
 AT THIS SITUATION, IF KLIFF
 KINGSBURY COMES IN AND HE WANTS
 THIS QUARTERBACK, I GOT TO GET
 HIM THE QUARTERBACK.
 AND THAT'S REALLY YOUR JOB AS
 RUNNING THE
 DEPARTMENT.
 I THINK HE FITS THE SYSTEM
 WELL.
 JOSH ROSEN COULD WORK.
 I THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERN
 WITH LONG-TERM DURABILITY.
 YOU HAVE THE POINT GUARD
 MENTALITY, LIKE KYLER HAS.
 AND LISTEN, THIS AIR RAID
 DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO HAPPEN.
 HE BRINGS THAT, AND SO THAT'S
 AN EXTRA ELEMENT.
 DWAYNE HASKINS, ANOTHER TOUGH
 ONE TO FIGURE OUT.
 IT'S LIKE EVERY WEEK A
 GUY FALLING, AND THERE'S A GUY
 RISING.
 HASKINS IS THE  POCKET
 PASSER IN THIS DRAFT.
 THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT
  OFIENCE.
 SAME CAN BE SAID FOR KYLER
 BOTH 14 STARTS, COMPARED TO
 DREW LOCK, WHO'S GOT 46.
 BUT THIS GUY, FROM INSIDE THE
 POCKET, YOU GIVE HIM JUST A
 LITTLE BIT OF TIME, HE CAN DICE
 YOU UP.
 AND THEN FINALLY, DREW LOCK TO
 ME IS THE MOST INTRIGUING OF
 ■ THREE, JUST BECAUSE HE'S
 GOT 46■
 HE'S THE MOST EXPERIENCED.
 HIS TAPE IS THE MOST UP AND
 DOWN, THOUGH, THE LEAST
 CONSISTENT IN TERMS OF DECISION
 MAKING AND WITH HIS ACCURAC■■■■
 BUT I THINK WHEN HIS FEET ARE
 RIGHT, HE'S REALLY GOOD IN
 TERMS OF HIS ACCURACY.
 AND THEN THE CONFIDENCE THAT HE
 BRINGS, THE ATHLETICISM HE HAS,
 THE BIG ARM, TEAMS ARE
 SBREEFPLGD IT'S GOING TO BE
 INTERESTING.
 JAY: HE'D BE THE THIRD MISSOURI
 Q.B. TO GO IN THE FIRST ROUND
 AND FIRST SINCE BLAINE GABBERT
 IN 2011.
 TODD: AND THAT WENT WELL.
 JAY: YEAH, I WAS GOING SAY,
 WE'RE NOT JUMPING UP AND DOWN
 OVER THAT ONE.
 THE PACKERS HAVE A PAIR OF
 PICKS IN THE FIRST ROUND.
 YOU HAVE THEM TAKING A COUPLE
 OF PLAY MAKERS TO HELP OUT
 AARON RODGERS.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY SNOW
 MARQUISE BROWN AND IRV SMITH
 JR.?
 TODD: I THINK EVERYONE IS
 SAYING D.J. METCALF BECAUSE
 HE'S A BIGGER GUY.
 HE'S 228 POUNDS, RAN A 4.33 40.
 I UNDERSTAND HE'S A PHYSICAL
 FREAK.
 I JUST THINK THE BETTER
 FOOTBALL PLAYER IS MARQUISE ■OW.
 WHEN I STUDY THE TAPE, SPEED,
 QUICKNESS,■ EXPLOSION, THE
 ABILITY TO WATCH THAT ROUTE, I
  HIS ABILITY TO SEPARATE
 ALSO CREATE AFTER■■ THE CATCH
 MAKES HIM I THINK UNIQUE.
 A LOT OFo; DESEAN JACKSONISM TO
 ■■■O■Q& v ■■,é■
 I KNOWY÷S HE HAS THE LISFRANC
 INJURY.
 BUT TO ME, MARQUISE BROWNING
 WHEN SHE HE'S HEALTHY AND 100%,
 HE'S THE BEST WIDE RECEIVER IN
 THIS CLASS.
 AND THEN IF YOU BRING IN A
 RECEIVER EARLY, GO GET A TIGHT
 ■■■■■■■■■■■■ YOU CAN.
 AND■NK GREEN BAY HAS■■■■/
 GOTTEN TORTUNITY■=■■k■■RITH
 çDS FIRST
 ú# POTENTIALLY IN THIS
 YEAR'S CLASS, IRV SMITH JR.
 MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
 WHAT HE DOES BEST, JAY, IS
 AFTER THE CATCH.
 YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF TIGHT
 ENDS CREATE AS MANY Y
 H AS HE DOES, AND GOAT
 BETTER AND BETTER AS A BLOCKER.
 SO IF IT'S NOT IRV SMITH JR.,
 IT COULD BE HOP KIN SON, FROM
 IOWA, BUT WITH THE 12TH PICK.

 TCHOIP YEAR'S NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP WAS
 DECIDED IN MINNEAPOLIS.
 THAT CITY HAD ITS OWN HOOPS
 HISTORY FROM.

 TO AN INFAMOUS FIGHT BETWEEN
 OHIO STATE AND THE UNIVERSITY
 OF MINNESOTA BACK IN 1972.
 BUT FROM ITS INDOOR ARENAS TO

 CHRIS CONNELLY SHARES THE STORY
 OF AN UNKNOWN BASKETBALL STAR,
 PRINCE.
 YES, THAT ONE.
 THE SYMBOL.
 HE WAS, IN FACT, A 5'2" POINT
 GUARD WHO NEEDED JUST ONE NAME
 TO CONQUER THE WORLD.
 THIS IS "SC FEATURED."
 THIS IS THE POWER OF SPORTS.
 DEARLY BELOVED. WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY TO

 HOMETOWN OF MINNEAPOLIS AS THE
 MOST ELECTRIFYING SONGWRITER,
 LIVE PERFORMER, AND VIRTUOSO OF
 HIS ERA.
 BUT AS HIS FELLOW MUSICIANS
 LEARN AND FRIENDS COME NEW,
 PRINCE ROGERS NELSON HAD
 ANOTHER SET OF SPECTACULAR
 SKILLS.
 YEARS BEFORE HIS MUSIC SET THE
 WORLD ON FIRE, PRINCE MADE A
 NAME FOR HIMSELF ON THE COURT,
 OUTSIDE PARK AVENUE UNITED MET
 DISS CHURCH IN SOUTH
 MINNEAPOLIS.■■■F2■F2■■■■■■■ FIR
 SIXTH GRADE.
 PRINCE WAS VERY ATHLETIC.
 TO ME, HIS BIGGEST■F2F2F F■■■■■
  AND## HIS QUICKNESS.
 CHRIS: FROM THE#c#■## CHURCH LE
 JUNIOR HIGH, FROM SEVENTH NT
 THROUGH NINTH GRADE.P
 PRINCE AT POINT GUARD.
 YOU HAD TO BE READY FOR A
 NO-LOOK PASS FROM PRINCE BACK
 IN THE DAY.
 HE JUST HAD THAT ABILITY TO
 DECIPHER, CREATE, AND THEN
 IMPLEMENT A PLAY JUST ON THE
 SPOT.
 HE WOULD TAKE OFF RUNNING AND
 ZIGZAG AND DO ALL THOSE TYPES
 OF THINGS, AND HIS SPEED, THEY
 COULDN'T CATCH HIM.
 THE AFRO WAS ABOUT TWO FEET
 HIGH, SO HE WAS AT THAT TIME
 STILL THE SMALLEST GUY ON THE
 COURT.
 PRINCE WASN'T A GREAT SHOOTER.
 BUT HE WAS SO FAST AND SO QUICK
 WITH PASSING.
 CHRIS: CENTRAL HIGH BASKETBALL
 COACH AL NUNES WAS SCOUTING
 WHAT WAS THEN REGARDED AS A
 ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION GROUP OF
 MANY OF AYERS WOL■L■■■■ST■■■■■■
 TEAM AT CENTRAL, BUT PRINCE
 WOULD NOT BE AMONG THEM.
 WE WERE PLAYING, AND ALL OF
 A SUDDEN PRINCE WALKS OFF.
 HE LEAVES.
 HE'S GOT TO CATCH THE BUS.
 YOU KNOW, SMED MUSIC
 COMMITMENTS.
 YOU COULD SEE PRINCE START
 TO WEAN AWAY FROM THE GAME.
 CHRIS: EVEN WITH THE FAME AND
 THE GLOBAL SUCCESS, THE GAME
 STAYED WITH HIM.
 EVEN PRINCE'S PERSONAL
 PHOTOGRAPHER WOULD SEE HIM
 SHOOTING HOOPS AT PRINCE'S
 COMPOUND, PAISLEY PARK IN
 CHANHASSEN, MINNESOTA.
 IN THE LOADING DOCK, THERE
 WERE TWO BASKETBALL HOOPS AT
 THE OPPOSITE END THAT HAVE
 LOADING AREA.
 WE SHOT SOME PHOTOS OF HIM
 OUTSIDE, WHERE HE WAS JUST
 MESSING WITH THE BASKETBALL,
 JUST SPINNING ON HIS FINGER AND
 ALL THAT.
 IF YOU'VE EVER WATCHED A LIVE
 SHOW OF HIS, HE MOVED LIKE AN
 ATHLETE ALL THE TIME.
 HE'D JUMP ON TOP OF HIS PIANO
 IN FIVE-INCH HEELS.
 I THINK A LOT OF ATHLETES
 COULDN'T DO THAT.
 WE ALWAYS WORE HIGH HEELS
 WHEN WE PLAYED, SO WE'RE REALLY
 GOOD AT PLAYING TPWHAB OUR
 HEELS, WHICH IS CRAZY, BUT WE
 DID.
 CHRIS: YOU PLAYED BASKETBALL IN
 YOUR HEELS?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 CHRIS: DURING HER MID 1980'S
 COLLABORATIONS WITH PRINCE,
 PERCUSSIONIST AND SINGER SHEILA
 E. SAYS THE TWO WOULD BREAK
 FROM RECORDING TO HIT THE
 COURT.
 HE WAS A GREAT BASKETBALL
 PLAYER.
 HE REALLY WAS.
 HE COULD PLAY, NO JOKE.
 CHRIS: NOW, WHEN YOU'D BE
 PLAYING HORSE OR PIG, WHAT KIND
 OF A SHOOTER WAS HE?
 DID HE PRETTY GOOD, BUT DID
 I BETTER.
 I WAS BETTER THAN HIM IN
 THREE-POINT SHOTS.
 THIS IS ONE THING HE REALLY
 DID.
 IF I DID SOMETHING THAT WAS
 SILLY LIKE I WOULD GET THE
 BASKETBALL AND THEN I WOULD
 BOUNCE, I'D SAY YOU HAVE TO DO
 THIS, I BOUNCE, I DID SOMETHING
 LIKE THIS, AND THEN YOU TURN
 AND GO LIKE THIS.
 AND IF I MADE, IT HE'D LIKE,
 I'M NOT DOING IT.
 THEN TAKE A LETTER.
 HE WOULD GET MAD AT ME DOING
 SILLY THINGS LIKE THAT.
 IT'S JUST PART OF WHAT WE DID
 EVERY DAY OR, YOU KNOW, WHEN
 WE'RE RECORDING OR EVEN AT
 PAISLEY.
 YOU KNOW, WE'D JUST PLAY.
 CHRIS: NEWS OF PRINCE'S FINEST
 HOUR ON A BASKETBALL COURT
 EMERGED ON FEBRUARY 18, 2004,
 WHEN TV'S CHAPELLE SHOW AIRED
 ONE OF CHARLIE MURPHY'S TRUE
 HOLLYWOOD STORY.
 WE IN THE CLUB, AND PRINCE
 CAME IN.
 THAT'S WHEN "PURPLE RAIN" CAME
 OUT AND PRINCE WAS THE [BEEP],
 YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
 CHRIS: THE SKETCH TELLS THE
 STORY OF AN AFTER-HOURS PICKUP
 GAME BACK IN 1985 THAT PITTED
 COMEDIAN EDDIE MURPHY'S CREW
 VERSUS PRINCE AND HIS PALS.
 THE DAZZLING IMPRESSION OF
 PRINCE WAS PURE COMEDIC GOLD.
 HE'S WITH HIS WHOLE CREW,
 AND HE HAD HIS OTHER CAT NAMED
 MICKEY FREE.
 AND MICKEY FREE WAS LIKE THE
 NEW CAT, WHEN HE JOIN THE
 GROUP, I HEARD MAD CATS GO
 SHALOMAR GOT A NEW GIRL.
 IT WAS RIGHT ON.
 I LAUGH EVEN NOW ABOUT IT.
 CHRIS: MICKEY FREE, THEN WITH
 THE GROUP SHALOMAR, SUGGEST A
 DETAIL THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO
 THE CHAPELLE SKETCH, FUELING
 PRINCE'S FIRE TO GET ON THE
 COURT.
 EDDIE MURPHY BROUGHT BIG
 BOOM BOX WITH HIS NEW SONG
 "PARTY ALL THE TIME."
 PRINCE IS LIKE, LET'S PLAY
 BASKETBALL.
 THIS BORES ME.
 IS ANYONE UP FOR A GAME OF
 BASKETBALL?
 JUST LIKE THAT.
 AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT DID PRINCE
 JUST SAY?
 BECAUSE THEY'RE IN CLUB
 CLOTHES, FROM THE CLUB, RIGHT?
 YOU WERE WEARING A BLOUSE.
 WELL, I CALL A SHIRT WITH
 RUFFLES, CHRIS, YOU KNOW WHAT
 I'M SAYING?
 WHAT YOU KNOW WE GOING TO
 CALL THIS?
 THE SHIRT AGAINST THE BLOUSE.
 PRINCE BRINGS IT IN, AND I'M
 EVEN KIDDING WHEN I TELL YOU
 THIS, HE WAS LIKE STEPH CURRY,
 BABY.
 THEN HE GOES TO THE FAR RIGHT
 CORNER, FADEAWAY JUMP SHOT,
 NOTHING BUT NET.
 GOOD.
 IN YOUR FACE, CHARLIE MURPHY.
 PRINCE MASSACRED THOSE GUYS.
 IT WAS UNREAL.
 GAME.
 BLOUSES.
 ALL RIGHT, HE BEAT YOU IN
 BASKETBALL, AND THEN WHAT
 HAPPENED?
 AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER, HE
 TOOK US IN THE HOUSE AND SERVED
 US PANCAKES.
 IT WAS ONE OF MY SHOWS
 AFTER, AND HE'S GOING, DID YOU
 SEE THE SKIT?
 YEAH, YEAH, SIT DOWN.
 AND THEN WE'RE JUST SITTING,
 CHILLING, AND OUT OF NO I JUST
 SAID, DAVE, SOME SOME PANCAKES?
 CHRIS: TODAY, FOR THOSE WHO
 RECALL HIM ON THE COURT, WHERE
 HIS ZPHRARE CHARISMA STOOD OUT
 JUST LIKE THEY DID ON STAGE,
 LOOKING BACK STILL BRINGS A
 SMILE.
 ♪ YOU KNOW THE ONE
 DR. EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL
 RIGHT ♪
 EVEN TODAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S
 PRETTY SURREAL FOR ME TO LISTEN
 TO SOME OF HIS MUSIC AND THINK
 THAT'S THE SAME GUY WE USED TO
 HANG OUT WITH, YOU KNOW, BEHIND

 REPORT STORY WAS PUBLISHED
 ■÷ DETAILING A FRACTURED
 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RODGERS
 AND MIKE MCCARTHY.
 TENSIONS REPORTEDLY GO ALL THE
 ON RODGERS WITH THE FRTHY WAS A
 OF THE 8 2005 DRAFT.
 FORMER PACKERS WERE QUOTED,
 JERMICHAEL FINLEY SAID HE WAS A
 BAD LEADER, AND GREG JENNINGS
 CALLED HIM ULTRASENSITIVE.
 YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A
 MYSTERY.
 THIS WAS A SMEAR ATTACK BY, YOU
 KNOW, A WRITER LOOKING TO
 ADVANCE HIS CAREER, TALKING
 PLAYERS WHO ALL HAVE AN AGEND  ■
 WHETHER THEY'RE ADVANCING THEIR
 OWN CAREERS OR JUST TRYING TO
 STIR OLD STUFF UP.
 ■8■8■8■8■s■C OF THE ARTICLE SEE
 WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THE
 PACKERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT ME AS
 THE LEADER OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM
 MOVING FORWARD F. THEY KNEW
 THAT, WHY WOULD THEY OFFER ME A
 CONTRACT LAST YEAR?
 AND TWO, IF I REALLY DISL
 MICH, WHY WOULD I RE-SIGN?
 KNOWING IF IXp■■8 P, AND WE
 DO WHAT WE DO AROUND HERE, IT'S
 GOING TO BE ME AND MIKE MY
 ENTIRE CAREER.
 SO IF I REALLY DISLIKED HIM
 THAT MUCH, YOU THINK I'D
 RE-SIGN?
 AM I REALLY THAT -IS THE
 MONEY THAT IMPORTANT TO ME?
 I LOVE MCCARTHY.
 MIKE HAS BEEN A HUGE PART OF MY
 SUCCESS AND MY CAREER.
 AND I'VE HAD SOME AMAZING
 MOMENTS ON AND OFF THE FIELD
 WITH MIKE.
 JAY: TIM AND MATT HASSELBECK
 JACOBY: US NOW ON
 "SPORTSCENTER."
 TIM, LET'S START WITH YOU.
 AARON CALLED IT A SMEAR
 CAMPAIGN.
 WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?
 TIM: I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING
 ABOUT THIS FOR ME WITH AARON
 RODGERS  DOES AARON LOOK
 GOOD IN THE BLEACHER REPORT
 ARTICLE?
 NO, HE DOES NOT.
 BUT REALLY, IT WAS MIKE
 MCCARTHY THAT LOOKED THE WORST.
 WHAT AARON WAS DOING, YEAH, HE
 STUCK UP FOR HIMSELF A LITTLE
 BIT, BUT HE REALLY WAS TRYING
 TO CLEAR THE AIR FOR MIKE
 MCCARTHY.
 WHAT AARON REALLY DID WAS
 BASICALLY S■  MIKE
 MCCARTHY, HE'S BEEN A HUGE PART
 OF MY SUCCESS IN MY CAREER.
 HIVE GREAT MOMENTS WITH HIM ON
 AND OFF THE FIELD.
 THERE'S NO WAY THAT I -LIKE,
 I WANTED TO PLAY FOR HIM, WE
 WHAT HE WAS SAYING ON THE ND
 RADIO, HEaaa■a■a■a■a■■■■■■■■■■■
 SAY THANK YOU TO HIM FOR THE
 GOOD JOB HE D. I ACTUALLY
 THOUGHT THAT WAS FAIRLY
 SELFLESS OF AARON RODGERS TO
 STICK UP FOR A GUY THAT HE NO
 LONGER PLAYS FOR.
 MATT: I WOULD COMPLETELY AGREE
 WITH ALL OF THAT.
 YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST KIND OF
 THE STAR LEVEL THAT AARON
 RODGERS IS AT RIGHT NOW.
 I MEAN, SOMETIMES YOU'RE A
 STAR, YOU DO ONE LITTLE THING,
 IT'S NEWSWORTHY.
 HE DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING.
 LIKE THIS ARTICLE CAME OUT OF
 NOWHERE.
 IT REMINDS ME A LITTLE BIT OF
 THE FEW LAST YEAR THAT WAS BILL
 BELICHICK THAT CAN'T GET ALONG.
 THE YEAR BEFORE THAT AROUND
 THIS OFF-SEASON, IT WAS, YOU
 KNOW, RUSSELL WILSON, PETE
 CARROLL, AND THE LEGION OF
 BOOM.
 THIS YEAR, IT'S THE GREEN BAY
 PACKERS' TURN.
 AND HOW THEY MOVE FORWARD FROM
 THIS WILL BE TELLING, BUT I
 ALSO THINK COME AUGUST THIS
 WILL N SOMETHING THAT
 WE'R.= TALKING ABOUT.
 ALL EYES WILL BE ON AARON
 RODGERS, YES, BUT THEY'RE
 ALREADY ON AARON RODGERS AS WE
 SAW THIS WEEK.
 JAY: HE MENTIONED "MOSTLY
 IRRELEVANT, BITTER PLAYERS"
 ATTACKING HIM, SEEMINGLY A
 REFERENCE TO FIN SCOMPLEE
 JENNINGS.
 I'LL STICK WITH YOU, DO YOU FEE
 NECESSARY THAT
 CHARACTERIZATION?
 MATT: TO ME, WHAT I FEEL LIKE
 HE MEANT WAS IRRELEVANT TO THE
 RELATIONSHIP.
 YOU KNOW, SO I REMEMBER I
 PLAYED 10 YEARS IN SEATTLE.
 MIKE HOLMGREN WAS MY HEAD COACH
 MOST OF THAT TIM■1■í■■■WE ■n OF
 COULD PROBABLY GUESS WHAT OUR
 WAS ACb=■■=■/WAS LIKE, BUT IT
 PEOPLE THAT■= ACTUALLY KNEW WHA
 THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS LIKE.
 THIS SUMMER I HAD A CHANCE TO
 SIT DOWN WITH MIKE MCCARTHY,
 ONE OF MY OLD POSITION COACHES,
 SAT DOWN WITH HIM, WHAT IS YOUR
 RELATIONSHIP WITH AARON RODGERS
 REALLY LIKE?
 AND WHAT HE DESCRIBED WAS
 ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT AARON
 RODGERS DESCRIBED YESTERDAY.
 THESE GUYS DID GET ALONG.
 ■c) CONFLICT, SOME
 CREATIVE TENSION BETWEEN PLAY
 CALLER ANDD COACH AND
 QUARTERBACK?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 IS THAT NORMAL IN THE NFL?
 HECK, YEAH.
 THAT'S NORMAL.
 AND SO I THINK PROBABLY WHAT HE
 MEANT BY THAT WAS, PEOPLE THAT
 WOULD BE NOT IN THE KNOW ABOUT
 HOW IT REALLY IS BETWEEN TWO
 GUYS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING
 TOGETHER A LONG TIME.
 TIM: SAYING MOSTLY IRRELEVANT
 PLAYERS COMES ACROSS AS BAD.
 TARGETSE I ALSO THINK WHAT HE'S
 SAYING IS GREG JENNINGS AND
 JERMICHAEL FINLEY HAVEN'T BEEN
 IN THAT LOCKER ROOM FOR A LONG
 TIME.
 SOMEBODY THAT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
 MAY IN THE LOCKER ROOM FOR A
 PART OF A TEAM FOR A SHORT
 PERIOD OF TIME OVER A STRETCH
 OF OVER A DECADE, MAYBE SAW
 SOME CONFLICTS, BUT THAT
 DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S WHAT THE
 ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP IS ABOUT.
 AND SO THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
 YOU'RE SAYING.
 I THINK THAT'S WHY HE PROBABLY
 CAME OUT AS STRONGLY AS HE DID
 IN TERMS OF THOSE ATTACKS, YOU
 KNOW --
 JAY: AND TULSA FELT LIKE AN
 ATTACK ON THE WRITER.
 MATT: THE GUY WHO WROTE THE
 PIECE.
 YOU'RE GOING TO DO A BIG PIECE
 ON ME AND MIKE MCCARTHY AND THE
 PEOPLE YOU CHOSE TO TALK TO ARE
 THESE GUYS?
 WHY DENT YOU TALK SOME PEOPLE
 THAT ARE HERE NOW, OR PEOPLE
 THAT WOULD REALLY KNOW?
 THERE'S SOME ANGER IN HIS
 VOICE, NO DOUBT.
 AND I THINK WE SAW A SIDE OF
 AARON RODGERS THAT WE HAVEN'T
 SEEN MUCH OF.
 JAY: SEVERND FORMER
 PACKERS CAME TO THE DEFENSE OF
 RODGERS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS,
 JAMES JONES, CASEY.
 WE'LL SEE IF THIS IS THE END OF
 THIS OR IF THERE WILL BE MORE.
