         DOUG: STRAIGHT AHEAD ON
         "DAILY WAGER", THE DOG
         DAYS OF SUMMER ARE
         HERE.
         HOW A HOLIDAY HEAT WAVE
         COULD AFFECT BASEBALL
         TOTALS ACROSS THE NEXT
         FEW DAYS, AND COULD
         THAT SUNSHINE ALSO
         AFFECT HOT DOGS
         CAPTIONING MADE
         POSSIBLE BY ESPN, INC.
         DOUG: WE HOPE TO MAKE
         YOU A MORE INFORMED
         SPORTS BETTER.
         WE HAVE A PACKED SHOW
         COMING UP.
         WHO KNOWS, KAWHI COULD
         MAYBE MAKE A DECISION
         AT ANY SECOND E, AND
         THAT WOULD TURN THE NBA
         FUTURE ODDS UPSIDE
         DOWN.
         UNTIL THEN, LET'S GET
         ROLLING WITH THE REST
         OF THE SHOW, WHICH
         INCLUDES THE SUBWAY
         SERIES.
         FIRST PITCH, ABOUT AN
         HOUR AWAY.
         METS BEAT THE YANKS
         LAST NIGHT.
         HE HAD AN E.R.A. IN
         8 1/2 BEFORE A HIP
         INJURY.
         JASON VARGAS, HE IS
         2.36 E.R.A. IN THE LAST
         SEVEN STARTS.
         THE BOMBERS ARE FAVORED
         FOR THE GAME AND THE
         FIRST FIVE AND THE RUN
         TOTAL IS TEN.
         TEN.
         JOE JOINS ME FROM THE
         BAY AREA HERE.
         JOE, WHAT'S YOUR PLAY
         IN THIS ONE.
         JOE: IT MAY SOUND
         CRAZY, BUT I LIKE THE
         METS AT PLUS 130 IN
         THIS MATCHUP.
         THE YANKS SCORED JUST
         TWO RUNS IN THAT GAME
         LAST NIGHT AGAINST THE
         METS.
         THAT WAS JUST THE THIRD
         TIME IN THEIR LAST 39
         GAMES THAT THEY SCORED
         TWO OR FEWER RUNS.
         NOW, A LOT OF THAT IS
         DUE CREDIT TO ZACH
         WHEELER AND THE METS
         BULLPEN WHICH SHOWED UP
         LAST NIGHT, BUT I GOT
         TO WONDER AFTER THAT
         SERIES ACROSS THE POND
         AGAINST THE RED SOX,
         MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE
         JET LAG AND FATIGUE AT
         PLAY HERE FOR THE
         YANKEES.
         DUG I'VE HEARD THE
         WHOLE JET LAG THING,
         BUT THE BOSTON RED SOX
         DID PUT UP TEN RUNS OR
         MAYBE THE BLUE JAYS
         WERE JUST THAT BAD
         YESTERDAY.
         WE SHOULD SEE.
         YOU'RE ON THE METS.
         I KNOW I TALKED TO YOU
         YESTERDAY.
         MY APOLOGIES.
         YANKS-METS.
         ONE OF JUST -JUST ONE
         OF FIVE GAMES TONIGHT
         WITH A TOTAL OF AT
         LEAST TEN RUNS.
         ASTROS-ROCKIES LEADING
         THE WAY WITH A TOTAL OF

         DOUG: WHAT DO YOU HAVE
         IN TERMS OF OVER-UNDER?
         IT'S AT
         ASTROS-ROCKIES UNDER

         MY PROJECTION IS 13.1
         RUNS, AND THAT ACCOUNTS
         FOR 9-MILE-AN-HOUR
         WINDS, AND IT ACTS FOR
         THE FACT THAT THEY'RE
         PLAYING AT COORS FIELD.
         WE EVEN TALKED ABOUT
         YESTERDAY, IT'S CRAZY
         HAVING THESE ASTROS
         BATS.
         THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER
         THAN THE ROCKIES
         HITTING IN COORS FIELD,
         AND I STILL LOOKING AT
         THIS -THIS GUY HAS
         BEEN JUST STELLAR FOR
         TWO YEARS, AND IF YOU
         SAY, OH, COME ON FROM
         THE AMERICAN LEAGUE,
         PITCHING IN COORS FOR
         THE FIRST TIME, HE WAS
         WITH THE DIAMONDBACKS.
         HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO
         PITCHING IN COORS.
         EXPECTED BATTING
         AVERAGE AGAINST ALL OF
         THESE METRICS, AND ON
         THE OTHER SIDE LAMBERT,
         HE IS THE NUMBER ONE
         PROSPECT FOR THE
         ROCKIES.
         THAT IS THE CONCERN
         SOME IS THAT THE ASTROS
         JUST GO NUTS.
         I HAVE IT RIGHT AT 13
         ALMOST.
         I GOT TO GO UNDER.
         DOUG: ON THOSE LIST OF
         DOUBLE DIGIT TOTALS I
         WOULD GO OVER 11 1/2
         WITH THE PHILLIES AND
         BRAVES.
         BOTH PITCHERS HAVE
         REALLY STRUGGLED.
         BRYCE WILSON E.R.A.
         OVER EIGHT AND -I'M
         NOT GOING TO OVER THINK
         IT.
         I'LL TAKE THE OVER IN
         THAT ONE.
         PRESTON, SIT TIGHT FOR
         THAT, AND JOE, WHAT
         ABOUT YOU ON THAT LIST
         OF OVER-UNDER AND
         DOUBLE DIGITS?
         WHICH ONE JUMPED OUT TO
         YOU?
         PERHAPS THE SECOND HALF
         OF THE DOUBLE-HEADER.
         THEY'RE TIRED.
         THEY'VE BEEN OUT ON THE
         DIAMOND ALL DAY.
         THIS KID WILL BE ABLE
         TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
         THEM A LITTLE BIT, AND
         NOT ONLY THAT, CHICAGO
         IS ABOUT MIDDLE OF THE
         PACK IN OPS AGAINST
         LEFT-HANDED PITCHING.
         NOW, ON THE OTHER SIDE
         OF THE EQUATION, SAYS
         IT'S GOING TO BE ROSS
         DETWIELER WHO EARNED
         HIS MAJOR LEAGUE
         VICTORY IN THREE YEARS
         HIS FIRST TIME OUT A
         WEEK AGO.
         WENT UP AGAINST
         MINNESOTA.
         LOOKED REALLY SHARP.
         GAVE UP JUST TWO EARNED
         RUNS IN FIVE INNINGS
         PITCHED.
         HE WILL GO UP AGAINST
         THE TIGER LINE-UP
         TONIGHT.
         THAT'S 25th IN OPS
         AGAINST LEFT-HANDED
         PITCHING.
         I THINK THE PITCHERS
         HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
         SUCCESS.
         WE PLAY THE UNDER
         10 1/2 RUNS.
         WHITE SOX-TIGERS.
         DOUG: SOUNDS GOOD.
         SIT TIGHT.
         MUCH MORE FROM YOU AND
         PRESTON THROUGHOUT THE
         SHOW, AND WE TALKED
         COLLEGE FOOTBALL IN
         RECENT SHOWS.
         BIG TEN YESTERDAY.
         I ALSO COVERED THE
         S.E.C.
         A LITTLE ACC.
         HERE'S A LOOK AT YOUR
         HIGHEST -SIXTH
         HIGHEST WIN TOTALS
         COURTESY OF CEASAR'S
         FOR THE COMING SEASON.
         NO SURPRISE.
         CLEMSON WITH A SIZABLE
         GAP OVER THE REST OF
         THE CONFERENCE.
         11 1/2, MINUS 110
         EITHER SIDE.
         OBVIOUSLY, TREVOR
         LAWRENCE RETURNS FOR
         THE DEFEND DEFENDING
         NATIONAL CHAMPIONS.
         MIAMI AT 8 1/2.
         VIRGINIA EASTBOUNDING
         IT AT 8 AND A TRIO OF
         NC STATE, SYRACUSE, AND
         VIRGINIA ALL AT 7 1/2.
         JUICES ON THAT.
         LET'S WELCOME IN THE
         BEAR, CHRIS FELICA AND
         STANFORD STEVE.
         I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE
         CLOSE.
         THE BEAR: ABSOLUTELY.
         LET'S GO.
         DOUG: I'M GOING TO
         START WITH THE
         DEFENDING CHAMPS.
         CLEMSON 11 1/2.
         UNDER.
         DOUG: OVER.
         LOOK, THIS IS SCI, OUR
         FOOTBALL POWER INDEX
         PROJECTS THEM TO WIN
         ALL THEIR GAMES BY AT
         LEAST 20, EXCEPT FOR
         TWO.
         HOME TO A&M AND THAT'S
         15, AND THEN AT SOUTH
         CAROLINA 18.
         ALL OF THEM BY AT LEAST
         TWO TOUCHDOWNS.
         THEY'RE ONLY KIND OF
         QUESTIONABLE GAMES ARE
         AT HOME OR JUST NOT
         THAT -IT SHOULD BE
         WIRE TO WIRE.
         I THINK ALABAMA BEING
         IN THE RACE YOU'RE
         GOING TO HEAR A LOT
         ABOUT THAT.
         WE'LL KEEP THEM ON
         POINTED.
         WE TEND TO THINK, OH,
         CLEMSON ALWAYS WILL
         DROP ONE.
         THEY DIDN'T LAST YEAR.
         WE CAN'T ASSUME THAT,
         AND I THINK OVER

         THE WHOLE CLEMSON
         THING, THAT'S LONG
         GONE.
         THE ONLY THING THAT
         I -I WOULD PLAY THE
         OVER ON THAT AS WELL.
         THE ONLY THING I
         WOULD -THAT COULD
         TRIP THEM UP IS THE
         INJURY WHICH NOBODY
         WANTS TO SEE, BUT --
         DOUG: THEY'RE A&M AT
         HOME.
         THE SCHEDULE IS
         FAVORABLE FOR THEM TO
         RUN THE TABLE.
         I THINK THE
         CONFERENCE IS TERRIBLE.
         DOUG: BRUTAL.
         FIRE AWAY.
         ALL RIGHT.
         I'LL START.
         ON THE OTHER SIDE, I
         LOOK AT FLORIDA STATE,
         OKAY?
         NOW, THEY WERE AT A
         DISASTER LAST YEAR,
         OKAY?
         THEY WON FIVE GAMES.
         THEY STARTED NINE
         DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS
         ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
         OKAY?
         YOU KNOW, QUARTERBACKS
         WERE COMING IN AND OUT
         OF THERE.
         DEFENSIVELY THEY WERE
         AWFUL.
         THEY DIDN'T RANK IN THE
         TOP 1 00 IN ANY
         DEFENSIVE CATEGORIES.
         THE BEAR: THEY WERE ON
         SHORT FIELD.
         I THINK THEY AVERAGE
         THE 265 YARDS A GAME.
         21 POINT
         GUYS ARE HAVING TO
         PLAY.
         DUG WHO, THE KOECHSZ?
         A LOT OF REASONS.
         WITH THE COMBINATIONS
         OF ROSTER, OKAY, AND
         THEN THE SCHEDULE,
         OKAY, I THINK IT'S
         DOABLE.
         THE NUMBER 7.
         THEY HAVE THE TALENT TO
         DO IT.
         WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
         SCHEDULE, FIVE OF THE
         TEAMS, ALL RIGHT, WON
         NINE GAMES LAST YEAR.
         THAT'S A BIG DROP-OFF.
         THOSE TEAMS LOST A LOT
         OF GAMES.
         AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY
         FAVORABLE WHEN YOU LOOK
         AT EVERYTHING.
         I TAKE THREE GAMES THAT
         AREN'T WINNABLE AT
         CLEMSON, AT FLORIDA, AT
         VIRGINIA.
         THE BEAR: WE TALKED
         LAST WEEK ABOUT THOSE
         LINES WHEN AT THE CAME
         OUT.
         I LIKE FLORIDA STATE IN
         THAT GAME.
         YOU CANNOT GO TO
         VIRGINIA WITH THE
         CHANCE THAT THEY COULD
         BE 1-2 OFF THE BAT OFF
         THE YEAR THAT YOU HAD
         LAST YEAR.
         YOU'RE RIGHT.
         YOU THINK KENDALL, THE
         BIGGEST COORDINATOR
         HIRE.
         MAYBE EVEN HIM OR AL
         FINCH.
         DOUG: YEAH.
         WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO
         PLAY WITH?
         BLACKMAN, TWO YEARS
         AGO.
         DOUG: IS THE NUMBER ONE
         RECRUIT.
         HE HAS DEMONSTRATED
         THAT IN FLORIDA, AND HE
         HAS ANOTHER YEAR TO
         IMPLEMENT ALL THOSE
         GUYS.
         NOT WHO IS GOING TO
         PLAY SKREM E CLEMSON
         AND -WHO IS THE
         SECOND BEST TEAM?
         WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT,
         YOU KNOW, THREE MONTHS
         AGO YOU ASKED A
         QUESTION WHEN WE DID
         LIKE THE KENTUCKY
         DERBY.
         SYRACUSE, THEY LOOKED
         GREAT.
         DOUG: FPI SAYS 8.1 WIN.
         ALL THOSE GUYS ARE
         DEFENSE.
         GONE.
         I'M ON THE UNDER THIS
         YEA
         I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
         CAN LINE UP THAT
         OFFENSIVE LINE AND DEAL
         35 TIMES LIKE THEY
         WANT.
         THEY HAVE A COORDINATOR
         CHANGE ON BOTH SIDES OF
         THE BALL.
         WE'LL SEE HOW THAT
         GOES.
         THEY'VE BEEN A SIX OR
         SEVEN WIN TEAM EVERY
         YEAR UNDER HIM.
         YOU LOOK AT VIRGINIA
         TECH TO START THE
         OPENING UP.
         THEY SHOULD WIN THE
         NEXT THREE.
         I'M HIGH ON WAKE
         FOREST.
         I THINK THEY'RE GOING
         TO BE REALLY GOOD.
         LOOK AT THE WAY THEY
         FINISH.
         THOSE FINAL FIVE GAMES,
         IF THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN
         TO SEVEN BY THE TIME
         THEY GO TO CLEMSON,
         THEY'RE NOT GOING TO.
         STEVE: THAT'S WHY I
         LIKE FLORIDA STATE OVER
         AND --
         THEY JUST RELOAD.
         SOMETHING LIKE BC --
         THEY DEVELOP PRAYERS
         AND FIND GUYS THAT THEY
         GET INTO THEIR SYSTEM,
         AND I THINK IT'S A
         YOUNG OFFENSIVE LINE.
         I'M THINKING THEY'RE.
         DOUG: 5.1.
         STEVE: DO YOU HAVE A
         CALCULATOR OVER THERE?
         DOUG: SPREADSHEET.
         MY COMPUTER MODEL.
         THE BEAR: PROBABLY DID
         TAKE IT.
         STEVE: VIRGINIA AND I
         HAVE A THING.
         THEY LOOK GOOD.
         THE BEAR: THEY DO?
         DUG WE HAVE PRESENT OF
         TIME.
         WE HAVE GAME ONE --
         WEEK ONE LINES WE CAN
         DISSECT AS WELL
         THROUGHOUT THE REST OF
         THE SUMMER.
         BEAR AND STANFORD STEVE
         HERE IN THE HOUSE.
         WE ALL LIKE A LITTLE
         TENNIS ACTION.
         ESPECIALLY IN THE

         THIRD ROUND TO HERTZOG.
         WE WENT OUT YESTERDAY
         AS A WINNER.
         WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?
         LOTS OF UPSETS SO FAR.
         BOTH PLAYERS HAVE SPLIT
         SIX CAREER MEETINGS.
         ON THE WOMEN'S SIDE 11
         SEED SERENA WILLIAMS IS
         GOING TO FACE A
         QUALIFIER.
         SHE'S A PERFECT 18-0 IN
         SECOND ROUND MATCHES IN
         THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB,
         AND IS A MINUS 750
         FAVORITE.
         LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
         SOME OF THE OTHER
         NOTABLE MATCHUPS AS WE
         CATCH OUR EYE.
         ANG LEAK MINUS 950.
         HEY, YOU DON'T LIKE THE
         BIG JUICE.
         YOU DON'T WANT TO LAY
         THE LUMBER.
         YOU CAN ALWAYS DO A
         MONEY LINE PARLAY AND
         SAM QUERY WITH THE
         UPSET IS MINUS 460 IN
         HIS SECOND MATCH.
         AS FOR A COUPLE OF
         POTENTIAL UPSETS AND
         OTHER PICKS, LET'S TURN
         IT OVER TO OUR PATRICK
         McENROE.
         EXPECTING MORE
         BEAUTIFUL WEATHER, AND
         THE MATCH WE'VE ALL
         BEEN WAITING FOR ON THE
         MEN'S SIDE IN ROUND TWO
         THAT WILL BE BETWEEN
         THE TWO-TIME CHAMP
         RAFAEL NADAL AND THE
         WHACKY ONE FROM
         AUSTRALIA NICK WHO CAN
         ALSO PLAY SERIOUS
         TENNIS, PARTICULARLY ON
         GRASS.
         REMEMBER, A COUPLE OF
         YEARS AGO HE UPSET
         NADAL RIGHT HERE AT
         WIMBLEDON ON CENTER
         COURT.
         I'M NOT EXPECTING THAT
         TO HAPPEN TOMORROW.
         I THINK NADAL IS READY
         FOR THIS ACCIDENT,
         HAVING WON THE FRENCH
         OPEN.
         HE HAS SOME CONFIDENCE.
         THIS IS HIS LEAST
         FAVORITE SURFACE.
         THE FAVORITE.
         HE HAS NOT LOOKED LIKE
         THE PLAYER HE WAS A
         COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
         I EXPECT NADAL TO MAYBE
         DROP A SET, BUT
         PROBABLY WIN THIS ONE
         IN FOUR SETS.
         I EXPECT HER TO WIN
         COMFORTABLY IN STRAIGHT
         SETS.
         BACK TO YOU, DOUG.
         DOUG: PATRICK, THANKS
         SO MUCH.
         LOOK, IT'S INDEPENDENCE
         DAY, AND FIRE AWAY IN
         THE MORNING, THROUGHOUT
         THE AFTERNOON.
         YOU GOT SOME BASEBALL
         ON JULY 4th.
         HE IS STREAMING LIVE ON
         THE ESPN APP.
         WE'VE BEEN TALKING A
         LOT OF PRO FOOTBALL
         PROPS.
         TOURS OF EACH DIVISION.
         WE'RE DOING THE SOUTH
         DIVISIONS THIS WEEK.
         AC SOUTH WITH THE COLT.
         PLAYER PROP COURTESY OF
         CEASAR'S.
         ANDREW LUCK TOUCHDOWN
         TOTAL 32 1/2.
         HE HAS GONE OVER JUST
         TWICE IN HIS FIVE FULL
         SEASONS.
         MARLIN NEEDS A 1,000
         YARD RUSHING SEASON TO
         GO OVER HIS STOELGTS.
         THE COLTS HAVE HAD ONE
         1 ,000 YARD RUSHER IN
         THE LAST DECADE.
         THAT WAS FRANK GORE IN

         LET'S BRING IN NOW OUR
         MALE MODELERS, PRESTON
         JOHNSON AND MIKE CLAY
         WHO HAVE SPREADSHEETS
         AND LAPTOPS IN HAND AS
         WE BREAK THIS DOWN.
         ANDREW LUCK, 32TD
         PASSES.
         WHAT ARE YOUR NUMBERS
         SAYING, MIKE?
         MIKE: GOING OVER ON
         THIS ONE.
         THIS GUY IS 39 PASSING
         TOUCHDOWNS LAST SEASON.
         THAT WAS SECOND MOST IN
         THE NFL BEHIND ONLY --
         YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF
         HIM.
         THE LAST TIME WE SAW
         ANDREW LUCK FOR A FULL
         16 GAME SEASON, HE HAD
         40 PASSING TOUCHDOWNS,
         AND REALLY THE KEY HERE
         IS OPPORTUNITY.
         YOU HAVE AN OTD WHICH
         WAS SET ESSENTIALLY
         EXPECTED -EXPECTED
         PASSING TOUCHDOWNS
         BASED ON YOUR
         OPPORTUNITY WHERE YOU
         ARE ON THE FIELD AND
         YOUR VOLUME OF THROWS.
         LUCK LAST YEAR, TOPS IN
         THE NFL.

         THE KEY THROWN INTO THE
         END ZONE.
         THE COLTS HAD 50 LAST
         SEASON.
         THAT WAS MOST IN THE
         LEAGUE.
         THIS OFFENSE STEPPED UP
         FOR HIM TO THROW A TON
         OF TOUCHDOWNS.
         SOUNDS GOOD.
         PRESTON, WHAT ARE YOUR
         PROJECTIONS?
         WE DO THIS EVERY
         DAY, AND I HAD ANDREW
         LUCK AT 28 TOUCHDOWNS,
         AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE
         IT.
         THERE'S NO WAY I'M
         BETTING UNDER ON THIS.
         IF YOU LOOK AT IT, AND
         I AGREE WITH MIKE,
         LIKE, THERE'S SO MUCH
         VALUE HERE WITH ANDREW
         LUCK, ASSUMING HE PLAYS
         A FULL SEASON.
         I'M NOT SURE HOW HE
         DOESN'T GO OVER 32 1/2.
         I ACTUALLY AM STAYING
         OFF OF THIS DESPITE MY
         PROJECTIONS POINTING TO
         AN EDGE ON THE UNDER,
         BUT BECAUSE I AM LOWER
         ON ANDREW LUCK'S
         PROJECTIONS, THERE ARE
         SOME CORRELATED BETS,
         WHICH WE'LL GET TO HERE
         IN A BIT, WHICH I THINK
         ARE SAFER AND BETTER AS
         FAR AS SOME OF THE
         RECEIVERS GO?
         BEING LOOK BACK AT
         THE LAST THREE SEASONS
         AND HOW THEY'VE PLAYED
         TOGETHER IN FULL.
         THEY'VE BLOWN THIS
         NUMBER AWAY ALL THREE
         SEASONS.
         THERE'S A FEW THINGS IN
         PLAY HERE.
         ONE OF THE THEM IS
         DURABILITY.
         HE HAS MISSED FOUR
         GAMES IN SEVEN SEASONS
         IN THE LEAGUE.
         HE FINISHED TOP 17 IN
         RECEIVING YARDS.
         EACH OF THE PAST SIX
         SEASONS.
         GUYS, HE HAS BEEN IN
         THE 80th PERCENT I'LL
         OR BETTER IN YARDS PER
         RECEPTION EACH OF THE
         PAST FIVE SEASONS.
         IT'S ANDREW LUCK GOING
         THROUGH GUYS.
         THIS IS A HIGH VOLUME
         PASS-HEAVY OFFENSE, AND
         I THINK HE GETS TO THAT
         NUMBER EASILY.
         DOUG: PRESTON, AND YOU?
         PRESTON: THIS ONE WHERE
         WE DISAGREE.
         I'M CORRELATED HERE
         WITH NOT LOVING ANDREW
         LUCK'S NUMBERS, BUT
         HILTON I ATHE 1,140
         YARDS.
         FOR ME THERE IS A
         SLIGHT EDGE TO THE
         UNDER, AND YOU LOOK AT
         THE SCOPE OF WHO LUCK
         WILL BE THROWING TO.
         THEY WENT OUT OF THEIR
         WAY TO BRING IN DEVIN
         AND DRAFTED PARIS
         CAMPBELL OUT OF OHIO
         STATE WHO I THINK WILL
         BE STELLAR.
         THEN HE PLAYED A BUNCH
         LAST YEAR AT TIGHT END.
         DOYLE POLICED A LOT OF
         LAST SEASON.
         I HAVE THOSE TWO
         TIGHTENDS COMBINED.
         I THINK TY HILTON IS
         TARGET SHARE GOING
         DOWN.
         I HAVE HIM UNDER 1,200
         YARDS.
         IT'S A BET UNDER FOR
         ME.
         DOUG: I LIKE WHEN YOU
         DISAGREE.
         MIKE, LET'S GO TO YOU.
         MARLIN MACK, WILL HE BE
         A 1,000 YARD RUSHER.
         NOT COMBINED.
         JUST RUSHING YARDS.
         YES, HE WILL.
         HE SORT OF WAS LAST
         YEAR.
         YOU LOOK AT HIS 14
         GAMES, INCLUDING THE
         PLAYOFFS.
         HE HAD A LITTLE OVER
         1,100 YARDS, AND THAT
         WAS WITH PLAYING A
         SITUATIONAL ROLE FOR A
         LOT OF THE EARLY PART
         OF THE SEASON.
         THE GUY HAS BEEN
         TERRIFIC SINCE HE HAS
         ENTERED THE LEAGUE, AND
         HE HAD 4.8 YARDS PER
         CARRY LAST SEASON.
         YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
         TOO WRAPPED UP IN YARDS
         PER CARRY, BUT HE HAS
         BEEN ABOVE AVERAGE
         AFTER CONTACT PER
         ATTEMPTS IN BOTH OF
         THINKS NFL SEASONS.
         HE HAD A LOT OF HELP
         LAST SEASON FROM
         QUINTON NELSON AS WELL.
         HERE'S THE BIG ONE.
         IN HIS LAST FIVE GAMES
         LAST SEASON, HE HANDLED
         AT LEAST 75% OF THE
         COLTS DESIGNED RUNDZ
         AND EACH OF THOSE
         GAMES.
         THE GUY IS WORKING HIS
         WAY INTO BECOMING A
         TWO-MAN WORK HORSE FOR
         THIS COLTS OFFENSE.
         I LIKE THE OVER A LOT
         HERE.
         DOUG: MIKE, YOU ARE
         BULLISH ON THE COLTS'
         OFFENSE.
         YOU MENTIONED AIRCRAFT
         HEBRON A MOMENT AGO.
         SIX AND A HALF
         TOUCHDOWNS FOR HIS
         PROP.
         WHERE ARE YOU HEADED
         WITH THIS?
         THIS IS ANOTHER GUT
         CHECK.
         I'M GOING WITH IT.
         I HAVE PROJECTED 5.2
         TOUCHDOWNS.
         I MENTIONED JACK DOYLE
         IS BACK.
         HE SHOULD BE HEALTHIER,
         AND I PROJECT HIM TO
         HAVE A GOOD PORTION OF
         THE SECOND TIGHT END OF
         HIS POTENTIAL TARGET
         SHARE.
         DEVIN, THIS GUY IS

         AS FAR AS RED ZONE
         OPPORTUNITIES GO AND
         GOAL LINE
         OPPORTUNITIES, HEBRON
         OUTSIDE OF LAST YEAR
         WHERE HE SCORED 13
         TOUCHDOWNS, THAT'S WHY
         IT'S A GUT CHECK YOU
         SHOULD SIX AND A HALF.
         HE NEVER GOT MORE THAN
         FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN A
         SEASON.
         THAT WAS IN DETROIT.
         MATTHEW STAFFORD IS NOT
         INEPT.
         THERE'S SO MUCH GOING
         AROUND HERE FOR LUCK.
         I HAVE TO GO UNDER.
         DOUG: AGAIN, A LITTLE
         TECHNICALITY AT TOTAL
         TOUCHDOWNS.
         A RECOVERED FUMBLE IN
         THE GOAL LINE.
         SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
         THAT CHANGES
         EVERYTHING.
         DOUG: YOU WANT TO GO
         BACK TO YOUR
         SPREADSHEET AND
         RE-EVALUATE IT?
         MORE TO COME FROM
         PRESTON STRAIGHT AHEAD.
         AND FROM PLAYER PROP TO
         TEAM PROPS.
         INDY'S WIN TOTAL IS
         TEN, WHICH IS WHEN THEY
         WON LAST YEAR.
         THE OVER, PLUS 110, AND
         THE YES-NO TO MAKE THE
         PLAYOFFS.
         YES IS MINUS $1.75,
         WHICH THEY SURE, IN
         FACT, DID IN FRANK
         WRIGHT'S FIRST SEASON
         WITH THE COLTS.
         LET'S GO OUT TO NEW
         YORK AND BRING IN OUR
         ANITA MARKS.
         ANITA, OVER-UNDER TEN.
         NOW, I AM PASSING
         BECAUSE I THINK IT'S
         GOING TO BE RIGHT
         THERE.
         THEY HAVE TO FACE THE
         NFC SOUTH.
         REALLY TOUGH SCHEDULE.
         SUPPOSED TO BE A
         COMPETITIVE DIVISION.
         IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT
         AROUND THERE.
         I'M GOING TO PASS.
         WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         ANITA: I'M ON THE OVER
         A LITTLE BIT.
         I'M NOT BANKING THE
         MORTGAGE ON THE OVER,
         BUT I AM PUTTING A
         LITTLE MONEY ON THE
         OVER FOR A NUMBER OF
         REASONS.
         LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
         SCHEDULE.
         LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
         THE SCHEDULE, ACTUALLY.
         I HAVE THEM WINNING
         THEIR DIVISION.
         THE AFC SOUTH.
         I THINK THEY SPLIT WITH
         HOUSTON.
         I THINK THEY GO 2-0
         AGAINST TENNESSEE.
         THEY COULD POSSIBLY GO
         2-0 AGAINST THE
         JAGUARS.
         LOOKING AT 5-1, 4-3 IN
         THEIR DIVISION.
         EASY GAMES WITH ALL DUE
         RESPECT TO OAKLAND,
         DENVER, AND MIAMI.
         HERE'S WHERE IT GETS
         TOUGH.
         LOOK AT THE ROAD GAMES
         IN THE QUARTERBACKS
         THEY'RE GOING TO BE
         FACING.
         YOU READY?
         THE CHARGERS, THE
         CHIEFS, THE STEELERS,
         THE TEXANS, THE SAINTS.
         IT'S A TOUGH ROAD GAME.
         I HAVE THEM GOING 3-2
         ON THE ROAD, SO IT'S
         GOING TO BE CLOSE, BUT
         I THINK THIS TEAM IS
         JUST SO GOOD, DOUG,
         THAT I HAVE THEM -I
         HAVE THEM AT 10-1 --
         10, 11 WINS.
         DOUG: I WAS DEFINITELY
         LEANING THAT WAY, BUT
         I'M GOING TO PASS.
         AS FOR THE YES-NO, I
         LIKE THE YES TO MAKE
         THE PLAYOFFS AT MINUS

         A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN
         THE DIVISION BECAUSE
         YOU COULD GET TO THE
         PLAYOFFS AND NOT GET
         OVER TEN WINS.
         NINE OR TEN WINS IN
         THIS DIVISION COULD WIN
         IT.
         I'M GOING TO SAY I LIKE
         THE YES TO MAKE THE
         PLAYOFFS AT MINUS 1.75.
         OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE THE
         BONUS OF THE WILD CARD,
         BUT THAT'S WHY I'M
         DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN
         THAT AND OVER TEN WINS.
         WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         ANITA: AGAIN, I HAVE
         THEM WINNING THIS
         DIVISION.
         I LOVE THIS TEAM.
         OUT OF ALL THE 22
         STARTERS ON OFFENSE AND
         DEFENSE, THEY ONLY HAVE
         ONE GUY NOT COMING
         BACK.
         THAT'S AMAZING.
         THAT JUST DOESN'T
         HAPPEN IN THIS DAY AND
         AGE IN FREE AGENCY.
         ON TOP OF THAT, THEY
         ARE ONE OF THE MOST
         BALANCED TEAMS IN THE
         NFL.
         FIRST AND THIRD DOWN
         CONVERSIONS IN 2018.
         ANDREW LUCK, WHEN HE IS
         HEALTHY, HE IS A TOP
         FIVE QUARTERBACK.
         HE HAS THE BEST
         OFFENSIVE LINE COMING
         IN.
         WIDE RECEIVERS, YOU GOT
         TO LOVE TY HILTON AND
         ADD DEVIN FUNCHES.
         THEY DRAFT PAIR
         CAMPBELL.
         I LOVE THE ONE-TWO
         PUNCH WITH THEIR TIGHT
         END.
         EBRON TOOK A BIG STEP
         WITH THEM THIS YEAR AS
         OPPOSED WHAT WITH HE
         SAW IN DETROIT.
         JACK DOYLE, HE IS GOING
         TO BE HEALTHY.
         THEN THEY ADD JUSTIN
         HOUSTON ON THE
         DEFENSIVE SIDE OF THE
         BALL, SO I JUST LOVE
         THIS TEAM.
         I THINK THEY'RE GOING
         TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS.
         I THINK THEY WIN THE
         DIVISION, DOUG.
         DOUG: SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE
         ALL VERY POSITIVE ON
         THE COLTS.
         THAT'S ANITA MARKS.
         SHE'LL JOIN US LATER IN
         THE SHOW TO DISCUSS THE
         WEEKEND PGA TOURNAMENT.
         THAT'S COMING UP LATER.
         ANITA: THERE YOU GO.
         DOUG: AND WE'RE
         APPROACHING THE BOTTOM
         OF THE HOUR, AND IN
         THESE PARTS THAT MEANS
         ONE THING.
         BEST BETS.
         JUST AROUND THE CORNER.
         STAY TUNED.

         DOUG: BACK WITITH YOU         RECAPPING BEBEST BETS.
         STRONG NIGHT FOR US ON
         THE DIAMOND.
         ASTROS GOT FOUR RUNS IN
         THE SEVENTH.
         TURNED A THREE-RUN
         DEFICIT INTO A ONE-RUN
         VICTORY.
         PLUS 117 FOR PRESTON
         THERE ON THE STROS.
         A'S HIT FOR JOE.
         MY RAYS-DODGERS PARLAY
         GOT THIS THANKS TO FIVE
         CONSECUTIVE WALKS.
         BETTER LUCKY THAN GOOD.
         ALL RIGHT.
         SO 5-2 FROM THE WEEK.
         LET'S KEEP THE MOMENTUM
         GOING.
         HERE AT THE DESK
         STANFORD STEVE HERE
         STANDING BY FOR YOUR
         BEST BET.
         WE'LL GET THAT IN A
         MOMENT.
         LET'S GO BACK OUT TO
         LAS VEGAS.
         PRESTON, WHAT DO YOU
         HAVE FOR YOUR BEST BET?
         YOU'RE ON THE TEE BOX
         FIRST.
         PRESTON: THE GRIZZLIES
         MINUS 2 1/2.
         THE ONLY GUY GETTING
         RUNS THAT HAS ANY PRO
         EXPERIENCE IS NAZ WHO
         PLAYED A TOTAL OF 85
         MINUTES FOR THE JAZZ
         THE LAST TWO YEARS.
         ON THE OTHER SIDE THIS
         MEMPHIS TEAM, THIS IS A
         ROSTER FILLED WITH A
         BUNCH OF GUYS WHO
         PLAYED FAIRLY REGULAR
         MINUTES THE LAST TWO
         SEASONS WHEN MEMPHIS
         WAS TANKING.
         ROB, WASHBURN.
         THESE GUYS TOTALED 63
         POINTS I THINK ON
         MONDAY WHEN THEY
         PLAYED.
         THEY ALL RESTED
         YESTERDAY.
         NOW, CARTER WORTH
         NOTING ACTUALLY JUST
         GOT TRADED TO THE SUNS.
         PROBABLY WON'T PLAY
         BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
         AFFORD HIM TO GET
         INJURED.
         THESE OTHER THREE GUYS
         COMBINED FOR 34 POINTS.
         THEY HAVE SO MUCH
         EXPERIENCE COMPARED TO
         THE CAVS WHO ARE
         PLAYING A BUNCH OF
         ROOKIES.
         IT DOESN'T IMPACT THE
         PROJECTION TOO MUCH TO
         BE MORE LIKE MINUS 5.
         WE'RE GETTING 2, 2 1/2
         ON THE MARKET.
         I'M GOING WITH THE
         GRIZZLIES.
         DOUG: DO YOU BELIEVE IN
         REST DAYS IN VEGAS?
         COME ON.
         OR WAS THAT IN SALT
         LAKE.
         PRESTON: THIS ONE IS IN
         SALT LAKE.
         DOUG: FEWER
         DISTRACTIONS, I WOULD
         THINK.
         YOU WOULD THINK.
         YOU NEVER KNOW.
         DOUG: PRESTON IS
         PLAYING HOME COURT
         ADVANTAGE.
         HE IS OUT THERE IN LAS
         VEGAS.
         JOE, WHAT DO YOU GOT
         FOR YOUR BEST BET?
         JOE: THE SAN FRANCISCO
         GIANTS AT PLUS 120 OVER
         THE SAN DIEGO PADRES AS
         THEY LOOK FOR THE SWEEP
         TONIGHT.
         THE GIANTS' BATS HAVE
         COME ALIVE AS OF LATE.
         THREE STRAIGHT WINS,
         ALL OF WHICH HAVE
         FEATURED TEN OR MORE
         RUNS.
         NOW, TONIGHT THE PADRES
         WHO RANKED 19th AT OPS
         ARE GOING TO FACE GIANT
         RIGHT-HANDER SEAN
         ANDERSON.
         ANDERSON HAS BEEN THE
         MOST CONSISTENT PITCHER
         FOR THE GIANTS THIS
         SEASON.
         A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY
         THINK THAT'S MADISON
         BUMGARNER.
         GO BACK TO JUNE 12th.
         HE FACED THE PADRE
         LINE-UP.
         FOUR HITS, TWO EARNED
         RUNS IN SIX INNINGS
         PITCHED.
         HE IS GOING TO TAKE THE
         MOUND FOR THE GIANTS,
         WHICH IS THE BIG EDGE
         HERE.
         HE IS EXTREMELY
         UNDERVALUED.
         FOR THE PADRES, IT'S
         GOING TO BE THE
         YOUNGSTER CALTRON.
         THE RIGHTY AGAINST SAN
         FRANCISCO.
         IS HE COMING OUT OF THE
         BULLPEN TO MAKE HIS
         FIRST START IN A FEW
         WEEKS.
         SIX STARTS THIS SEASON.
         HE HAS AN E.R.A. NORTH
         OF FIVE.
         18 EARNED RUNS AND JUST
         31 INNINGS PITCHED.
         I LIKE THE GIANTS TO
         GET THE SWEEP TONIGHT,
         AND THEN THEY'RE OFF
         TOMORROW.
         FIRST TIME OFF ON JULY
         4th SINCE 1941.
         GIANTS PLUS 120.
         YOU CAN BOOK IT.
         DOUG: GIANTS BATS HAVE
         BEEN HOT IN SAN DIEGO.
         WE HAVE PRESTON IN
         VEGAS.
         PICKING A SUMMER LEAGUE
         GAME.
         GRIZZLIES-GIANTS,

         MARLINS.
         JOE IN THE BAY AREA
         TAKING THE GIANTS.
         YOU GOING TO THE
         TRI-STATE AREA FOR
         YOURS?
         STEVE: DARN RIGHT.
         THE ALL MIGHTY YANKEES.
         FIRST TIME SINCE 2013.
         THAT'S NOT GOING TO
         HAPPEN.
         DOUG: NO, SIR.
         STEVE: BACK ON THE
         MOUND FORT YANKEES.
         TAKE THE YANKEES.
         DOUG: HE IS THROWING
         WELL LATELY.
         YOU'RE STICKING TO THE
         HOME TEAM, SO TO SPEAK.
         I'M GOING WITH MY TEAM,
         AND WHERE I'M GOING TO
         BE THIS HOLIDAY
         WEEKEND.
         I'M GOING WITH THE
         DODGERS.
         LOOK, I GOT LUCKY LAST
         NIGHT.
         FIRST ONE --
         STEVE: LUCKY?
         DOUG: BEYOND LUCKY.
         STEVE: I DON'T WANT TO
         HEAR ABOUT THAT
         ANYMORE.
         NEVER AGAIN.
         DOUG: IN AN EIGHT-START
         STRETCH AN E.R.A. OF

         EIGHT STARTS.
         THEN GOT TOUCHED UP THE
         LAST ONE.
         THAT WAS AT COORS
         FIELD.
         COORS FIELD.
         DODGERS ARE HOT.
         AMAZING HOME RECORD.
         FIVE STRAIGHT WALKS
         WE'RE GOING TO NEED
         TO COVER
         IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE
         BEFORE
         WE'RE GOING TO HOPE
         NOT TO GET TO THE
         BOTTOM OF THE NINTH.
         WE NEED BREATHING ROOM,
         BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
         BUELLER IS GOING TO
         GIVE UP MUCH.
         I THINK THIS ONE GETS
         AWAY FROM THE D-BACKS.
         WHO KNOWS?
         LOCKER ROOM DEMORALIZED
         AFTER THAT?
         BULLPEN CERTAINLY IS
         SHAKY.
         I'LL LAY THE ONE AND A
         HALF.
         I COULDN'T FIND ANY
         OBSCENE MONEY LINES AND
         PARLAY WITH THE DODGERS
         STRAIGHT UP.
         I WILL JUST LAY THE RUN
         AND A HALF AND TRY TO
         STAY HOT THIS WEEK.
         STEVE LAYING THE $1.38
         AS WELL.
         ALL OF US PLAYING TO
         OUR HOME TEAMS.
         I LOVE IT.
         JOE PLUS MONEY WITH THE
         GIANTS AND THE
         GRIZZLIES FOR PRESTON
         OUT THERE.
         I LOVE IT, SCOUTING FOR
         PRESTON.
         STEVE: I KNOW.
         DOUG: GOLD CUP
         SEMIFINALS TONIGHT.
         MEN'S SOCCER FOR THE
         AMERICANS AS THEY FACE
         JAMAICA.
         REMEMBER, THEY MET LAST
         GOLD CUP FINAL IN 2017.
         2-1 VICTORY FOR THE
         AMERICANS.
         THREE-WAY BETTING.
         U.S. IS 190 MINUS $1.90
         TO WIN IN REGULATION.
         THE DRAW PLUS $2.75 AND
         JAMAICA A HUGE UNDERDOG
         WITH THE OVER-UNDER AT
         2.50, AND THE UNDER IS
         MINUS $1 .90.
         FOR MORE LET'S GO OUT
         TO NASHVILLE AHEAD OF
         TONIGHT'S GAME AND
         BRING IN ESPN-FC
         REPORTER JEFF CARLISLE.
         JEFF, APPRECIATE YOU
         TAKING THE TIME.
         U.S. FAVORITE AS YOU
         WELL KNOW, BUT LET'S GO
         BACK ABOUT A MONTH AGO
         WHERE THEY LOST A
         FRIENDLY TO JAMAICA

         HOW DOES THE TEAM
         TONIGHT COMPARE TO THE
         ONE THAT LOST THAT
         GAME?
         WELL, IT'S GOING TO
         BE A VERY DIFFERENT
         TEAM TO TAKE THE FIELD
         FOR THE UNITED STATES
         TONIGHT.
         I COUNT AT LEAST SEVEN
         DIFFERENT PLAYERS THAT
         WILL BE IN THE STARTING
         LINE-UP.
         POSSIBLY EIGHT.
         THOSE ARE KEY PLAYERS
         AS WELL.
         KEY ATTACKING PLAYERS
         WHEN YOU ARE TALKING
         ABOUT CHRISTIAN, WESLEY
         McKINNEY.
         THE FORWARD WILL BE
         JOSIE ALTADORE.
         NONE OF THE PLAYERS
         PLAYED IN THAT GAME.
         THEN YOU HAVE THE GUY
         KIND OF PROVIDING THE
         SHIELD IN FRONT OF THE
         DEFENSE.
         MICHAEL BRADLEY.
         HE IS GOING TO BE A KEY
         PLAYER FOR THE U.S.
         TONIGHT.
         HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO
         PLAY VERY WELL, BE VERY
         MOBILE, AND SO
         OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO
         BE A VERY DIFFERENT
         TEAM FOR THE U.S. TO
         TAKE THE FIELD.
         CONTRAST THAT WITH JAM
         ACHE WHY.
         THEY HAVE SEVEN PLAYERS
         THAT TOOK THE FIELD IN
         THE QUARTERFINAL
         AGAINST PANAMA THAT
         WERE ALSO ON THE FIELD
         THAT NIGHT IN
         WASHINGTON D.C. WHEN
         THEY PLAYED THAT
         FRIENDLY AGAINST THE
         U.S.
         JAMAICA IS GOING TO
         HAVE A FEW NEW FACES.
         THE U.S. WILL HAVE A
         LOT OF NEW FACES.
         DOUG: THE OVER-UNDER IS
         TWO AND A HALF.
         HOW MUCH SCORING DO YOU
         EXPECT?
         I DON'T EXPECT A
         WHOET LOCAL OF SCORING
         TONIGHT.
         JAMAICA HAS ONLY
         CONCEDED TWO GOALS IN
         THE ENTIRE TOURNAMENT.
         THE UNITED STATES HAS
         KEPT A CLEAN SHEET IN
         EVERY ONE OF THEIR GOLD
         CUP GAMES.
         THEIR DEFENSE HAS BEEN
         VERY STOUT.
         THE BACK LINE HAS BEEN
         VERY CONSISTENT.
         THEY'VE BEEN TESTED.
         I MEAN, THE
         QUARTERFINALS WITH
         COURASAO.
         THEY HAD GOOD CHANCES
         AS WELL, AND JACK'S
         GOAL HAS BEEN VERY,
         VERY GOOD.
         ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU
         HAVE ANDRE BLAKE.
         HE PLAYS FOR THE
         PHILADELPHIA UNION.
         HE IS ALSO VERY GOOD
         AND CAME UM UP BIG A
         COUPLE OF TIMES IN THAT
         QUARTERFINAL WIN OVER
         PANAMA.
         I DON'T EXPECT A WHOLE
         LOT OF SCORING TONIGHT.
         I EXPECT IT TO BE A
         TIGHT SEMIFINAL LIKE
         LAST NIGHT WITH MEXICO
         AND HAITI.
         AGAIN, TWO AND A HALF
         GOALS SEEMS LIKE A LOT
         TO ME.
         I EXPECT IT TO BE A 1
         -0 AFFAIR FOR SURE.
         DOUG: IN FAVOR OF WHO?
         THE UNITED STATES.
         I WOULD AGREE THAT THE
         UNITED STATES ARE
         SLIGHT FAVORITES, BUT,
         AGAIN, JAMAICA HAS
         PLAYED THEM VERY TOUGH,
         AND JAMAICA HAS GONE
         DEEP IN THIS
         TOURNAMENT, YOU KNOW,
         THE LAST TWO EDITIONS.
         THEY'VE MADE THE FINALS
         TWO TIMES.
         WHEN IT COMES TO THE
         GOLD CUP, JAMAICA IS A
         DIFFICULT TEAM TO BREAK
         DOWN.
         I SEE THE U.S. GETTING
         THROUGH TONIGHT.
         DOUG: SOUNDS GOOD.
         JEFF CARLISLE JOINING
         US FROM NASHVILLE HEAD
         OF TONIGHT'S GOLD CUP
         SEMIFINAL.

         IN THE OVER-UNDER OF
         HOT DOG EATING.
         THAT'S NEXT.  My insurance rates are probably           gonna double.

       I wish for a Biggie       Bag from Wendy's.
    I wish everyone loved each    other and was always...
   That's a great wish, Jimmy.
  Get a Bacon Double stack with  a quarter pound of fresh beef,
   nuggets, fries and a   drink for just five bucks.
  Wendy's Biggie Bag is  everything you could wish for.
  Coach! It's kinda hard to see  the ball.
        I've been there.
  I had a TV service with hardly  any sports in 4K.
 Couldn't see any of the quality details.
 I switched to DIRECTV, now I get the most live sports in 4K.
    So how does that help me?
       It really doesn't.
   I don't know why I told you   that. Go get 'em sport!

         DODOUG: TIME FOR DAILY         DIAMOND DOG, AND THE

         BEST PART IS THE DOG WE         GET TO FEATURE.

         TONIGHT, AND THERE IS
         NO WAY I WANT TO GET IN
         FRONT OF THE WALKER

         SOMETHING THERE WE CAN
         TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IN
         THIS SITUATION.
         ONE OF THOSE STARTS WAS
         AT FENWAY AGAINST
         TORONTO.
         GAVE UP A FEW RUNS.
         DIDN'T EXACTLY WORK
         THAT DEEP INTO THE
         GAME.
         THIS MAY BE A SPOT WE
         CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
         CHRIS SALE, WHO, BY THE
         WAY, THIS IS THE WORST
         HARD-HIT PERCENTAGE OF
         HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
         HIS FAST BALL IS DOWN
         ABOUT A FULL MILE AN
         HOUR OVER HIS RESULTS
         FROM LAST SEASON.
         NOT THE GUY WE SAW LAST
         SEASON.
         STILL A VERY GOOD
         PITCHER.
         BOSTON HAS LOST FIVE OF
         EIGHT, SO THIS COULD BE
         A NICE LITTLE
         OPPORTUNITY HERE TO
         BACK THE DOG AT PLUS

         DOUG: I CAN'T FAULT YOU
         THERE GIVEN THE PRICE
         ON THE DOG.
         I'M GOING TO GO WITH
         THE ROYALS PLUS 145.
         A LITTLE BIT OF A --
         GOING HIGHER.
         IN TWO STARTS SINCE
         RETURNING FROM INJURY
         MIKE LEVINGER HAS
         ALLOWED 12 RUNS.
         SURE LOOKS LIKE HE
         RETURNED TOO QUIBBLE
         ARE FROM THAT BACK
         INJURY.
         SOMETHING DOESN'T SEEM
         RIGHT.
         I'LL TAKE THE ROYALS AT
         HOME, PLUS THE JUICE
         THERE.
         BY THE WAY, IF YOU WANT
         TO SEND IN YOUR DOG, WE
         WILL PROFILE HIM, EVERY
         TIME WE HAVE THIS
         SEGMENT.
         TWEET ME@DOUG ESPN.

         AT 40-1.
         LET'S WELCOME BACK
         ANITA MARKS HERE TO
         TALK A LITTLE GOLF
         GIVEN IT IS A
         WEDNESDAY.
         OF THE FAVORITES,
         ANITA, WHICH ONE GRABS
         YOUR ATTENTION?
         ANITA: 27 WATER
         HAZARDSES, 24 BUNKERS.
         THAT'S WHAT THESE GUIDE
         HAVING FACING, AND
         DECKY HAS BEEN COMING
         IN RED HOT THIS SEASON.
         HE HAS NOT MISSED A
         CUT, DOUG.
         NOT ONE ALL SEASON
         LONG.
         HE IS IN GREAT FORM.
         HE IS RED HOT WITH HIS
         IRONS, AND EACH AND
         EVERY WEEK WE TALK
         ABOUT THE ANALYTICS
         THAT'S GOING TO PLAY
         WELL ON THIS COURSE.
         BIRDIE AVERAGE.
         HE RANKS TENTH ON TOUR.
         PAR FIVE SCORING.
         HE RANKS 25th AND ALSO
         STROKES GAINED, TEE TO
         GREEN, HE RANKS FOURTH
         ON TOUR.
         HE IS UP THERE.
         TOP 25 IN HIS CATEGORY.
         HE IS GOING TO DO
         EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.
         I LIKE HIM.
         I'M PUTTING SOME
         HARD-EARNED MONEY ON
         HIM.
         DOUG: YOU LIKED HIM
         LAST WEEK.
         DID WELL.
         WHAT IS ANOTHER GOLFER
         THAT YOU THINK KIND OF
         GRABS YOUR ATTENTION IN
         TERMS OF VALUE?
         ANITA: PATRICK REEVES.
         HE IS COMING IN TIED
         FOR FIFTH LAST WEEK.
         HE IS COMING IN HOT,
         AND HE IS COMING IN
         WITH A LOT OF
         CONFIDENCE.
         WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
         HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO,
         THE HISTORY IN
         MINNESOTA, LET'S GO
         BACK TO THE 2016 ROOID
         ESH CUP WHERE HE GOT
         THAT NAME CAPTAIN
         AMERICA BECAUSE HE TOOK
         WORRY TO THE LIMIT.
         HIS PUTTING IS A LOT
         BETTER, AND EACH AND
         EVERY WEEK WE LIKE TO
         TALK ABOUT THE GRASS.
         IT'S BENT GRASS THIS
         WEEK.
         THE GREENS AREN'T GOING
         TO BE AS DIFFICULT AS
         SOME OF THESE GUYS HAVE
         SEEN IN PREVIOUS WEEKS.
         I LIKE PATRICK REED.
         DOUG: FIRE AWAY HERE.
         ANITA: AS ALWAYS, THE
         TWO GUYS THAT I FIRST
         TALK ABOUT, MY LONG,
         SHORT ODDS, LIKE TO
         PLAY THEM IN DFS AS
         WELL.
         I'M GOING WITH DEKI AND
         PATRICK.
         DECHAMBEAUX.
         HIS PUTTING IS FINALLY
         COMING BACK, AND HE
         DOES WELL WITH GENEROUS
         FAIRWAYS, AND THAT'S
         WHAT HE WILL SEE
         STARTING TOMORROW.
         NEIMAN, BACK-TO-BACK
         TOP FIVES.
         HIS NEW PUTTING
         PRACTICE THAT HE HAS
         BEEN PRACTICING WITH,
         AND IT'S REALLY BEEN
         HELPING HIM.
         ALSO, 311st STROKES
         GAINED TEE TO GREEN.
         HOMA, THIS GUY MAKES
         EVERY CUT.
         48th PAR FIVE SCORING,
         AND HERE'S THE THING.
         THREE PAR FIVES, 593
         YARDS, 596 YARDS.
         THERE'S SOME LONG PAR
         FIVES, AND REDMAN IS
         COMING IN RED HOT AS
         WELL.
         SECOND LAST WEEK WITH
         19 UNDER ON THE
         TOURNAMENT.
         THIS IS HIS THIRD PGA
         START, AND THIS VERY
         WELL COULD BE IF HE
         WINS, THIS VERY WELL
         COULD BE THE FOURTH
         STRAIGHT WEEK ON THE
         PGA TOUR THAT WE HAVE
         THESE REALLY SURPRISING
         GREAT WINNERS, SO I'M
         ALWAYS ABOUT THAT.
         I LOVE THE UNDER DOG.
         I LOVE THE UNEXPECTED,
         SO I'M REALLY, REALLY,
         REALLY CHEERING FOR
         REDMAN.
         SOUNDS GOOD.
         ANITA, THANKS FOR THE
         INSIGHT.
         ENJOY YOUR HOLIDAY, AND
         YOU'LL BE BACK
         OBVIOUSLY ON THE SHOW
         ON FRIDAY.
         ANITA: YES.
         I'LL BE IN FOR YOU.
         HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A
         GREAT WEEKEND.
         DOUG: I WILL.
         AND STRAIGHT AHEAD ON
         THIS SHOW, THE GREATEST
         EMCEE IN SHORTS, GEORGE
         SHAY, WILL BREAK DOWN
         TOMORROW'S HOT DOG
         EATING CONTEST.
         TO ME THAT'S THE
         GREATEST HONOR OF THIS
         SPORT IS TO BE ABLE TO
         INTRODUCE JOEY CHESTNUT
         BECAUSE TO ME HE IS
         AMERICA ITSELF.
         TO ME HE IS FREEDOM.
         HE IS THE ESSENCE OF
         WHO WE ARE.
         [ dogs barking ]
         <i> What about him?</i>

         DOUG: THE CHAMPIONSHIP         IS SET FOR THE WOMEN'S
         WORLD CUP.
         OBVIOUSLY, THE
         AMERICANS ADVANCE.
         TODAY NETHERLANDS GET
         THE 99th MINUTE.

         THAT IS YOUR SHOWDOWN,

         POSTING THESE ODDS.
         THE AMERICANS MINUS 475
         TO HOIST THE TROPHY.

         WILL BE OUT LATER.
         JUST NO MATTER WHEN IT
         OCCURS, U.S. NEARLY A
         5-1 FAVORITE OVER
         NETHERLANDS.
         THAT IS SUNDAY.
         LET'S GET READY FOR
         TOMORROW.
         IT IS A STAPLE ON OUR
         INDEPENDENCE DAY.
         THE NATHAN'S HOT DOG
         EATING CONTEST.
         AND HERE IS --
         THROUGH MEDITATION,
         HE LEARNED THAT HIS
         SPIRIT ANIMAL IS A
         BALONEY SANDWICH.
         HE HAS THE BODY OF A --
         AND THE EATING HABITS
         OF HOMER SIMPSON.
         HE IS NOT BOOKMARKED.
         IF YOU ASKED HIM TO
         NAME A COUNTRY IN
         CENTRAL AMERICA, HE
         WILL SAY KANSAS?
         THE DIFFICULTY IN HIS
         MARRIAGE BEGAN AFTER HE
         NAMED HIS CHILDREN
         MILD, MEDIUM, AND HOT.
         HIS GOOD CHOLESTEROL IS
         LOW.
         HIS BAD CHOLESTEROL IS
         HIGH.
         AND HIS BMI IS
         BORDERLINE
         PRESIDENTIAL.
         WHEN WE ARE YOUNG, WE
         DRINK OUR COFFEE WITH
         MILK AND SUGAR, AND AS
         WE AGE WE DRINK IT WITH
         MILK ONLY.
         THEN WE DRINK IT BLACK.
         THEN WE DRINK IT DECAF.
         THEN WE DIE.
         OUR NEXT SCENERY IS AT
         DECAF.
         IT IS AN HONOR TO ALL
         THOSE NEW LIVING TO
         BEHOLD THIS MAN.
         HE IS THE -CENTER OF
         OUR NATION
         ONE NATION, UNDER
         GOD, INDIF IZIBLE
         HE IS CHAMPION.
         JOEY CHESTNUT!
         DOUG: WE ARE NOW
         PLEASED TO WELCOME IN
         THE VOICE AND THE
         BIGGEST PERSONALITY OF
         THE JULY 4th HOT DOG
         EATING CONTEST, GEORGE
         SHAY.
         GEORGE, THANKS SO MUCH
         FOR TAKING THE TIME.
         LET'S GET INTO IT.
         JOEY CHESTNUT.
         HE IS A RECORD 11
         MUSTARD BELTS.
         IS THERE ANY CHANCE HE
         DOES NOT WIN THIS
         EVENT?
         OH, I THINK THERE'S
         ABSOLUTELY A CHANCE HE
         DOESN'T WIN, BUT I
         THINK THE ODDS WOULD BE
         EXTREMELY LOW.
         NOT ONLY IS HE DOMINANT
         IN THIS SPORT.
         74 HOT DOGS AND BUNS
         LAST YEAR IN TEN
         MINUTES.
         ON TOP OF THAT I SAW
         HIM TODAY.
         HE LOOKS ABSOLUTELY IN
         TOP FORM.
         HE IS VERY TRIM, VERY
         FIT.
         HE IS VERY HEALTHY AND
         REST AND CONFIDENT.
         I THINK HE IS GOING TO
         BE COMING IN STRONG,
         BUT AT ANY TIME HE
         COULD BE BEATEN, AND
         THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
         GUYS.
         JEFF AND MATT COULD
         TAKE HIM DOWN.
         DOUG: TALK MORE ABOUT
         THOSE TWO KIND OF
         CONTENDERS, IF YOU
         WILL.
         WHAT MAKES THEM --
         WHAT'S THE PATH TO
         THEIR SUCCESS AND
         BEATING JOEY CHESTNUT?
         WELL, BOTH OF THEM
         HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY,
         AND JEFFREY ESPER HAD
         BEATEN JOEY CHESTNUT,
         IF I'M CORRECT, TWO
         TIMES IN THE LAST THREE
         WEEKS.
         HE GOT HIM IN HOSTESS,
         AND HE GOT HIM IN
         CHICKEN WINGS.
         HE IS A MONSTER.
         HE IS A RELATIVE
         ROOKIE.
         SECOND, THIRD YEAR ON
         THE CIRCUIT.
         I THINK HE GETS A
         LITTLE BIT OF THE
         JITTERS GOING INTO THE
         BIG CONTEST ON THE
         FOURTH OF JULY.
         HE ATE 51 HOT DOGS TO
         QUALIFY.
         KEEP IN MIND, THE
         QUALIFYING HOT DOGS ARE
         HARDER TO EAT.
         YOU REALLY HAVE TO
         THINK OF HIM UP AT A 60
         MARK OR SO.
         THEN THERE'S ALSO MATT
         STONY.
         HE IS REALLY AN
         INTERNET STAR NOW.
         A YOUTUBE STAR.
         DOUG: A COUPLE OF
         THINGS TO DIGEST.
         FORGIVE THE PUN.
         QUALIFYING HOT DOGS ARE
         HARDER TO EAT.
         WHY IS THAT?
         WELL, IF YOU THINK
         OF IT -YOU ARE AT
         NATHAN'S, THE MECCA OF
         HOT DOGS, AND THEY'RE
         COOKED PERFECTLY COOKED
         ON THE GRITLE, AND
         THEY'RE COOKED TO COME
         OFF A FEW MINUTES PRIOR
         TO THE CONTEST.
         THEY'RE THE PERFECT
         TEMPERATURE.
         THEY'RE WARM.
         THEY'RE NOT COLD OR
         HOT.
         WHEN YOU ARE OUT THE
         CIRCUIT, YOU MIGHT BE
         AT A BALLPARK.
         THEY'RE BRINGING THE
         HOT DOGS IN IN WARMERS.
         THEY'VE BEEN COOKED A
         HALF AN HOUR, AN HOUR
         BEFORE.
         SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT
         FULLY GRITLED.
         THEY'RE JUST COOKED OR
         THEY'RE STEAMED, BUT
         NOT GRILLED AS THEY
         WOULD BE AT CONEY
         ISLAND, AND AS A
         RESULT, THEY'RE MORE
         DIFFICULT TO EAT.
         OR IT TAKES LONGER TO
         EAT THOSE DOGS.
         FASCINATING STUFF.
         CHESTNUT EIGHT ATE 72
         HOT DOGS.
         DO YOU SEE HIM GOING
         PAST THAT MARK AS WELL
         THIS YEAR?
         I ABSOLUTELY THINK
         HE WILL BE AROUND
         THERE.
         THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES
         WHEN THINGS DROP OFF.
         IT COULD BE THE
         TEMPERATURE OF THE DAY.
         IT COULD BE LITERALLY
         THE HUMIDITY.
         ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU HAVE
         A VERY, VERY DRY DAY,
         IT CAN DRY OUT THE
         BUNS, SO EVEN IF
         THEY'RE ONLY OUT THERE
         FOR FIVE OR TEN
         MINUTES, THEY HAVE A
         DIFFERENT CONSISTENCY.
         THE HOT DOGS CAN
         TIGHTEN UP MORE.
         THE TEMPERATURE COULD
         PLAY A ROLE.
         DOUG: MICKEY GOING FOR
         A SIXTH STRAIGHT
         MUSTARD BELT.
         WHAT ARE THE CHANCES IN
         YOUR EYES SHE DOES NOT
         MAKE IT SIX STRAIGHT?
         I THINK THEY'RE LOW.
         THE CHANCES THAT SHE
         DOES NOT WIN.
         YOU KNOW, SHE -THERE
         COULD BE MORE
         VARIABILITY IN HER
         PERFORMANCE ON THAT.
         DUG THE WHOLE SPECTACLE
         IS AWESOME.
         I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCH
         IT ON JULY 4th.
         IT WAS AN HONOR TO HAVE
         YOU HERE.
         I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
         WATCHING YOUR
         PERFORMANCE AS WELL.
         THANK YOU FOR TAKING
         THE TIME?
         THANK YOU FOR HAVING
         ME.
         DOUG: AND ON THAT NOTE,
         WE GO TO PROP CULTURE
         TO WRAP UP THE SHOW.
         JOE JOINS ME NOW.
         JOE, LOOK, TOTAL OF HOT
         DOGS ON THE MEN'S
         DIVISION, 73 1/2, AND
         THIS IS INTERESTING.
         I LOVE WHAT EMMY GEORGE
         SHAY JUST SAID ABOUT
         MATT STONY, WHO HE IS
         HEARING GRUMBLINGS THAT
         HE IS GOING TO REALLY
         BRING IT THIS YEAR, AND
         ENORMOUS CAPACITY.
         I HAVE BEEN TRACKING
         THIS STUFF FOR A LONG
         TIME WHEN I WORKED IN
         LAS VEGAS.
         I GOT TO DO A LIVE SHOT
         DOWNTOWN WITH THE ONE
         AND ONLY JOEY CHESTNUT
         AND THE ONE AND ONLY
         KOBAYASHI.
         THEY WERE TALKING TRASH
         TO ONE ANOTHER.
         A LOT OF FUN.
         I'M NO EXPERT, BUT I'M
         STAYING UNDER 73 1/2 IF
         I HAD TO, JOE.
         JOE: SHADES OF DAVIS
         FROST AND RICHARD
         NIXON, NO DOUBT.
         NOW, I'M GOING OVER
         73 1/2 HOT DOGS, AND I
         GOT JOEY CHESTNUT
         WINNING THIS THING.
         JOEY CHESTNUT LIVES
         HERE IN THE BAY AREA
         WHERE I LIVE.
         THE LAND OF KALE.
         THE LAND OF AVOCADO
         TOAST, SODA TAXES.
         IF YOU THINK ABOUT
         HAVING A CHEESEBURGER,
         THEY WANT TO CAST YOU
         OUT.
         BEAUTIFUL AREA, NO
         DOUBT, BUT THEY ARE NOT
         TOO FOND OF NASHING
         73 1/2 HOT DOGS IN TEN
         MINUTES.
         THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE
         DO THINGS HERE, AND,
         YET, JOEY CHESTNUT
         RISES EVERY DAY IN THE
         FACE OF THAT ADVERSITY,
         AND HE TAKES ON HIS
         DETRACTORS.
         LET'S GO BACK TO 20 IS
         A WHEN HE LOST TO MATT
         STONY.
         62 TO 60.
         CAME BACK THE NEXT YEAR
         TO SET A RECORD WITH 70
         HOT DOGS.
         CAME BACK THE FOLLOWING
         YEAR TO SET A RECORD
         WITH 72 HOT DOGS AND
         THEN CAME BACK LAST
         YEAR TO SET ANOTHER
         RECORD WITH 74 HOT
         DOGS.
         THIS GUY IS NOT WORRIED
         ABOUT HIS COMPETITION.
         HE IS WORRIED ABOUT
         HISTORY, AND HE HAS
         STATED THAT HIS GOAL IS
         TO KNOCK DOWN 80 HOT
         DOGS IN A SINGLE
         SITTING.
         DOUG, I THINK TO YOU,
         GOD BLESS JOEY
         CHESTNUT.
         GOD BLESS AMERICA.
         DOUG: AND WEATHER ON
         YOUR SIDE, JOE.
         IT'S GOING TO BE A
         HUMID DAY, AND GEORGE
         SHAY WAS JUST SAYING
         THAT THAT LENDS ITSELF
         TO THE OVER BECAUSE THE
         BUNS WON'T DRY OUT.
         THEN I DIDN'T THINK OF
         ASKING HIM A LOT OF THE
         COMPETITORS DIP THE BUN
         IN THE WATER, SO I'M A
         LITTLE CONFUSED.
         I HAVE CERTAIN
         THRESHOLDS FOR
         EXPERTISE ON THE HOT
         DOG EATING CONTEST.
         I DO KNOW THAT I WILL
         BE WATCHING, AND THIS
         ISN'T LIKE THOSE OTHER
         SPORTS LIKE FOOTBALL --
         THEY ONLY WATCHED THE
         LAST FEW MINUTES.
         YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE
         BEGINNING BECAUSE OF
         GEORGE SHAY AND ALL THE
         INTRODUCTIONS AND THE
         POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
         AS WELL.
         JOE, WE APPRECIATE IT.
         I KNOW WHO YOU ARE
         ROOTING FOR HERE.
         YOUR HOMETOWN GUY, AND
         MORE IMPORTANTLY, HAPPY
         FOURTH OF JULY AND
         ENJOY YOUR HOLIDAY, MY
         FRIEND.
         AND RECAPPING OUR BEST
         BETS, PRESTON, THE
         VEGAS GRIZZLIES MINUS

         JOE ON THE UNDERDOG
