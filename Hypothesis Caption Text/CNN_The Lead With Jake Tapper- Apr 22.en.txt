 SO, YOU KNOW, DO THEY DO A SERIES OF HEARINGS OR DO THEY GO
 IMMEDIATELY TO IT?
 I THINK MOST DEMOCRATS WHO ARE
 IN LEADERSHIP, WHO ARE LEADING
 COMMITTEES WANT TO DO HEARINGS
 FIRST.
 IN PART BECAUSE THEY THINK THE
 PUBLIC CASE NEEDS TO BE BUILT.
 A LOT OF THE STUFF IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT WASN'T TOTALLY
 SHOCKING, AS IT'S BEEN REPORTED.
 AND THEY NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE
 TESTIFY, HAVE DRAMATIC MOMENTS,
 SO THAT THE PUBLIC IS BEHIND
 THEM A LITTLE BIT.
 OR THEY CAN SEE THAT.
 AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE
 CALCULATION THAT THEY'RE MAKING
 BILL, ONE OF THE OTHER FEARS,
 AS YOU HEARD CONGRESSWOMAN
 HOLMES NORTON SAY IS THAT THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE, IF THERE ARE
 ALL OF THESE HEARINGS, IN WHICH
 ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE STORIES
 ABOUT DONALD TRUMP COME OUT,
 THERE AREN'T THE SAME HEARINGS
 AND ATTENTION, AT LEAST, ON
 HEALTH CARE, JOBS, THINGS THAT
 VOTERS OUT THERE CARE ABOUT MORE
 THAN THEY DO ABOUT IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS.
 I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE
 OVERTHINKING THIS.
 THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATE WILL LAY OUT A PROGRAM
 ON HEALTH CARE, JOBS, AND ALL OF
 THAT.
 IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO MAKE
 IT THROUGH THE SENATE OR GET
 SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT.
 SO, FINE, THEY CAN HAVE A
 HEARING HERE AND GO TO THE FLOOR
 OF THE HEALTH CARE BILL THERE.
 I DON'T THINK THIS IS ASKING TOO
 MUCH OF THEM.
 AND I THINK THE DYNAMIC NOW IS
 GOING TO SET IN.
 IF YOU TAKE THE REPORT
 SERIOUSLY, IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY
 THERE SHOULDN'T AT LEAST BE
 HEARINGS TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED,
 WITH FACT WITNESSES LIKE DON
 McGAHN.
 ONCE THREE HEARINGS HAPPEN, YOU
 CAN DO THEM FASTER OR SLOWER.
 AT SOME POINT, UYOU'LL HAVE TO
 SAY, WE'VE HAD THE HEARINGS,
 WHAT DO WE DO.
 MAYBE YOU AGREE YOU CAN CENSURE
 THE PRESIDENT IF YOU CAN GET
 SOME REPUBLICANS ONBOARD.
 BUT THE IDEA THIS IS GOING TO
 FIZZLE OUT, I DON'T BUY THAT.
 AND I DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATS
 WILL PAY A PRICE FOR GOING IN AN
 ORDERLY, VERY LEGALISTIC WAY,
 TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT, PERHAPS
 VOTING FOR IMPEACHMENT, IT WILL
 FAIL IN THE SENATE AND WE'LL
 HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
 I DON'T THINK THIS DAMAGES THE
 DEMOCRATS IN ANY IMPORTANT WAY.
 I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT
 STEPHEN MOORE, THE PRESIDENT'S
 PICK TO SERVE ON THE FEDERAL
 RESERVE BOARD.
 SABRINA'S K-FILE FOUND A COLUMN
 THAT HE WROTE IN WHICH HE
 ASSAILED THE IDEA OF WOMEN
 PARTICIPATING AS REFEREES IN
 PROFESSIONAL SPORTS.
 HE ATTACKED FEMALE ATHLETES
 PUSHING FOR EQUAL PAY, SAYING
 THEY WANTED EQUAL PAY FOR
 INFERIOR WORK.
 HE MOCKED A READER WHO CALLED
 HIS COLUMN SEXIST.
 IN 2002, STEPHEN MOORE WROTE,
 HERE'S THE RULE CHANGE I
 PROPOSE, NO WOMEN ANYTHING,
 THERE IS, OF COURSE, AN
 EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE, WOMEN
 ARE PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IF
 AND ONLY THEY LOOK LIKE BONNIE
 BERNSTEIN.
 THE FACT THAT BONNIE KNOWS
 NOTHING ABOUT BASKETBALL IS
 ENTIRELY IRRELEVANT, UNQUOTE.
 HE LATER WROTE THAT BERNSTEIN,
 WHO WAS A CBS SPORTS JOURNALIST
 AT THE TIME SHOULD WEAR HALTER
 STOPS.
 MOORE SAID THIS IS A SPOOF, HE'S
 JUST JOKING, HE HAS A SENSE OF
 HUMOR.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?
 I THINK PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING
 TO FIND OUT WHAT THE JOKE IS IN
 THE COLUMNS THAT HE WROTE.
 IT'S NOT SOME FLIPPANT COMMENT
 HE MADE.
 HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO
 EXPRESS THESE VIEWS, WHETHER HE
 THOUGHT THEY WERE FUNNY OR NOT,
 AND TO DO SO IN NOT JUST ONE
 ISOLATED CASE, BUT IN MULTIPLE
 WRITINGS.
 AND I THINK THIS IS REFLECTIVE
 OF A BROADER ATTITUDE TOWARDS
 WOMEN THAT EMANATES FROM THE TOP
 LEVEL OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
 THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS MADE A
 LOT OF DEROGATORY COMMENTS WHEN
 IT COMES TO WOMEN.
 AND SO FOR MANY PEOPLE, THEY
 MAG
 MIGHT SAY THERE WAS A PROBLEM
 HERE IN THIS VETTING THIS
 CANDIDATE.
 BUT QUITE FRANKLY, THIS WHITE
 HOUSE HAS SHOWN TIME AND AGAIN
 WHEN THEY HAVE THESE NOMINEES
 THAT HAVE COME UNDER
 CONTROVERSY, THE ADMINISTRATION
 HAS STOOD BY THEM.
 AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT
 HIMSELF BELIEVES THAT THESE ARE
 THE PEOPLE HE WANTS FOR THE JOB.
 AND THERE ARE OTHER CHALLENGES
 WITH STEPHEN MOORE AND
 REPUBLICANS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS
 OVER THE FACT THAT HE IS A
 POLITICAL OPERATIVE AND SO THAT
 IS AT ODDS WITH WHAT YOU
 TRADITIONALLY SEE FOR NOMINEES,
 TRADITIONALLY INDEPENDENT
 FEDERAL RESERVE.
 AND I FIND IT CHALLENGING TO
 THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH
 SUPPORT FOR HIM IN A
 REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE.
 AND THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED
 TODAY THAT HERMAN CAIN, WHO WAS
 ALSO UP FOR A POSITION ON THE
 FEDERAL RESERVE, HAS TAKEN
 HIMSELF OUT OF THE RUNNING.
 REPUBLICAN SENATOR TOLD ME,
 HERMAN CAIN JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE
 VOTES.
 HERMAN CAIN WAS NEVER GOING
 TO MAKE IT THAT FAR.
 REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL KNEW
 THAT AND THEY WERE MAKING IT
 PRETTY CLEAR TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
 PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE
 GOT THAT MESSAGE.
 SO THEY THOUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO
 OF THESE, STEPHEN MOORE WAS MORE
 LIKELY TO ADVANCE, TO ACTUALLY
 HAVE AN ATTEMPT TO GET ON IT AND
 GO UNDER CONFIRMATION.
 THEY DID NOT THINK THAT HERMAN
 CAIN WAS GOING TO MAKE IT
 ANYWAYS.
 IN ADDITION TO THE QUESTIONS
 ABOUT HIS QUALIFICATIONS,
 QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
 HE HAD SEXUALLY HARASSED WOMEN
 IN HIS PREVIOUS POSITION, HE
 DENIES THAT.
 EVERYONE, STICK AROUND.

 TERRORIST ATTACKS SINCE 9/11.

 A FIFTH GRADE BOY FROM

 JAKE?
 SAM KILEY IN SRI LANKA, THANK
 YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT REPORT.
 JOINING ME NOW IS FORMER CIA
 COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST, PHIL
 MUDD, AND FORMER FBI SUPERVISORY
 SPECIAL AGENT, JOSH CAMPBELL.
 EXCUSE ME, JOSH, EXCUSE ME.
 BOTTOM LINE, WAS THIS AN
 INTELLIGENCE FAILURE?
 I THINK IT'S TOO SOON TO SAY
 THAT, JAKE.
 WHEN I WAS IN THE FBI, I SERVED
 ON ONE OF OUR GLOBAL TEAMS
 RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING
 INVESTIGATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 AND WE ROUTINELY SHARED
 INFORMATION WITH OUR
 COUNTERPARTS.
 WE DON'T KNOW YET IF THIS IS
 INFORMATION THAT CAME FROM
 WESTERN OFFICIALS, BUT IF THAT'S
 THE CASE, I'VE SEEN THESE TYPES
 OF REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED
 OVER SOMETIMES.
 THEY'RE VERY RICH IN DETAIL,
 SOMETIMES THEY'RE VERY VAGUE.
 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT INFORMATION
 WAS PASSED ON YET.
 ONCE WE GET A GREATER SENSE OF
 WHAT THAT IS, THEN WE'LL BE IN A
 BETTER POSITION TO DECIDE
 WHETHER THIS IS A FAILURE.
 I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SNEEZE.
 IT IS POLLEN SEASON HERE IN
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 PHIL, I WANT TO ASK ABOUT WHAT
 JOSH JUST SAID.
 BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU HEAR,
 THERE'S A WARNING AND THE
 GOVERNMENT DIDN'T HEAR IT.
 FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE
 WARNING THAT THE UNITED STATES
 PROVIDED, THAT INDIA PROVIDED,
 IS THAT ENOUGH THAT COULD HAVE
 PREVENTED THIS HORRIFIC ATTACK?
 I MEAN, AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT
 DIDN'T SAY, THESE ATTACKE
 GOIN TARGETING CHRISTIANS
 WORSHIPING ON EASTER.
 IF YOU WANT TO STUDY A
 WARNING, I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO
 LOOK FOR A FEW SPECIFICS.
 YOU HAVE TIME, PLACE, PEOPLE,
 DEVICE.
 THOSE FOUR CHARACTERISTICS.
 IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL WARNING
 SOMETHING MIGHT BE COMING UP IN
 A COUNTRY OF 22 MILLION, 23
 MILLION PEOPLE, IN MY
 INTELLIGENCE WORLD, YOU HAVE TO
 HAVE SPECIFICITY TO GO TO
 OFFICIALS AND SAY, HERE'S THE
 PLACE YOU WANT TO GUARD, HERE'S
 THE KIND OF DEVICE YOU MIGHT
 WANT TO LOOK AT, HERE'S WHAT THE
 CELL LOOKS LIKE.
 A GENERIC WARNING MIGHT SOUND
 UGLY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
 IN MY WORLD, THAT'S A DIME A
 DOZEN.
 YOU NEED MORE THAN THAT.
 AND THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION
 HERE WAS EXTRAORDINARY.
 THREE DIFFERENT CITIES, EIGHT
 DIFFERENT EXPLOSIONS, CHURCHES
 WERE TARGETED, WESTERN HOTELS
 WERE TARGETED.
 WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT
 WHO CONDUCTED THIS?
 YEAH, NO QUESTION THIS WAS
 HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED.
 AND WE'VE HEARD REPORTS THAT
 THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ISIS
 INSPIRED.
 I TEND TO SUSPECT THAT'S
 PROBABLY THE CASE HERE BASED ON
 A NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS.
 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 DIRECTED AND INSPIRED.
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN AN ACTUAL CLAIM
 OF RESPONSIBILITY COMING OUT
 FROM ISIS.
 BUT THIS IS THE ONE THING THAT
 WE'VE ALL WORRIED ABOUT, PEOPLE
 GOING TO THE BATTLEFIELD AND
 WHERE DO DAY GO NEXT?
 WHERE DO THEY TAKE THAT HATRED?
 AND THIS IS EARLY ON, BUT IT
 APPEARS THIS TYPE OF INSPIRATION
 WAS AT LEAST AT PLAY HERE.
 PHIL, TAKE A LISTEN TO THE
 SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO
 SPEAKING TODAY ON THE THREAT
 FROM ISIS AND OTHER TERRORIST
 GROUPS.
 THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
 CALIPHATE WAS IMPORTANT AND IT
 MATTERED.
 AND THE TAKEDOWN OF THESE
 THREATS FROM OTHER GEOGRAPHIES
 AS WELL.
 BUT, SADLY, THIS EVIL EXISTS IN
 THE WORLD.
 "WE HAVE TAKEN DOWN THE
 THREAT SUBSTANTIALLY, BUT
 OBVIOUSLY, THE EVIL DOES EXIST
 IN THE WORLD."
 IS THERE -I MEAN, ASSUMING
 THIS GROUP WAS ISIS INSPIRED,WH
 INTELLIGENCE THINKS NOW, I MEAN,
 DOES THAT -IS THERE ANYTHING
 THAT CHANGED VIS-A-VIS SYRIA AND
 IRAQ AND THE DEFEAT OF ISIS AND
 THE CALIPHATE, THE GEOGRAPHICAL
 CALIPHATE THERE VERSUS SRI
 LANKA.
 DOES IT HAVE ANY EFFECT?
 YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE, DESPITE
 THIS EVENT TODAY, THAT THE
 THREAT DIMINISHES OVER TIME.
 FOR EXAMPLE, IN EUROPE COMPARED
 TO WHERE WE WERE THREE, FOUR
 YEARS AGO, YOU CAN'T GET TO
 SYRIA TO TRAIN.
 SO BY DEFINITION, YOU'LL HAVE
 FEWER PEOPLE COMING BACK WITH
 HIGH TECH SKILLS.
 THAT SAID, THIS IDEA THAT A
 GEOGRAPHICAL FATE AND THE
 DECLINE OF A GEOGRAPHICAL FATE
 IS THE END GAME, ISIS AND KAL
 QAEDA WERE IDEAS THAT CAN BE
 DISSEMINATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
 THAT'S SEEN RIGHT NOW IN SRI
 LANKA, SO LET'S NOT FOCUS TOO
 MUCH ON STATEMENTS ABOUT THE
 DECLINE OF CALIPHATE.
 I WANT TO SEE THE DECLINE OF THE
 IDEA.
 PHIL MUDD AND JOSH CAMPBELL,
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 WE ARE JUST HOURS AWAY FROM ONE
 OF THE BUSIEST NIGHTS AND THE
 BIGGEST NIGHTS OF THE 2020
 CAMPAIGN SO FAR, AS THE
 DEMOCRATIC FIELD KEEPS GROWING.

 VETERAN TURNED CONGRESSMAN SETH
 MOULTON OF MASSACHUSETTS
 ANNOUNCED THAT HE, TOO, IS
 RUNNING IN 2020.
 BUT AS HE LAUNCHES HIS CAMPAIGN,
 A DIFFERENT HIGH-PROFILE NAME

 WE'RE LEARNING HOW FORMER VICE

 PLANNING HIS CAMPAIGN ROLLOUT
 THIS WEEK.

 Reporter: SETH MOULTON
 LAUNCHING HIS CAMPAIGN MONDAY.
 BUT MOULTON'S ENTRANCE WON'T BE
 THEP■ , WITH THE
 ■■ OWN
 CAMPAIGN.
 SOURCES TELL CNN VICE PRESIDENT
 JOE BIDEN WHO LEADS THE FEEL IN
 NATIONAL AND EARLY PRIMARY
 CAUCUS STATE POLLING WILL PUT AN
 END TO THE LONG-RUN WILLING HE
 OR WON'T HE?
 BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE
 HIS CANDIDACY IN A VIDEOBS
 WEEK, FOLLOWED BY TRAVEL TO
 EARLY PRIMARY STATES NEXT WEEK.
 BIDEN WOULD MAKE IT AN
 ASTOUNDING 20 CANDIDATES
 OFFICIALLY RUNNING TO TAKE ON
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020, WITH
 DISPARATE RECORDS, MESSAGES, AND
 POTENTIAL COALITIONS, A FACT
 THAT UNDERSCORES THE EFFORTS BY
 ELIZABETH WARREN TO BREAK OUT ON
 POLICY.
 WARREN ON MONDAY RELEASING THE
 MOST SWEEPING, AGGRESSIVE PLAN
 TO CURTAIL THE ESTIMATED $1.5
 TRILLION IN STUDENT LOAN DEAD, A
 $1.25 TRILLION PLAN TO CANCEL
 LOAN DEBT UP TO $50,000 FOR
 HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN
 $100,000, IMPLEMENT FREE PUBLIC
 COLLEGE, AND EXPAND GRANTS FOR
 LOWER INCOME AND MINORITY
 STUDENTS FOR HOUSING, FOOD, AND
 BOOKS.
 IT'S NOT JUST PAYING THE
 TUITION.
 IT'S HOW THEY PAY FOR BOOKS.
 IT'S HOW THEY PAY FOR THE
 EXPENSES OF HAVING A BABY TAKEN
 CARE OF IF THEY ALREADY HAVE A
 CHILD AT HOME OR BEING ABLE TO
 COVER COMMUTING EXPENSES.
 OR MAYBE IT'S A CHANCE TO LIVE
 IN A DORM AND HAVE THE KIND OF
 COLLEGE EXPERIENCE THAT OTHER
 KIDS GET.
 Reporter: WARREN TO PITCH
 THAT PLANND MORE TONIGHT ON
 CNN, WHEN SHE AND FOUR OTHER
 CANDIDATES TAKE PART IN SERIES
 OF TOWN HALLS FROM NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, A PRIME-TIME EVENT
 FOR FIVE TOP-TIER CANDIDATES,
 ALL LOOKING TO BREAK OUT OF AN
 INCREASINGLY EXPANDING PACK.
 AND JAKE, SENATOR WARREN'S
 ADVISERS MADE CLEAR THAT SHE
 WILL MAKE CRYSTAL CLEAR TONIGHT
 IN THE TOWN HALL THAT HER LANE,
 THE ONE OF IN THE WEEDS POLICY
 PROPOSALS, IS BOAST DURABLE AND
 SOMETHING THAT WILL EVENTUALLY
 LEAD HER BACK INTO THE TOP TIER
 OF CANDIDATES.
 IT'S A GAMBLE, ONE THEY
 ACKNOWLEDGE, BUT ONE THEY
 BELIEVE, EVEN THOUGH THERE'S
 LAGGING FUND-RAISING AND LAGGING
 POLL NUMBERS, THAT WILL
 EVENTUALLY PAY OFF.
 PHIL MATTINGLY IN NEW  THANK
 PHIL.
 AND SPEAKING OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,
 WE'RE LEARNING THAT BIDEN IS
 PLANNING TO VISIT IOWA THIS
 WEEK, BUT HE TRAILS IN Añ■■■■■ç

 SO I HAVE TO SAY, THAT IS A
 STRONGER SHOWING THAN I WOULD
 HAVE THOUGHT FOR BUTTIGIEG AND
 A -I MEAN, SECOND PLACE, IT'S
 NOT BAD, BUT A WEAKER SHOWING
 THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT FOR
 BIDEN, WHO HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN
 CAMPAIGNING FOR PRESIDENT OFF
 AND ON SINCE 1987.
 RIGHT, I THINK IT'S STILL
 VERY MUCH A WIDE OPEN FIELD AND
 IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE
 DETERMINATIONS BASED ON THE
 EARLY POLLING, ESPECIALLY BEFORE
 ANY OF THESE CANDIDATES APPEAR
 ON THE DEBATE STAGE.
 NOW, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR BERNIE
 SANDERS OR JOE BIDEN, THE PEOPLE
 WHO HAVE THE MOST NAME
 RECOGNITION TO BE AT THE TOP OF
 THE PACK.
 IT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN IMPRESSIVE
 TO MANY PEOPLE THAT MAYOR PETE
 BUTTIGIEG, WHO IS RELATIVELY
 UNKNOWN UNTIL JUST A COUPLE OF
 MONTHS AGO, AS SORT OF SHOT TO
 THIS TOP TIER OF CANDIDATES IN
 THE EYES OF MANY.
 I THINK A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS
 THAT WILL BE RESOLVED IN THE
 EYES OF VOTERS WILL BE TWOFOLD.
 THERE WILL BE THE POLICY
 DISAGREEMENTS AND WHAT
 VARIATIONS ON HEALTH CARE OR A
 FREE COLLEGE TUITION OR
 EDUCATION, YOU KNOW, THE POLICY
 PROPOSALS THAT THEY WILL PUT
 OUT.
 AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE'S THE
 ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, WHICH IS,
 WHAT WILL BE THEIR APPROACH TO
 TAKING ON DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT
 ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AROUND
 IMPEACHMENT AND THE POST-MUELLER
 DEBATE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO
 HAVE TO CONTEND WITH AS
 CANDIDATES.
 SPEAKING OF COLLEGE LOAN
 DEBT, BERNIE SANDERS IN 2016
 CAMPAIGNED HEAVILY ON A PLAN OF
 FREE TUITION.
 ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS HER NEW
 PLAN GOES FURTHER, BECAUSE IT
 ADDS ON GETTING RID OF STUDENT
 LOAN DEBT.
 DO YOU BUY HER ARGUMENT THAT
 EVENTUALLY ALL OF THESE POLICY
 ROLLOUTS ARE GOING TO PAY OFF
 FOR HER?
 I HAVE TO SAY, 4%, SHE'S FROM
 NEIGHBORING MASSACHUSETTS.
 SHE ALSO IS A NATIONAL FIGURE
 AND A KNOWN ENTITY.
 THAT IS NOT AS STRONG A SHOWING
 AS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AMONG
 NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS.
 I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
 AND IF YOU'RE HER TEAM, I THINK
 YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO
 HAVE TRACTION AT THIS POINT.
 OBVIOUSLY, SHE WINS THE POLICY
 PRIMARY, BUT WINNING THE POLICY
 PRIMARY DOESN'T TYPICALLY WIN
 THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY.
 SHE CAME OUT STRONGLY FOR
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I THINK THAT WAS CLEARLY AN
 EFFORT TO GAIN TRACTION AT TIME
 WHEN SHE WAS NOT.
 SHE ALSO HAS BEEN SPENDING
 ALMOST AS SHE'S BEEN RAISING SO
 IF YOU'RE ON HER INTERNAL TEAM,
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RACE RIGHT
 NOW AND YOU'RE THINKING, WE HAVE
 COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GAIN
 TRACTION AND REALLY MAKE A MOVE
 HERE.
 SHE WAS BERNIE SANDERS ARGUABLY
 BEFORE BERNIE SANDERS WAS BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 AND SHE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE RUN
 FOUR YEARS AGO.
 AND SHE MAYBE COULD HAVE WON THE
 PRIMARY, BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER
 AT THIS POINT.
 I THINK AT THIS POINT, SHE HAS
 TO DECIDE IF SHE CAN MAKE
 TRACTION TO STILL BE IN THE RACE
 IN THE FALL.
 OF COURSE, THE INEVITABLE
 QUESTION, WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR
 IT, WILL IT'S STUDENT LOAN DEAD
 OR COLLEGE TUITION.
 ELIZABETH WARREN PREEMPTIVELY
 PUT OUT A PLAN TO TAX WHAT SHE
 CALLS THE VERY RICH, AND SAYS
 THAT WILL HELP WITH OTHER WAYS
 TO TAX THE VERY RICH.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 FOR TWO CENTS ON THE DOLLAR,
 WE COULD PAY FOR UNIVERSAL CHILD
 CARE, UNIVERSAL PRE-K, UNIVERSAL
 COLLEGE AND NOT BACK THE STUDENT
 LOAN DEBT BURDEN FOR ABOUT 43
 MILLION AMERICANS AND STILL HAVE
 NEARLY JUST SHORT OF $1 TRILLION
 LEFT OVER.
 THAT, OF COURSE, WILL BE
 PORTRAYED IF SHE BECOMES THE
 NOMINEE BY DONALD TRUMP AS SHE
 WANTS TO TAX YOU, SHE WANTS TO
 TAX YOU, NOT JUST THE WEALTHY,
 BUT ALL OF YOU.
 IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE
 POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE
 DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE
 DISPOSITIVE.
 THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE FOR SOME
 VERSIONS OF, OBVIOUSLY,
 EXPANDING HEALTH CARE AND
 HELPING WITH TUITION AND SO
 FORTH.
 I GUESS SANDERS STRIKES ME AS
 THE ONE WHO'S DISTINCT.
 I THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER
 OF -IT WILL BE SANDERS AND
 PROBABLY EVERYONE ELSE, I THINK.
 AND SANDERS SEEMS TO BE THE ONE
 CANDIDATE WHO'S GOT A REAL BASE.
 HE SEEMS TO BE STICKING RIGHT AT
 30% IN THE POLLS.
 FOR ME THE LESSON IN THAT NEW
 HAMPSHIRE POLL IS THAT THIS IS
 WILL PROBABLY STAY AT 30, BUT
 IT'S ALMOST AS LIKELY THAT
 SOMEONE WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF,
 BUTTIGIEG TWO MONTHS AGO, COULD
 EASILY BE THE MAIN CHALLENGER.
 NO JOE BIDEN, NOT ELIZABETH
 WARREN OR KAMALA HARRIS.
 OR IT COULD BE A THREE OR FOUR
 OR FIVE-WAY RACE WITH SOME OF
 THOSE OTHER CANDIDATES.
 MAYBE SETH MOULTON WILL TAKE
 OFF, AND WE'LL HAVE THE
 MOULTON/AND BUTTIGIEG YOUNG
 VETERANS IN THEIR 30s.
 ADD TULSI GABBARD TO THAT.
 AND AMY KLOBUCHAR WILL BE IN THE
 TOWN HALL THIS EVENING, THE
 SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA.
 HER ARGUMENT IS THAT SHE CAN WIN
 IN TRUMP COUNTRY.
 SHE HAS BEEN A VERY POPULAR VOTE
 GETTER IN MINNESOTA, WHICH
 ALMOST WENT FOR TRUMP, BUT SHE'S
 WON OVER TRUMP COUNTIES.
 TAKE A LISTEN TO HER MAKING THIS
 ARGUMENT.
 I'M FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE
 COUNTRY, I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE
 RACE THAT HAS REPEATEDLY WON
 TRUMP COUNTIES AND TRUMP
 DISTRICTS, TO THE POINT WHERE
 THREE TIMES IN A ROW, I HAVE WON
 EVERY SINGLE CONGRESSIONAL
 DISTRICT IN MY STATE, INCLUDING
 THE RURAL ONES.
 AND FOR DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO
 WIN, THAT COULD BE A COMPELLING
 ARGUMENT.
 AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S SAYING,
 ESSENTIALLY, I COULD BEAT TRUMP.
 THAT'S WHY SHE'S SAYING SHE
 COULD WIN THOSE COUNTIES.
 AND THAT'S WHAT THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN AND THE TRUMP WHITE
 HOUSE SEEMS TO BE MORE CONCERNED
 ABOUT.
 IF THEY COULD RUN AGAINST A
 BERNIE SANDERS, THAT IS
 ESSENTIALLY THEIR DREAM.
 THEY FEEL LIKE THAT'S A PRETTY
 EASY CAMPAIGN FOR THEM TO SET
 UP.
 THEY CAN DRAW A STARK CONTRAST
 BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND PEOPLE
 LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE
 SANDERS, BUT NOT SO MUCH WITH
 PEOPLE LIKE AMY KLOBUCHAR, WHO
 HAS BEEN THE ONE CANDIDATE WHO
 HAS NOT BEEN AFRAID TO SAY NO TO
 SOME OF THOSE POLICY PROPOSALS,
 LIKE MEDICARE FOR ALL AND THE
 GREEN NEW DEAL.
 SHE'S BEEN MUCH MORE MODERATE ON
 THOSE PROPOSALS.
 IS IT SOMEONE LIKE THAT THAT CAN
 BEAT THE PRESIDENT?
 IT DOESN'T SEEM OBVIOUSLY THAT
 THEY KNOW EITHER WAY.
 THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY COULD GO
 MORE EXTREME AND IMPEACH OR
 FOLLOW THE AMY KLOBUCHAR ROUTE
 AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS KIND
 OF BANKING ON THEM NOT FIGURING
 THAT OUT UNTIL THE END.
 SETH MOULTON IS TALKING ABOUT
 HOW HE DID FOUR TOURS IN IRAQ, A
 MARINE VETERAN.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIS CHANCES?
 HE'S NEW TODAY, SO I WANT TO
 GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHEW OVER
 HIM A LITTLE BIT.
 IS HE OFFERING SOMETHING THAT
 OTHER CANDIDATES ARE NOT?
 I THINK HE'S JUST SOMEONE WHO
 THINKS HE HAS NOTHING TO LOSE.
 THERE ARE SOME CANDIDATES WHO
 WANT TO EVALUATE THEIR PROFILE
 AND HE'S SOMEONE WHO CHALLENGED
 THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEFEAT A
 LONG-TERM INCUMBENT, IT SHOWS
 THAT REALLY ANYONE CAN TRY TO
 USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A
 NAME FOR THEMSELVES.
 AND YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS
 TONIGHT'S CNN MAJOR TOWN HALL
 EVENT LIFE IN MANCHESTER, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE.
 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR UP AT 7:00
 A.M. EASTERN, ELIZABETH WARREN
 AT 8:00, BERNIE SANDERS AT 9:00,
 KAMALA HARRIS A AT 10:00 AND
 PETE BUTTIGIEG AT 11:00 P.M.
 EASTERN.
 IN OUR EARTH MATTERS DAY,
 CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAVING AN
 EFFECT RIGHT NOW.
 BUT AS CNN'S BILL WEIR
 DISCOVERED, EVEN MANY OF THE
 THOSE AMERICANS BEING HURT RIGHT
 NOW DON'T BELIEVE THAT CLIMATE
 CHANGE IS REAL. Reporter: IN TH
 HEARTLAND, THEATá#e■F
 2019 SETTING THE WORST KIND
 CORDS.
 IT WAS A MONTH AGO WHEN HEAVY
 SNOW MELTED SO FAST AND A BOMB
 CYCLONE RAINED SO HARD, WATER
 OVERWHELMED THE ARMY CORPS OF
 ENGINEERS AND LEVEES IN SIX
 STATES.
 THE FLOODWATERS CAME WITH SUCH
 FORCE, THEY RIPPED OPEN GRAIN
 SILOS ACROSS THE MIDWEST,
 CONTAMINATING THE CROP WITH
 TOXIC WATER AND RUINING
 LIVELIHOOD OF SO MANY FARMERS
 WHO HAD BEEN STORING THEIR GRAIN
 IN ORDER TO SURVIVE THE TRADE
 WAR WITH CHINA.
 MOST AMERICAN PHAFARMS ARE NOT
 FULLY INSURED AGAINST THIS KIND
 OF DISASTER.
 AND IN HAMBURG, IOWA, 70% OF THE
 HOMES HAD NOLOOD INSURANCE AT
 ALL.
 MOLD IS SPREADING.
 THE BALL FIELD IS STILL A LAKE.
 AND DOWNTOWN IS A GHOST TOWN.E
 THIS DAY IS A VISITOR FROM THE
 WEST, HERE TO WARN THE NATION
 THAT THIS IS JUSTa  BEGI
 WE KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT
 WHAT WE SEE HERE TODAY IS JUST A
 PRECURSOR OF MANY, MANY MORE
 INTENSE FLOODS IN THE FUTURE,
 BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
 PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR JAY
 INSLEE.
 Reporter: THE WASHINGTON
 GOVERNOR IS THE FIRST PERSON IN
 HISTORY TO BUILD A PRESIDENTIAL
 CAMPAIGN AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE,
 A TOPIC DISCUSSED FOR ABOUT FIVE
 MINUTES IN THE LAST THREE
 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.
 YOU NEED, WHAT IS IT, 65,000
 INDIVIDUAL DONORS TO GET ON A
 STAGE AT THE DEBATE.
 YOU PET.
 HOW MANY YOU GOT NOW?
 WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO.
 IF YOU KEEP THIS TOPIC IN THE
 DEBATE, IN THE MINDS OF VOTERS,
 EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE POLLING LESS
 THAN 1%, IS THAT A VICTORY?
 OR FOR YOU, ARE YOU REALLY
 THINKING YOU HAVE A SHOT AT THE
 OVAL OFFICE?
 INTENT IS TOg■
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 THAT IOWA DEMOCRATS NOW LIST
 CLIMATE CHANGE NEXT TO HEALTH
 CARE AS A TOP CONCERN.
 AND AFTERASTERS LIKE THIS,
 YOU WOULD THINK EVEN SKEPTICAL
 REPUBLICANS MIGHT JOIN THEM.
 SO DO YOU HAVE WATER SERVICE
 HERE NOW?
 NO.
 WE HAVE NO WATER AND NO HEAT.
 Reporter: BUT RON PERRY DOWN
 AT THE RISKY BUSINESS AUTO SHOP
 IS NOT BUYING WHAT THE GOVERNOR
 IS SELLING.
 THE GOVERNOR IS HERE BECAUSE HE
 BELIEVES THAT ALL OF THIS DAMAGE
 THE DIRECT RESULT OF CLIMATE
 CHANGE.
 DO YOU SEE IT THAT WAY?
 NO!
 ABSOLUTELY NOT!
 I BLAME IT ON THE CORPS OF
 ENGINEERS, TOTALLY.
 YOU CAN'T EXPECT THE ARMY
 CORPS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF
 THE TRUMP -WHEN THE PRESIDENT
 OF THE UNITED STATES IS TELLING
 HIM TO IGNORE CLEAR SCIENCE.
 HOW DO YOU CONVINCE A GUY
 LIKE RON TO VOTE FOR YOU?
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE,
 NOT EVERY -I DON'T EXPECT
 EVERYONE TO VOTE FOR ME.
 JUST WELL OVER
 NO, I GET THAT!
 BUT, YOU USE THE MOONSHOT
 ANALOGY.
 WHEN KENNEDY SAID, WE'RE GOING
 TO THE MOON, REPUBLICANS DIDN'T
 ARGUE THAT THERE'S NO MOON.
 AND THIS IS A MILLION MOONSHOTS
 PUT TOGETHER.
 WELL, I TELL YOU, THE WAY YOU
 DO IT IS YOU DEFEAT DONALD
 TRUMP.
 DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TELLING
 FOLKS THIS IS A CHINESE HOAX.
 AND WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT
 IS SO WILLFULLY IGNORANT, THAT
 PERSON HAS TO BE REMOVED FROM
 PUBLIC LIFE.
 AND THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO.
 LOOK, WHAT WINS SUPPORT HERE IS
 A RECOGNITION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
 AND VITALITY.
 THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT JOBS AND
 WIND TURBINES AND SOLAR POWER
 AND ELECTRIC CARS AND BATTERIES.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN
 ARGUMENT ABOUT PARTS PER M
 OF CARBON IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF
 PEOPLE GOING TO.
 AND THAT'S MY MEAGE.
 Reporter: SINCE HIS STATE
 JUST REJECTED A TAX ON CARBON,
 THAT WOULD BE AN AMBITIOUS
 FUTURE.
 THIS IS THE GRIM PRESENT, A
 DYING , PLANTING SEASON IN
 PERIL, AND ANOTHER FLOOD WARNING
 IN THE FORECAST.
 BILL WEIR, CNN, HAMBURG, IOWA.
 AND OUR THANKS, AS ALWAYS, TO
 BILL WEIR FOR THAT REPORT.
 ANY MOMENT NOW, SPEAKER NANCY
 PELOSI IS GOING TO LEAD A
 CONFERENCE CALL WITH HOUSE
 DEMOCRATS TO DECIDE WLP
 IMPEACHMENT IS THE RIGHT WAY
 FORWARD FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY.
 STAY WITH US.
