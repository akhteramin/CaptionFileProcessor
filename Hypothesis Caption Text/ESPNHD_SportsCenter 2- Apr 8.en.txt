 HOW ABOUT THE PITCHERS?

 AVERAGE.
 THAT IS BETTER THAN ZERO.
 LET'S FIND A BRIGHT SPOT IN ALL
 OF THIS.
 HITTING THE BANK IN GREAT
 POSITION.
 HE HAS MADE A COUPLE OF MILLION
 AND THE O'S STILL OWE HIM $100
 MILLION UNTIL THE YEAR 2037.
 ZUBIN: DAVIS IS NOT BUMMED OUT

 AWFUL.

 IN ONE PITCH THIS SEASON AND  ß
 BETTER.

 MURPHY WITH SIX.
 TRYING TO GET THESE GUYS OFF THE
 MOUND.
 KENNY: WE SELECTED THE KINDEST
 PERSON WHO WORKS FOR ESPN TO BE
 INVOLVED IN THIS CHRIS DAVIS
 THING SO WE COULD HANDLE IT
 HUMANELY.
 I KNOW HE IS GETTING RIPPED ON
 SOCIAL MEDIA.
 WHAT IS GOING ON?
 IS THERE A COMBINATION OF THINGS
 THAT LED TO THIS HORRIBLE
 STREAK?
 TIM: YES, THE BIGGEST FACTOR IS
 THIS IS THE HARDEST GAME IN
 WORLD TO PLAY.
 A LOT OF PLAYERS HAVE SIMILAR
 STREAKS LIKE THIS.
 THIS JUST CAN'T HAPPEN IN OTHER
 SPORTS LIKE IT DOES IN BASEBALL.
 THIS IS AN NBA JUMP SH
 MISSING 20 IN A ROW.
 IN BASEBALL, GIVEN THE DEGREE OF
 DIFFICULTY, THIS CAN HAPPEN.
 THEN IT GETS IN YOUR HEAD.
 OH, MY GOD, I'M NEVER GOING TO
 GET ANOTHER HIT.
 IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY IN
 BASKETBALL.
 A GREAT SHOOTER MISSES 15 IN A
 ROW.
 HE CAN'T WAIT TO SHOOT 16
 BECAUSE HE KNOWS THIS IS GOING
 IN.
 CHRIS DAVIS HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS
 GOING ON NOW.
 EACH AT-BAT, EACH TIME HE
 DOESN'T GET A HIT MAKES IT
 WORSE.
 KENNY: ARE HIS TEAMMATES SAYING
 A LOT TO HIM OR LITTLE TO HIM?
 IF YOU KEEP TALKING, IT MAKES
 THE PROBLEM WORSE MAYBE BUT IF
 YOU DON'T GIVE HIM ADVICE, HE IS
 ON HIS OWN.
 TIM: ALL OF THIS INFORMATION THE
 HITTERS HAVE, IT IS NOT HELPING.
 IF YOU HEAR TOO MUCH INFORMATION
 IT PARALYZES YOU.
 IF SOMEBODY SPEAKS TO YOU
 BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT AN HIT
 SINCE SEPTEMBER 14, THAT IS NOT
 EASY EITHER.
 DEALING WITH A TEAMMATE GOING
 THROUGH THIS IS VERY, VERY HARD
 ALSO.
 KENNY: IF HE GETS A FEW HITS HE
 WILL BE LIKE ALL RIGHT.
 I'M BATTING .073.
 TREVOR ROSENTHAL OF THE NATS HAS
 NOT RECORDED AN OUT.
 TIM: HE IS THE FIRST PLAYER
 SINCE EARNED RUNS FOR MADE
 OFFICIAL OVER 100 YEARS TO GO TO
 MAKE FOUR APPEARANCES, HIS FIRST
 FOUR APPEARANCES OF THE SEASON
 AND NOT GET ANYBODY OUT.
 HEy@ HAS9■■x AN INFINITY E.R.A.
 AFTER FOUR APPEARANCES.
 HE HAS FACED NINE BATTERS AND
 RETIRED NONE OF THEM.
 THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN OVER
 100 YEARS.
 TO HAVE STREAKS LIKE THESE
 GOING, IF THESE TWO EVER FACED
 EACH OTHER, IT WOULD BE LIKE THE
 GREATEST THING I HAD EVER SEEN.
 I WOULD HAVE TO RETIRE AFTER IT
 BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET ANY
 BETTER THAN THIS.

   I know what you're thinking.
   Electric, it's not for you.
   And, you're probably right.
      Electric just doesn't      have enough range.
       It will never       survive the winter.
        Charging stations?
 Good luck finding one of those.
    So, maybe an electric car    isn't for you after all.
            Or, is it?

   No one knows what the future
        of transportation         will look like.

 TIGER WOODS IS NOW DRIVING.
 MY WHOLE GOAL IS TO BEAT YOU.
 KENNY: ONE TIME FOR ONE OF OUR
 PRETEND GOLF STORIES I ASKED
 TIGER WOODS IF HE WOULD GO ALONG
 WITH A PRETEND STORY ABOUT HOW
 MUCH HE LOVED IT WHEN PEOPLE
 TOOK PICTURES AND CAMERAS MADE
 SHUTTER NOISES IN HIS BACKSWING.
 HE SAID NO.
 HE PROBABLY STILL HATES SHUTTER
 NOISE IN HIS BACKSWING BUT HE
 WOULD ACCEPT IT IF HE HAD HIS
 OLD SWING BACK.
 HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE PLAYING
 IF THE MASTERS.
 IT IS UP NOW TO OUR GOLF TEAM AT
 AUGUSTA TO PAINT THE FULL
 PI
 GREETINGS FROM AUGUSTA
 NATIONAL.
 THIS FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK.
 83RD MASTERS COMING THURSDAY.
 SUN WAS OUT EARLY.
 WARM DAY.

 EAIGER WOODS. ■8 YEARS REMOVED FROM HIS LAST
 TRIUMPH HERE AND STUCK ON 14
 MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT THE
 FOUR-TIME MASTERS CHAMPION
 CAPTAIN VATES EVEN ON A MONDAY
 AS HE ENJOYED A PRACTICE ROUND
 WITH FRED COUPLES.
 AND JUSTIN THOMAS.
 EVEN THOUGH HE IS 14 YEARS
 REMOVED FROM HIS LAST WIN HERE,
 SO MUCH OF HOW WE VIEW THIS ZOR
 PARTICULAR THROUGH THE LENS OF
 TIGER WOODS, WHAT IS HE WORKING
 ON?
 WOODS IS AS MUCH A CREATURE
 OF HABIT AS ANYONE ON TOUR.
 ONE BREAK THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,
 OUT SHARP AT 8:00 A.M. OFF THE
 10 TEE ON MONDAY BEFORE THE
 HEAVIER WEATHER ROLLED IN
 GSIDE JUSTIN THOMAS r/D FREDN?=M
 WAY OVER TO THE PRACTICE AREA
 AND PUT IN AN HOUR PLUS THERE AS
 WELL.

 WITH THE WEATHER, WE'LL SEE HOW
 THAT AFFECTS THE PREPARATION
 GOING FORWARD.
 THANK YOU.
 ALONGSIDE MY FRIEND ANDY NORTH.
 AS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE
 WEDGES AND THE PUTTERS, YOU WERE
 NODDING YOUR HEAD.
 WHY?
 IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON A BOAT IN
 THE PACIFIC, YOU DON'T
 UNDERSTAND HOW POORLY TIGER'S
 I THOUGHT INY HE■b■ñ■■■■■■■LE
 E FACT THAT HE IS THROUGHOUT
 DOING SOME THINGS THAT HELP YOU
 WIN HERE, TO GET THE BALL UP AND
 IN TO, MAKE THAT 8-FOOTER FROM
 PAR, TO TWO-PUTT FROM 14, 15
 FEET AWAY.
 YOU CAN NEVER CAN PLAY THIS
 COURSE TOO MUCH.
 YOU CAN'T MASTER THIS
 PARTICULAR GOLF COURSE EVEN AS
 WELL AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT.
 TOM ALLUDED TO THE WEATHER.
 HE SAID IT WAS GREAT.
 IT WAS FAST.
 SINCE THEN, WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF
 THIS.
 WHERE DOES THAT LEIGH THINGS ON
 MONDAY?
 THE GOLF COURSE WAS SOFTER
 THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
 LIKED.
 THEY ARE TALKING AN INCH OR TWO
 OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
 IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT WILL BE A
 PROBLEM.
 WE HAVE THE SUBAIR SYSTEM HERE
 TO SUCK THE MOISTURE OUT OF THE
 GREENS BUT IT STILL IS NOT GOING
 TO GET THE FIRMNESS THEY HAD A
 COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
 EXPERIENCE HERE IS SO
 CRITICAL.
 THOSE WHO KNOW IT WELL KNOW COME
 THURSDAY MORNING NO MATTER WHAT
 THEY HAVE SEEN IT IS GOING TO
 LOOK DIFFERENT.
 I'M HAPPY TO SEE TWENDS WEATHER
 LOOKS FANTASTIC.
 MY FAVORITE DAY OF THE WEEK
 HERE.
 PAR 3 CONTEST.
 WE HAVE A PREVIEW SHOW HERE AS
 WELL.
 BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, A LOT OF
 HARD WORK WILL GO IN AS FOLKS
 TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE SLIP

 JOHNSON IS NOW DOWN TO SECOND IN
 THE WORLD GOLF RANKINGS.
 HE WAS SURPLANTED AT THE TOP BY
 THIS MAN, JUSTIN ROSE.
 HE HASN'T BEEN FITTED WITH A
  JACKET YET.
 IT WOULD NOT SHOCK ANYONE IF
 D.J. OR JUSTIN WERE TO BREAK
 THROUGH THIS YEAR AT THE
 MASTERS.

 ZUBIN: THERE IS A NOTION IN THE
 NBA THE LEAGUE LOVES TO AWARD
 THE SHINY NEW ENTITY WITH THE
 M.V.P. AWARD.
 AFTER ALL EVEN THOUGH MICHAEL
 JORDAN WON AN M.V.P. FIVE TIMES
 HE ONLY WITH WON IT BACK-TO-BACK
 ONCE.
 JAMES HARDEN MIGHT DESERVE IT
 AGAIN BUT GIANNIS MIGHT GET IT
 AGAIN.
 HARDEN!
 JAMES HARDEN!
 I DON'T THINK THERE IS ONE
 GUY THAT CAN STOP HIM.

 ZUBIN: --
 HARDEN OR GIANNIS.
 WHO TAKES HOME THE HARDWARE?
 I AM GOING TO MAKE THE KICE WHY
 IT SHOULD BE ANTETOKOUNMPO.
 THE HARDEN SHOW.
 HARDEN■O 36 A GAME WITH A 30

 YOU KNOW WHO NEVER DID THAT?

 HOW MANY M.V.P. AWARDS DID HE
 GET?
 NONE.
 OBVIOUSLY THOSE NUMBERS DON'T
 MEAN ANYTHING.
 SHOWTIME.
 ANTETOKOUNMPO WITH THE HAMMER.
 HERE IS THE REASON AMONG THEN
 MANY I THINK GIANNIS IS GOING TO
 WIN.
 FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT SEASON HE
 IS LEADING THE BUCKS IN POINTS,v
