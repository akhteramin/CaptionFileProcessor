 ACTRESS, HELEN MIRREN.
 YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, I SWEAR TO GOD, JASON AND I CAN'T
 COORDINATE OUR OUTFITS TONIGHT.
 THIS IS PURELY ACCIDENTAL.
 BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW, THESE

 MATURE ENGLISH WOMAN CAN BOTH
 WEAR PINK.
 FINALLY.
 THE TIMES ARE CHANGING.
 YES.
 BOOM.
 DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKERS BRING US
 STORIES OF REAL PEOPLE, DOING
 REAL THINGS, AND IN DOING SO,
 THEY CAN OFTEN OPEN OUR EYES TO

 THEY ARE INSIGHTFUL AND
 ILLUMINATING, SOMETIMES
 ASTONISHING, AND ALWAYS
 AUTHENTIC.
 AND REVELATORY.

 WANT TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR
 HIM.

 I'M MAKING THIS FILM BECAUSE
 I WAS PHYSICALLY DISCIPLINED BY

 SENSE TO ME.
 AND I SAW MYSELF IN YOUR OWN
 STORY.
 "OF FATHERS AND SONS."
 [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] "RBG."

          I go to a lot  of different music festivals,
        a lot of different            concerts,
           and when I'm      in these large crowds,
     even when I'm with tens     of thousands of people,
      and I just love being     the friend with service.
         It's really cool   to be able to take a photo,
          take a video,  be immediately able to post it
       on my social media.
        Because I am tall,
         I get that good    kind of view of the stage.
             Amazing.

 MOVIES, LIKE MUSIC, CAN DO
 MORE THAN ENTERTAIN.
 A GREAT MOVIE CAN BECOME A PART
 OF THE CONVERSATION OF HISTORY.
 AND, LIKE OUR NEXT MOVIE, AND
 THE KIND OF SONGS I LIKE TO
 MAKE, IT CAN DO IT WITH
 FEEDBACK, NOISE, AND, YES,
 ANGER.
 ADAM McKAY'S "VICE" IS SUCH A
 FILM.
 SHREDDING THE TRADITIONAL
 BIOPIC STRUCTURE WITH PASSION
 AND HUMOR, "VICE" SEEKS TO PUT A
 SPOTLIGHT ON A MAN WHO AVOIDED
 IT HIS WHOLE CAREER --
 DICK CHENEY.
 BRILLIANTLY ACTED, THE FILM IS A
 LESSON ABOUT THE PAST THAT
 SERVES AS A WARNING ABOUT THE
 PRESENT AND THE FUTURE.
 WAR, GREED, TRUTH, LIES,
 FATHERHOOD, LOVE, TORTURE, AND
 BETRAYAL ALL SWIRL AROUND IN
 "VICE" WITH A HARD BACKBEAT AND
 A KILLER BASSLINE.
 SOME WILL DIG IT.
 SOME WILL COVER THEIR EARS.
 BUT EVERYONE WILL DO THE ONE
 THING THE MOVIE BEGS US TO DO,
 REACT.
 THIS IS "VICE."
 SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?
 THE PLAN IS TO TAKE OVER THE
 DAMN PLACE.
 GEORGE, YOU MAKE DECISIONS
 BASED ON INSTINCT.
 NO ONE HAS SHOWN THE WORLD
 THE TRUE POWER OF THE AMERICAN
 PRESIDENCY.
 THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THE VICE
 PRESIDENT REALLY DOES.
 IT IS NOW.
 YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IF
 YOU HAVE POWER, PEOPLE WILL
 ALWAYS TRY TO TAKE IT FROM YOU.

 PLEASE WELCOME OSCAR-NOMINATED ACTRESS QUEEN
 LATIFAH.
 IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TO
 INTRODUCE ONE OF TONIGHT'S
 NOMINEES FOR BEST PICTURE, "THE
 FAVOURITE."
 THE FILM TAKES US TO
 18th CENTURY BRITAIN WITH A
 MONARCH LACKING THE INTEREST,
 AND MAYBE THE ABILITY, TO LEAD.
 DECISION MAKING IS TAKEN OVER BY
 AN INNER CIRCLE.
 THERE IS INFIGHTING FOR THE
 RULER'S AFFECTION.
 AS THE STAKES GET HIGHER, WE SEE
 CORRUPTION LEAD TO THE DOWNFALL
 OF ONE UNDERLING AFTER ANOTHER.
 IT'S NOT EASY BEING QUEEN.
 THIS IS "THE FAVOURITE."
 I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T FOUND YOUR
 TIME WITH THE QUEEN TOO TEDIOUS.
 YES, I'M BEAUTIFUL.
 IF I WERE A MAN, I WOULD RAVISH
 YOU.
 YOU'RE JEALOUS.
 SHE'S A VIPER.
 I'M ON MY SIDE, ALWAYS.
 STOP IT.

 "BLACK PANTHER" MAY BE AN

 I KNOW THIS PERSONALLY, BECAUSE
 OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CONSTANTLY
 COME UP TO ME AND SAY,
 "WAKANDA FOREVER."
 EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
 MY AFRICAN FRIENDS ARE LIKE,
 "WANKANDA FOREVER."
 IN FRANCE, PEOPLE SAY, "HELLO,
 TREVOR NOAH, HOW YOU SAY,
 WAKANDA FOREVER?"
 EVEN BACKSTAGE, MEL GIBSON CAME
 UP TO ME, LIKE, "WAKANDA
 FOREVER."
 HE SAID ANOTHER WORD TO ME AFTER
 THAT, BUT THE WAKANDA PART WAS
 NICE.
 GROWING UP AS A YOUNG BOY IN
 WAKANDA, I WOULD SEE KING
 T'CHALLA FLYING OVER OUR VILLAGE
 AND HE WOULD REMIND ME OF A
 GREAT XHOSA PHRASE.

   I'm connected with my boys.
         Every day I can      video chat with them.
     I could be in the middle           of Wyoming,
    even if I'm like waaay...            out here,
    I can still reach my kids.     Baby, you-you see me?

          You have brie?
    I've talked on this phone
    through the happiest times           of my life,
     and through the saddest        times of my life.
       But I never dreamed       in a thousand years
   that it would save my life.
              Boom!
         I fell 22 feet, completely shattered my pelvis,
   in the middle of the woods.
        I called my wife,    she thought I was jokin'.
     I said, "Man, I'm not...            I'm not."
    I was so lucky that day...          saved my life.
          There for you      when it matters most.

 ACADEMY AWARD WINNER, BARBRA
 STREISAND.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 THANK YOU.


 WHEN I FIRST SAW
 "BLACKKKLANSMAN," I WAS STUNNED
 AND WAS VERY EXCITED, AND WAS
 VERY MOVED.
 IT HAD EVERYTHING A GREAT FILM
 SHOULD HAVE.
 IT WAS SO REAL, SO FUNNY, AND
 YET SO HORRIFYING, BECAUSE IT
 WAS BASED ON THE TRUTH.
 AND TRUTH IS ESPECIALLY PRECIOUS
 THESE DAYS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I HAD TO -THANK YOU.
 SO, I HAD TO TWEET ABOUT IT, YOU
 KNOW, ABOUT HOW GOOD IT WAS.
 AND THEN I GOT A LOVELY THANK
 YOU FROM SPIKE HIMSELF.
 THE CONVERSATION AFTER THAT WAS
 VERY EASY, BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH
 RAISED IN BROOKLYN.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 AND, SPIKE, WE BOTH LOVE HATS.
 SO, AFTER A LIFETIME OF BOLD,
 GAMECHANGING WORK, HERE IS
 SPIKE LEE'S MASTERPIECE, THE
 STORY OF THE FIRST
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN DETECTIVE IN
 THE COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE
 DEPARTMENT WHO JOINS FORCES WITH
 HIS JEWISH COLLEAGUE TO
 INFILTRATE THE KU KLUX KLAN.
 NOW, THAT IS FUNNY ALREADY.
 BUT IT'S AN UNFLINCHING LOOK AT
 RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA BACK
 IN THE 1970s.
 THAT WAS THEN, BUT IT'S JUST AS
 RELEVANT TODAY.
 THIS IS RON STALLWORTH.
 I'M ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU.
 I'M JUST HAPPY TO MEET A TRUE
 WHITE AMERICAN.
 THEY WANT TO MEET ME FIRST.
 YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T GO TO
 THAT MEETING.
 YOU NEED TO WAKE UP.
 DON'T THINK THAT I DON'T CARE
 ABOUT MY PEOPLE!

 BLACK POWER!
 WHITE POWER!
 YOU'RE JEWISH, BROTHER.
 WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE YOU
 DON'T HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME?
 THAT'S MY BUSINESS.
 IT'S OUR BUSINESS.

 PLEASE WELCOME LAST YEAR'S
 WINNERS FOR ACTRESS IN A
 SUPPORTING ROLE AND ACTOR IN A
 LEADING ROLE, ALLISON JANNEY AND
 GARY OLDMAN.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

 YOU KNOW, YOU AND I COULDN'T
 HAVE WON OSCARS FOR PORTRAYING
 TWO MORE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
 THAT'S SO TRUE.
 ONE OF US PLAYING A BRASH AND
 CONTROVERSIAL LEADER, KNOWN FOR
 LOVING WHISKY AND ALWAYS BEING
 ENSHROUDED IN THAT TRADEMARK
 CLOUD OF SMOKE.
 YES.
 AND THEN, OF COURSE, YOU PLAYED
 CHURCHILL.
 YES.
 AND HERE ARE THE NOMINEES FOR
 PERFORMANCE BY AN ACTOR IN A
 LEADING ROLE.
 CHRISTIAN BALE, "VICE."
 3,000 INNOCENT PEOPLE BURNED
 TO DEATH BY THOSE MONSTERS.
 AND YET YOU OBJECT WHEN I REFUSE
 TO KISS THOSE MONSTERS ON THE
 CHEEK AND SAY PRETTY PLEASE.
 YOU ANSWER ME THIS.
 WHAT TERRORIST ATTACK WOULD YOU
 HAVE LET GO FORWARD SO YOU
 WOULDN'T SEEM LIKE A MEAN AND
 NASTY FELLA?
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 BRADLEY COOPER, "A STAR IS
 BORN."
 CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET?
 I THINK YOU MIGHT BE A
 SONGWRITER.
 DON'T WORRY, I WON'T TELL
 ANYBODY.
 BUT I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT KEEPING
 SECRETS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WILLEM DAFOE, "AT ETERNITY'S
 GATE."
 I BELIEVE I HAVE A MENACING
 SPIRIT AROUND ME.
 AN INVISIBLE BEING.
 I FEEL IT, I DON'T SEE IT.
 HE SPEAKS TO ME, AND THREATENS
 ME, AND ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS
 PLUNGE A KNIFE INTO MY HEART.
 I SAW HIM, AND I TRIED TO CUT
 HIM OUT OF MYSELF.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 RAMI MALEK, "BOHEMIAN
 RHAPSODY."

 ♪ COME ON I DON'T WANT TO DIE
 SOMETIMES WISH I NEVER HAD BEEN
 BORN AT ALL ♪
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 VIGGO MORTENSEN, "GREEN
 BOOK."
 YOU SPEAK GERMAN, HUH?
 THAT WAS RUSSIAN.
 I WAS STATIONED IN GERMANY,
 IN THE ARMY.
 I COULD PICK UP A LITTLE BIT OF
 WHAT YOU SAID.
 WATCH OUT FOR THEM KRAUTS,
 THEY'RE ALL SNEAKS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 AND THE OSCAR GOES TO RAMI
 MALEK!
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 THIS IS THE FIRST OSCAR AND
 NOMINATION FOR RAMI MALEK.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 OH, MY GOD. MY MOM IS IN HERE SOMEWHERE.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 OH, I LOVE YOU.
 I LOVE YOU, LADY.
 MY FAMILY, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF
 THIS.
 YOU KNOW, MY DAD DIDN'T GET TO
 SEE ME DO ANY OF THIS.
 BUT I THINK HE'S LOOKING DOWN ON
 ME RIGHT NOW.
 SO, THIS IS A MONUMENTAL MOMENT.
 ONE I'M SO APPRECIATIVE OF ALL
 OF YOU, TO EVERYONE WHO HAS HAD
 A HAND IN GETTING ME HERE.
 TO THE ACADEMY, TO PEOPLE WHO
 TOOK A CHANCE ON ME.
 EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
 GRAHAM KING.
 DENNIS O'SULLIVAN, EVERYONE AT
 FOX.
 AND NEW REGENCY.
 I KNOW I WASN'T THE OBVIOUS
 CHOICE, BUT I GUESS IT WORKED
 OUT.
 THANK YOU, QUEEN.
 THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING, FOR
 ALLOWING ME TO BE THE TINIEST
 PART OF YOUR PHENOMENAL,
 EXTRAORDINARY LEGACY.
 I AM FOREVER IN YOUR DEBT.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 MY CREW, AND MY CAST.
 I LOVE YOU.
 YOU ARE MY EQUALS, MY BETTERS.
 I COULD HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE
 WITHOUT YOU.
 I THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD HAVE
 BEEN LIKE TO TELL LITTLE BUBBA
 RAMI THAT ONE DAY THIS MIGHT
 HAPPEN TO HIM.
 AND I THINK HIS CURLY-HAIRED
 LITTLE MIND WOULD BE BLOWN.
 HE WAS STRUGGLING WITH HIS
 IDENTITY, TRYING TO FIGURE
 HIMSELF OUT.
 AND I THINK TO ANYONE STRUGGLING
 WITH THEIRS, AND TRYING TO
 DISCOVER THEIR VOICE, LISTEN, WE
 MADE A FILM ABOUT A GAY MAN, AN
 IMMIGRANT, WHO LIVED HIS LIFE
 JUST UNAPOLOGETICALLY HIMSELF.
 THE FACT THAT I'M CELEBRATING
 HIM AND THIS STORY WITH YOU
 TONIGHT IS PROOF THAT WE'RE
 LONGING FOR STORIES LIKE THIS.
 I AM THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS FROM
 EGYPT, A FIRST-GENERATION
 AMERICAN.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 AND PART OF MY STORY IS BEING
 WRITTEN RIGHT NOW.
 AND I COULD NOT BE MORE GRATEFUL
 TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU,
 AND EVERYONE WHO BELIEVED IN ME
 FOR THIS MOMENT.
 IT'S SOMETHING I WILL TREASURE
 FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
 LUCY, YOU'RE THE HEART OF THIS
 FILM.
 YOU ARE BEYOND IMMENSELY
 TALENTED.
 YOU HAVE CAPTURED MY HEART.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

   "If we want to play against        men, we're nuts."
    "And if we dream of equal    opportunity, delusional."
  "When we stand for something,         we're unhinged."
   "When we're too good there's    something wrong with us."
     "And if we get angry...
   we're hysterical, irrational      or just being crazy."
     "But, a women running a       marathon is crazy."
           [ANNOUNCER]   "Officials tried to pull her         off the course"
   "A woman boxing was crazy."
    "A woman dunking, crazy."
  "Coaching an NBA team, crazy."
 "A woman competing in a hijab."
      "Changing her sport."
  "Landing a double cork 1080."
   "Or winning 23 grand slams,
  having a baby and then coming          back for more.
    Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy           and crazy."
              [SFX]          Crowd cheering
     "So if they want to call         you crazy, fine.
  Show them what crazy can do."
        [Background music]
 It's only crazy until you do it.
        [Background music]           Just do it.
        [Background music]
     Today, faster than ever,     the world is changing,
  because opportunity is raging.
      Mixed Reality changing      the world we see,
  intelligence to build it like  we'd always hoped it would be.
    But it's not really about    what technology can do,
 it's about how it's used by you.
       In the end, its just       a tool so bring it,
     what's a hammer without     a person to swing it.
   Your possibility is endless,   your limits are few.
  So, here's the real question,
        What will you do?
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME AMANDLA STENBERG AND
 CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS.

 OUR FINAL NOMINEE FOR BEST PICTURE IS A FILM ABOUT BIGOTRY,
 FRIENDSHIP, AND GROWTH, BASED ON
 THE STORY OF A WHITE MAN AND AN
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN ON A
 JOURNEY THROUGH THE SEGREGATED
 SOUTH.
 I CAN BEAR WITNESS THAT THE
 PORTRAIT PAINTED OF THAT TIME
 AND PLACE IN OUR HISTORY IS VERY
 REAL.
 IT'S SEARED IN MY MEMORY, BLACK
 MEN AND WOMEN, OUR BROTHERS AND
 SISTERS, TREATED AS SECOND CLASS
 CITIZENS, THREATENED FOR RAISING
 THEIR FAMILIES OR EARNING A
 LIVING, BEATEN AND SOMETIMES
 KILLED FOR THE CRIME OF TRYING
 TO LIVE A LIFE WITH DIGNITY.
 OUR NATION BEARS THE SCARS OF
 THAT TIME, AS DO I.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THE CHARACTERS IN "GREEN
 BOOK" GRADUALLY TORE DOWN THE
 WALLS BETWEEN THEM, TRANSFORMING
 EACH OTHER IN THE PROCESS.
 AS THIS FILM DEMONSTRATES, ANY
 JOURNEY THAT OPENS SOMEONE'S
 EYES AND SOFTENS THEIR HEART IS
 ONE THAT IS WORTH TAKING.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 YOUNG OR OLD, I ENCOURAGE YOU
 TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN
 THE JOURNEY.
 THIS IS "GREEN BOOK."

 HAVE YOU EVER DRIVEN
 PROFESSIONALLY BEFORE?

 HAVE?
