 ALL RIGHT. WELCOME BACK TO MANCHESTER, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE.
 THIS IS CNN'S SPECIAL DEMOCRATIC
 TOWN HALL EVENT.
 I'M CHRIS CUOMO.
 THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING
 NIGHT.
 AS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN WE'RE
 DOING TOWN HALLS WITH FIVE OF
 THE TOPOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES.
 THE POTENTIAL QUEHH
 INCLUDE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND
 YOUNG ADULTS REPRESENTING MORE
 THAN 30 STATES NATIONWIDE.
 TO DO THIS CNN PARTNERED WITH
 HARVARD UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE
 OF POLITICS AND THE NEW
 HAMPSHIRE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS.
 ALREADY TONIGHT WE HEARD FROM
 SENATORS AMY KLOBACHAR AND
 ELIZABETH WARREN AND RIGHT NOW
 IS SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS OF
 VERMONT LEADING THE FIELD AMONG
 THE HARVARD INSTITUTE OF
 POLITICS.
 PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR SANDERS.
 HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 YOU TOO.
 THANK YOU.
 ALL RIGHT.
 HOW ABOUT OUR FIRST QUESTION.
 WHY NOT?
 WHY NOT, INDEED.
 WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE TO DO?
 WE'LL TALK LATER.
 HE'S FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND A
 JUNIOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
 MASSACHUSETTS, LOWELL.
 WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
 HI, SENATOR.
 HI.
 HOW ARE YOU?
 GOOD.
 YOU REDUCED YOUR MEDICARE FOR
 ALL LEGISLATION PACKAGE, MANY OF
 THEM ARE RUNNING ALONG SIDE OF
 YOU FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES.
 IN THIS LEGISLATION YOU CALLED
 FOR AN END TO PRIVATE HEALTH
 INSURANCE COMPANIES.
 HOW DO YOU PLAN TO PHASE OUT
 THESE COMPANIES FOR YOUR NEW
 MEDICARE FOR ALL INSURANCE.
 EXCELLENT QUESTION ON A ISSUE
 THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STAY
 UP NIGHTS ABOUT.
 WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL HEALTH
 CARE SYSTEM IN WHICH 30 MILLION
 AMERICANS HAVE NO HEALTH
 INSURANCE AT ALL.
 EVEN MORE ARE UNDERINSURED WITH
 HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND
 CO-PAYMENTS.
 WE BABPAY BY FAR THE HIGHEST PRS
 IN THE WORLD.
 IN TERMS OF INFANT MORTALITY AND
 LIFE EXPECTANCY NOT MAPARTICULAY
 GOOD.
 AND FOR ALL OF THAT WE SPEND
 TWICE AS MUCH PER CAPITA AS ANY
 COUNTRY ON EARTH.
 THE FUNCTION OF THE CURRENT
 HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS NOT TO
 PROVIDE QUALITY CARE FOR ALL IN
 A COST EFFECTIVE WAY.
 THE FUNCTION OF THE CURRENT
 SYSTEM IS TO MAKE BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS IN PROFITS FOR THE
 INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG
 COMPANIES.
 THAT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE
 CURRENT SYSTEM AND WHAT I
 BELIEVE IS THAT OVER FOUR YEAR
 OD■ IS WHAT MY
 LEGISLATION IS ABOUT, WE'RE
 GOING TO TRANSFORM OUR HEALTH
 CARE SYSTEM.
 SO FIRST YEAR WE GO FROM 65
 YEARS OF AGE TO ELIGIBILITY TO
 MEDICARE DOWN TO 55 AND WE COVER
 ALL OF THE KIDS IN THE COUNTRY
 AND BY THE WAY, DESPITE WHAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS WE EXPAND
 BENEFITS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS.
 MEDICARE IS A VERY GOOD PROGRAM
 BUT IT DOESN'T COVER DENTAL
 CARE.
 IT DOESN'T COVER EYEGLASSES AND
 IT DOESN'T COVER HEARING AIDS
 AND WE DO THAT.
 BOTTOM LINE IS I BELIEVE FROM
 THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THAT
 HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND
 NOT A PRIVILEGE AND THE BEST WAY
 TO GO FORWARD IN MY VIEW IS
 THROUGH MEDICARE FOR ALL SINGLE
 PAYER PROGRAM.
 NEXT QUESTION, ANN, JUNIOR AT
 HARVARD.
 SENATOR SANDERS, YOU SAID
 THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE
 WITH FELONY RECORDS SHOULD BE
 ALLOWED TO VOTE WHILE IN PRISON.
 DOES THIS MEAN YOU WOULD SUPPORT
 INFRANCHISING PEOPLE LIKE THE
 BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER, A
 CONVICTED TERRORIST AND MURDER?
 DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE
 CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
 SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
 VOTE FOR POLITICIANS THAT COULD
 HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON WOMEN'S
 RIGHTS?
 THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.
 WHAT OUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT IS
 CREATING A VIBRANT DEMOCRACY.
 TODAY AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE ONE OF
 THE LOWEST VOTER TURN OUTS OF MY
 COUNTRY ON EARTH.
 I WANT TO SEE ONE OF THE HIGHEST
 VOTER TURN OUTS.
 WE'RE SEEING MORE YOUNG PEOPLE
 GETTING INVOLVED IN THE
 POLITICAL PROCESS BUT NOT
 ENOUGH.
 AND IN MY VIEW IF YOUNG PEOPLE
 VOTED AT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
 THAT OLDER PEOPLE VOTED IN THIS
 COUNTRY WE WOULD TRANSFORM THIS
 NATION.
 BUT TO GET TO YOUR POINT, WE
 LIVE IN A MOMENT WHERE COWARDLY
 REPUBLICAN VOTE GOVERNORS ARE
 TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE.
 RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
 THEY'RE WORKING HARD TO MAKE IT
 MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
 TO VOTE AND TO ME THAT IS
 INCREDIBLY UNDEMOCRATIC,
 UN-AMERICAN PROCESS AND I SAY TO
 THOSE PEOPLE, BY THE WAY, IF YOU
 DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO
 PARTICIPATE IN FREE AND FAIR
 ELECTIONS YOU SHOULD GET ANOTHER
 JOB AND GET OUT OF POLITICS.
 ALL RIGHT?
 SO.
 SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
 AS IT HAPPENS IN MY OWN STATE OF
 VERMONT FROM THE VERY FIRST DAYS
 OF OUR STATE'S HISTORY OUR
 CONSTITUTION SAYS EVERYBODY CAN
 VOTE.
 SO PEOPLE IN JAIL CAN VOTE.
 IF SOMEBODY COMMITS A SERIOUS
 CRIME, SEXUAL ASSAULT, MURDER,
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUNISHED.
 THEY MAY BE IN JAIL FOR 10
 YEARS, 20 YEARS, 50 YEARS, THEIR
 WHOLE LIFE.
 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
 COMMIT A SERIOUS CRIME BUT I
 THINK THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS
 INHERENT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
 YES, EVEN FOR TERRIBLE PEOPLE
 BECAUSE ONCE YOU START CHIPPING
 AWAY AND YOU SAY WELL THAT GUY
 COMMITTED A TERRIBLE CRIME, NOT
 GOING TO LET HIM VOTE.
 WELL THAT PERSON DID THAT.
 NOT GOING TO LET THAT PERSON
 VOTE, YOU'RE RUNNING DOWN A
 SLIPPERY SLOPE.
 SO I BELIEVE PEOPLE COMMIT
 CRIMES AND THEY PAID THE PRICE
 AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
 I BELIEVE EVEN IF THEY'RE IN
 JAIL THEY'RE PAYING THEIR PRICE
 TO SOCIETY BUT THAT SHOULD NOT
 TAKE AWAY THEIR AMERICAN RIGHT
 TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY.
 YOU THINK THE BOSTON MARATHON
 BOMBER SHOULD VOTE NOT AFTER HE
 PAYS HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY BUT
 WHILE HE'S IN JAIL.
 ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
 I THINK I HAVE WRITTEN MANY
 30 SECOND OPPOSITION ADS
 THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.
 THIS WILL BE JUST ANOTHER ONE.
 BUT I DO BELIEVE -THIS IS WHAT
 I BELIEVE.
 YOU BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY?
 THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN 18
 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER WHO IS AN
 AMERICAN CITIZEN HAS THE RIGHT
 TO VOTE?
 ONCE YOU START CHIPPING AWAY AT
 THAT -THAT'S WHAT OUR
 REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE DOING.
 COMING UP WITH ALL KINDS OF
 EXCUSES WHILE PEOPLE OF COLOR,
 YOUNG PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE CAN'T
 VOTE AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I
 CAN TO RESIST IT.
 THIS IS A DEMOCRACY THIS IS A
 DEMOCRACY AND WE HAVE TO EXPAND
 THAT DEMOCRACY AND EVERY PERSON
 HAS A RIGHT TO VOTE.
 SHE IS A GRADUATE STUDENT
 STUDYING JOURNALISM.
 SHE'S HERE FROM GEORGIA.
 YOUR VIEWS ON REPARATIONS
 SURPRISED ME ESPECIALLY SINCE
 ONE OF THE MESSAGES OF YOUR
 CAMPAIGN IS CLOSING THE WEALTH
 GAP.
 FOR BLACK PEOPLE IT STEMS FROM
 THE AFTERMATH OF SLAVERY.
 IF IT'S NOT PART OF YOUR PLAN TO
 END THE WEALTH GAP FOR BLACK
 PEOPLE, WHAT IS?
 WHAT I HAVE SAID IS THERE IS
 LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE.
 AND I HAVE SAID IF THE HOUSE AND
 THE SENATE PASS IT I WILL SIGN
 IT AND THAT WILL CALL FOR A
 STUDY OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF
 REPARATIONS AND I THINK WHAT
 KENYA IS SAYING IS WHAT WE ALL
 KNOW TO BE TRUE.
 TODAY IN AMERICA IN THE MIDST OF
 MASSIVE INCOME DISPARITY WE HAVE
 ANOTHER DISPARITY BETWEEN BLACK
 AND WHITE.
 AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE
 ONE TENTH THE WEALTH THAT WHITE
 FAMILIES HAVE AND THAT IS
 UNACCEPTABLE AND WE HAVE TO DEAL
 WITH IT.
 NOW THE WAY I THINK WE CAN MOST
 EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH THAT AND
 THIS IS AN IDEA -I DIDN'T COME
 UP WITH IT.
 A CONGRESSMAN FROM SOUTH
 CAROLINA, HE CALLED IT THE
 10-20-30 LEGISLATION WHICH MEANS
 THAT YOU USE 10% OF FEDERAL
 FUNDS.
 THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY TO FOCUS
 ON COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE
 COUNTRY, MINORITY KMCOMMUNITIES
 WHO HAVE LONG-TERM POVERTY AND
 WE FOCUS ON THOSE COMMUNITIES.
 WE MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE
 KIDS GET THE EDUCATION THAT THEY
 NEED.
 THEY GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT
 THEY NEED.
 WE IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
 WE IMPROVE BROADBAND.
 WE CREATE A SITUATION IN THESE
 DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES WHERE WE
 TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY ALL
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
 THAT'S THE DIRECTION I THINK WE
 SHOULD GO.
 NEXT QUESTION.
 JORDAN COOK, SOPHOMORE STUDYING
 POLITICS AND HISTORY HERE.
 HE IS FROM MAINE.
 JORDAN, WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION.
 HELLO SENATOR SANDERS.
 WE LIVE IN THE AGE OF
 GLOBALIZATION.
 INTERNATIONAL TRADE HAS BECOME
 INCREASINGLY NECESSARY FOR A
 NATION TO REMAIN PROSPEROUS.
 TRUMP IN RECENT YEARS LIMITED R
 IN AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
 WHICH HAS GIVEN THE RUSSIANS AND
 CHINESE A CHANCE TO INFLUENCE
 SUCH REGIONS.
 WHAT WILL YOUR TRADE POLICY BE
 IN SUCH REGIONS COMPARED TO
 TRUMP?
 GOOD QUESTION.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
 WE LIVE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY.
 I THINK ALL OF US UNDERSTAND THE
 IMPORTANCE OF TRADE, BUT I
 HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN FAIR TRADE.
 NOT FREE TRADE.
 BECAUSE IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR
 QUESTION, YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE
 THAT DISASTROUS TRADE AGREEMENTS
 LIKE NAFTA, PERM NANENT NORMAL
 TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND
 OTHERS RESULTED IN MILLIONS OF
 AMERICANS, HARD WORKING PEOPLE
 WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE
 PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS IN THIS
 COUNTRY SHUTDOWN BECAUSE THEY
 WEREN'T MAKING ENOUGH MONEY AND
 THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD MAKE
 MORE MONEY GOING ABROAD PAYING
 PEOPLE $1 AN HOUR OR $2 AN HOUR.
 SO I BELIEVE IN TRADE BUT IT HAS
 TO BE A TRADE POLICY THAT WORKS
 FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND NOT JUST
 THE CEOs OF LARGE CORPORATIONS
 AND YOUR POINT IS ALSO RIGHT.
 WE'RE SEEING CHINA MOVE
 AGGRESSIVELY IN LATIN AMERICA
 AND AFRICA AND ASIA AND THIS IS
 AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS
 WELL.
 BUT BOTTOM LINE IS TRADE IS A
 GOOD THING BUT THERE'S A REASON
 WHY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE
 SEEN A DECLINE IN THEIR STANDARD
 OF LIVING.
 THEY ONCE HAD DECENT PAYING
 JOBS.
 THOSE JOBS WERE SHIFTED ABROAD
 AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I
 DISAGREE WITH STRONGLY.
 SENATOR SANDERS, YOU RECENTLY
 RELEASED 10 YEARS OF YOUR TAX
 RETURNS.
 I DID.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT TOPIC.
 ELLEN IS A FRESHMAN AT HARVARD
 AND GREW UP IN MASSACHUSETTS.
 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION FOR THE
 SENATOR.
 SENATOR SANDERS, THANK YOU
 FOR BEING HERE.
 YOUR TAX RETURNS RECENTLY
 REVEALED THAT YOU ARE, IN FACT,
 A MILLIONAIRE.
 HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO
 CONCERNS THAT YOUR FINANCIAL
 STATUS UNDERMINES YOUR AUTHORITY
 AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RAILED
 AGAINST MILLIONAIRES AND
 BILLIONAIRES?
 THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
 AND HERE IT IS.
 ALL RIGHT.
 YOU READY TO HAVE ME PLEAD
 GUILTY.
 I PLEAD GUILTY TO HAVE WRITTEN A
 BOOK WHICH WAS AN INTERNATIONAL
 BEST SELLER.
 OKAY?
 AND WHEN YOU WRITE A BOOK THAT
 MAKES IT TO THE TOP OF THE NEW
 YORK TIMES BEST SELLER LIST, YOU
 MAKE MONEY.
 AND I MADE MONEY.
 I SUSPECT THAT IN A COUPLE OF
 YEARS MY SALARY WILL GO BACK TO
 173,000 WHICH IS WHAT A MEMBER
 OF CONGRESS GETS.
 BUT I THINK YOUR QUESTION SHOULD
 ASK, WELL, NOW THAT YOU WROTE A
 BOOK AND YOU MADE MONEY, IS THAT
 GOING TO MEAN THAT YOU CHANGE
 YOUR POLICIES?
 WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY
 WHO NOT ONLY VOTED AGAINST
 TRUMP'S DISASTROUS TAX PLAN, 83%
 OF THE BENEFITS GOING TO THE TOP

 BUT I HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE IN
 THIS CAMPAIGN TO FIGHT FOR
 PROGRESSIVE TAXATION.
 IN OTHER WORDS, WHETHER IT'S
 BERNIE SANDERS OR YOUR FAMILY OR
 ANYBODY ELSE IN AMERICA WHEN WE
 HAVE SO MUCH INCOME AND WEALTH
 INEQUALITY.
 WHEN THE PEOPLE ON TOP ARE DOING
 PHENOMENALLY WELL, YEAH, IF YOU
 ARE DOING VERY, VERY WELL IN OUR
 ECONOMY YOU SHOULD BE PAYING
 YOUR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.
 WE WILL RAISE THOSE TAXES FOR
 THE UPPER INCOME PEOPLE.
 WE WILL DO AWAY WITH THE TAX
 LOOPHOLES AND THE TAX BREAKS
 THAT LARGE PRIVATE CORPORATIONS
 CURRENTLY RECEIVE.
 DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW -ANYBODY
 HERE HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW MUCH
 AMAZON PAID IN TAXES LAST YEAR?
 ZERO.
 OWNED BY THE WEALTHIEST GUY IN
 AMERICA.
 THAT'S AN ABSURD TAX SYSTEM AND
 IF ELECTED PRESIDENT I'LL CHANGE
 IT.
 TWO QUICK FOLLOW UPS.
 YOU SAID YOU EXPECT YOUR SALARY
 TO GO BACK DOWN.
 UNLESS I WRITE ANOTHER BEST
 SELLER.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 OR, WHO MAKES MORE THAN THAT?
 WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES MAKE?
 I DON'T KNOW.

 ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU'RE NOT
 GOING TO WIN?
 NO.
 I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
 I'M JUST SAYING THAT I DON'T
 THINK ANYBODY BELIEVES THAT
 BECAUSE I WROTE A BEST SELLER
 THAT I CHANGE MY VIEWS AND
 YOU'LL NOW HEAR ME SAY MAYBE WE
 OUGHT TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO
 MILLIONAIRES.
 SO YOU MADE A LOT MORE MONEY
 THAN YOU DID THE YEAR BEFORE
 BECAUSE OF THE BOOK.
 CHARITABLE DONATIONS WHEN WE
 LOOK AT YOUR TAXES WENT UP BUT
 THEY DIDN'T GO UP
 PROPORTIONALLY.
 I'M NOT COMING AFTER YOU ABOUT
 WHAT YOU GAVE IN YOUR DONATIONS.
 MY QUESTION IS THIS, HAVING THE
 EXPERIENCE OF HAVING MORE MONEY
 AND DECIDING WHAT YOU WANTED TO
 DO WITH IT, DID IT GIVE YOU MORE
 PERSPECTIVE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE
 WITH MORE MONEY FEEL ABOUT THE
 GOVERNMENT OR SOMEBODY LIKE YOU
 FORCING POLICIES THAT DEMAND
 THEM TO GIVE AMOUNTS AS OPPOSED
 TO WHAT THEY WANT TO GIVE?
 AS A MATTER OF FACT IF YOU
 READ THE TAX RETURNS, WE WERE
 NOT AGGRESSIVE.
 WE DIDN'T GO TO ACCOUNTANTS AND
 FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN POSSIBLY
 PAY THE LOWEST AMOUNT IN TAXES.
 PROBABLY PAID MORE THAN WE
 SHOULD HAVE.
 YOU RAISE AN INTERESTING
 QUESTION.
 I GREW UP IN A FAMILY THAT WAS A
 WORKING GLASS FAMILY.
 I LIVED IN A RENT CONTROLLED
 APARTMENT IN NEW YORK.
 I KNEW WHAT PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK
 LIFE WAS ABOUT.
 I KNEW WHAT TENSION WAS ABOUT IN
 A FAMILY.
 I'LL TELL YOU THE DIFFERENCE
 NOW.
 WHEN I WAS A KID MY FAMILY HAD
 TO WORRY ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING
 TO PAY THIS BILL OR HOW THEY'RE
 GOING TO PAY THAT BILL.
 I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
 NOW.
 THAT STRESS IS OFF MY FAMILY AND
 THAT IS A GREAT RELIEF AND I
 HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE AND
 HOPEFULLY WILL CONCLUDE MY
 POLITICAL LIFE IN THE WHITE
 HOUSE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT
 EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY
 DOES NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE
 STRESS OF WHETHER THEY CAN
 AFFORD TO PAY THE ELECTRIC BILL,
 WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
 HEALTH CARE, WHETHER THEY CAN
 SEND THEIR KIDS TO CHILD CARE.
 SO THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THAT I
 HAVE LEARNED.
 IT'S GREAT NOT TO HAVE TO WORRY
 ABOUT WHETHER YOUR ELECTRICITY
 OR PHONE BILL IS GOING TO BE
 SHUT OFF AND I WANT EVERY PERSON
 IN THIS COUNTRY, THE WEALTHIEST
 COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE
 WORLD TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THAT
 KIND OF WAY.
 NEXT QUESTION, SOPHOMORE AT
 HARVARD STUDYING GOVERNMENT FROM
 MINNESOTA.
 GABRIEL.
 HI, SENATOR.
 WHAT IS ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE
 CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT
 RECENTLY?
 NOTHING.
 I'VE BEEN CON SISTENT FOR -JUT
 KIDDING.
 I HAVE BEEN PAYING MORE
 ATTENTION TO FOREIGN POLICY.
 I WAS RIGHTFULLY CRITICIZED THE
 LAST TIME AROUND BECAUSE I
 DIDN'T PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION AS
 I MIGHT.
 THE ECONOMY ISSUES, WHETHER
 PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH CARE AND
 WHETHER THEY HAVE DECENT PAYING
 JOBS AND DEAL WITH CLIMATE
 CHANGE IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT
 BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
 UNITED STATES'S ROLE IN THE
 WORLD AS WELL AND PROBABLY A FEW
 YEARS AGO I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
 AS INVOLVED AS I HAVE RECENTLY
 BEEN IN DEMANDING AND HELPING IN
 THE SENATE TO PASS A RESOLUTION
 TO GET THE UNITED STATES OUT OF
 THE SAUDI LEAD INTERVENTION IN
 YEMEN.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 45
 YEARS UNDER THE WAR POWERS ACT,
 IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED.
 WE DID IT IN THE SENATE AND WE
 DID IT IN THE HOUSE.
 SADLY, TRAGICALLY TRUMP VETOED
 IT.
 BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MORE
 ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES THAN
 I PREVIOUSLY DID.
 ALL RIGHT.
 GOOD PLACE TO STOP.
 WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
 PLEASE COME BACK.
 WE HAVE A LOT MORE OF CNN'S
 SPECIAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 TOWN HALL EVENT RIGHT NOW WITH
 SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
 GO NOWHERE.

 WELCOME BACK TO CNN'S SPECIAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 TOWN HALL EVENT.
 WE'RE LIVE ON THE CAMPUS IN
 MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING WITH
 SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
 QUESTION ABOUT THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION.
 IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR YOUR
 COLLEAGUE SENATOR ELIZABETH
 WARREN SAY ON THIS STAGE
 EARLIER, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO
 POLITICAL INCONVENIENCE
 EXCEPTION TO THE UNITED STATES
 CONSTITUTION.
 HER ARGUMENT WAS IF ANY OTHER
 HUMAN BEING IN THIS COUNTRY HAD
 DONE WHAT IS DOCUMENTED IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT THEY WOULD BE
 ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL AND HE
 IS OBVIOUSLY REFERENCING THIS
 PRESIDENT.
 DO YOU AGREE THAT IT IS TIME FOR
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AS SHE
 SAYS?
 WELL, WHAT I AGREE IS THAT WE
 HAVE THE MOST DANGEROUS
 PRESIDENT IN THE MODERN HISTORY
 OF THIS COUNTRY.
 SOMEBODY WHO IS A PATHOLOGICAL
 LIAR.
 SOMEBODY WHO THE MUELLER REPORT
 SAID LEFT THE QUESTION OPEN
 WHICH CONGRESS HAS TO EXPLORE AS
 TO WHETHER OR NOT HE OBSTRUCTED
 JUSTICE.
 A VERY SERIOUS CRIME.
 TO MY VIEW IS TWOFOLD.
 FIRST IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
 THAT THE CONGRESS HAS GOT TO
 TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THAT AND DO
 A HARD INVESTIGATION AND ASK --
 SUBPOENA THE PEOPLE WHO WERE
 MENTIONED IN THAT REPORT AND GET
 TO THE TRUTH.
 DID TRUMP ACTUALLY OBSTRUCT
 JUSTICE?
 BUT HERE IS MY CONCERN.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT IS
 MOST IMPORTANT TO ME IS TO SEE
 TO EVERYTHING■E SURE THAT THAT .
 BUT IF FOR THE NEXT YEAR ALL THE
 CONGRESS IS TALKING ABOUT IS
 TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP, AND MUELLER
 MUELLER, MUELLER AND WE'RE NOT
 TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND
 RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE TO A
 LIVING WAGE AND WE'RE NOT
 TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND
 SEXISM AND RACISM AND HOMOPHOBIA
 AND THE ISSUES THAT CONCERN
 ORDINARY AMERICANS, I WORRY THAT
 WORKS TO TRUMP'S ADVANTAGE.
 I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A
 THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.
 THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS WILL DO IT.
 I'D APPRECIATE IF MY REPUBLICAN
 COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE HAD THE
 GUTS TO DO IT AS WELL BUT I
 WON'T HOLD MY BREATH.
 I WANT TO SEE THAT
 INVESTIGATION.
 WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES BUT
 RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, THAT'S IT.
 SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU
 ARE ON IMPEACHMENT YET BUT WHAT
 IF YOU REVERSE YOUR ARGUMENT AND
 SAY YOU JUST HAD THAT ANSWERED
 TWICE.
 MUELLER SAID HE COULDN'T COME TO
 A CONCLUSION.
 HE CAN'T EXONERATE AND CAN'T
 PROSECUTE AND YOU HAD THE DEPUTY
 AG SAY NO OBSTRUCTION.
 YOU GOT YOUR ANSWER TWICE.
 WHY LOOK AGAIN?
 NO, THE ISSUE OF OBSTRUCTION,
 MUELLER SAID THAT'S AN OPEN
 QUESTION AND THAT'S SOMETHING
 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 SHOULD LOOK AT.
 AND THE AG AND DEPUTY AG SAID
 NO OBSTRUCTION.
 I'D RATHER HAVE AN OBJECTIVE
 INVESTIGATION DONE BY THE HOUSE.
 NEXT QUESTION.
 SAMANTHA IS A SOPHOMORE AT
 HARVARD STUDYING SOCIAL STUDIES
 FROM CALIFORNIA.
 I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION
 THAT I DIDN'T SAY YOUR NAME
 RIGHT.
 IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT I
 SAID.
 A LIFETIME OF IT.
 IT'S OKAY.
 HI SENATOR SANDERS, SO MY
 FATHER'S FAMILY LEFT SOVIET
 RUSSIA IN 1979 FLEAEING FROM TH
 SAME SOCIALIST POLICIES YOU SEEM
 EAGER TO PUT IN THIS COUNTRY.
 HOW DO YOU RECTIFY IT WITH THE
 FAILURES OF SOCIALISM IN EVERY
 COUNTRY THAT HAS TRIED IT.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.
 IS IT YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT I
 BELIEVED IN AUTHORITARIAN
 COMMUNISM THAT WAS IN THE SOVIET
 UNION.
 I HAVEN'T AND I OPPOSED IT.
 I BELIEVE IN A VIGOROUS POLICY.
 YOU ASKED ME ABOUT DEMOCRATIC
 SOCIALISM.
 FAIR QUESTION AND LET ME ANSWER
 IT.
 I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT IN THE
 UNITED STATES THERE IS SOMETHING
 FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG WHEN WE HAVE
 THREE FAMILIES OWNING MORE
 WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM HALF OF
 AMERICAN SOCIETY.
 160 MILLION PEOPLE.
 SOMETHING WRONG WHEN THE TOP 1%
 OWNS MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM

 SOMETHING VERY WRONG WHEN 49% OF
 ALL NEW INCOME TODAY IS GOING TO
 THE TOP 1%.
 AND SOMETHING IS EQUALLY WRONG
 WHEN WE HAVE A CORRUPT POLITICAL
 SYSTEM MADE WORSE BY THIS
 DISASTROUS CITIZEN'S UNITED
 SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT
 ALLOWS BILLIONAIRES TO SPEND
 UNLIMITED SUMS OF MONEY TO ELECT
 CANDIDATES THAT REPRESENT THE
 WEALTHY.
 SO ANSWER NUMBER ONE, IT'S A
 RADICAL IDEA.
 MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY AGREES BUT I
 HAPPEN TO BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE
 A GOVERNMENT THAT REPRESENTS
 WORKING FAMILIES AND NOT JUST
 THE 1% AND POWERFUL
 CORPORATIONS.
 THAT'S POINT NUMBER ONE.
 POINT NUMBER TWO, WHAT DO I MEAN
 WHEN I TALK ABOUT DEMOCRATIC
 SOCIALISM?
 IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE
 AUTHORITARIAN COMMUNISM THAT
 EXISTED IN THE SOVIET UNION.
 THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS.
 IT MEANS THAT WE CHERISH AMONG
 OTHER THINGS OUR BILL OF RIGHTS.
 FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT MADE THIS
 POINT.
 IN 1944 IN A STATE OF THE UNION
 ADDRESS THAT NEVER GOT A LOT OF
 ATTENTION, THIS IS WHAT HE SAID
 BASICALLY.
 A VERY PROFOUND SPEECH.
 HE SAID WE GOT A GREAT
 CONSTITUTION.
 BILL OF RIGHTS PROTECTS YOUR
 FREEDOM OF RELIGION.
 FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY, FREEDOM OF
 SPEECH BUT IT DOESN'T PROTECT
 AND GUARANTEE YOU ECONOMIC
 RIGHTS.
 SO LET ME BE HONEST WITH YOU, I
 BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRATIC
 CIVILIZED SOCIETY HEALTH CARE IS
 A HUMAN RIGHT.
 GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE THAT
 HAPPEN.
 I BELIEVE THAT EVERY YOUNG
 PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY
 REGARDLESS OF HIS OR HER INCOME
 HAS THE RIGHT TO GET ALL THE
 EDUCATION THEY NEED.
 THAT'S WHY I HAVE FOUGHT HARD
 WITH SOME SUCCESS TO MOVE TOWARD
 MAKING PUBLIC COLLEGES AND
 UNIVERSITIES TUITION FREE AND
 VERY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE
 STUDENT DEBT.
 AND I BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING
 WRONG WHEN YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF
 FAMILIES PAYING 40 OR 50% OF
 THEIR LIMITED INCOMES TO PUT A
 ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS AND THAT
 MILLIONS OF WORKING CLASS
 FAMILIES, YOUNG PARENTS CANNOT
 FIND QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE
 CHILD CARE.
 SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE VERY,
 VERY RICH GETTING RICHER AND
 MIDDLE CLASS STRUGGLING AND 40
 MILLION LIVING IN POVERTY.
 IT MEANS TO ME THAT WE EXPAND
 MEDICARE AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL
 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS.
 WE REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING
 INFRASTRUCTURE.
 IN OTHER WORDS GOVERNMENT SERVES
 THE NEEDS OF ALL PEOPLE RATHER
 THAN JUST WEALTHY CAMPAIGN
 CONTRIBUTORS.
 THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO ME.
 YOU WERE ASKED EARLIER ON AS
 A QUICK FOLLOW UP TO THIS, WHAT
 DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT
 NOW?
 YOU USED TO ARGUE THAT YOU
 SHOULD HAVE GOVERNMENT CONTROL
 THE MEANS OF CAPITALISM.
 WHEN DID I SAY THAT?
 IN THE 70s.
 WHAT DID YOU SAY IN THE 70s?
 GAGA GOO GOO.
 WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU HAVE
 CHANGED.
 WAIT A MINUTE, FIRST OF ALL,
 HE HEARS ME CRITICIZING MEDIA
 ALL THE TIME AND HE GETS NERVOUS
 ABOUT IT.
 ONE OF MANY THINGS THAT MAKES
 ME NERVOUS.
 I WAS A MAYOR OF A CITY FOR 8
 YEARS.
 I SAID WHAT I SAID AND THAT IS
 THAT I WANT TO LIVE IN A NATION
 IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE IN THE
 WEALTHIEST NATION OF THE HISTORY
 OF THE WORLD CAN HAVE A DECENT
 STANDARD OF LIVING.
 I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT EVERYBODY
 OWNING A BIG FANCY HOUSE OR
 CADILLAC OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
 BUT THE IDEAS ARE NOT TO
 RADICAL.
 HEALTH CARE AS A RIGHT EXISTS IN
 VIRTUALLY ANY OTHER MAJOR
 COUNTRY ON EARTH.
 DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW HOW MUCH
 IT COSTS TO GO TO COLLEGE IN
 GERMANY?
 IT'S.
 I SAID IN FINLAND COLLEGE IS
 FREE.
 HE SAID IT'S NOT FREE.
 HE SAID THEY PAY US TO GO TO
 COLLEGE.
 SO THESE ARE IDEAS ABOUT
 GUARANTEEING ECONOMIC RIGHTS TO
 WORKING PEOPLE RATHER THAN
 SEEING PEOPLE WORKING TWO OR
 THREE JOBS, $8 OR $9 AN HOUR
 LIVING UNDER GREAT STRESS AND
 MARRIAGES DISSOLVING AS A
 RESULT.
 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.
 I BELIEVE IN A NATION IN WHICH
 WE GUARANTEE FUNDAMENTAL
 ECONOMIC RIGHTS, BASIC
 NECESSITIES OF LIFE.
 YOU SAID YOU HAVLSO BEEN
 THINKING MORE ABOUT FOREIGN
 POLICY.
 LET'S GET A QUESTION ON THAT.
 SHELLY, A JUNIOR AT HARVARD
 AS A YOUNG MAN ABOUT YOUR AGE
 I SPENT A NUMBER OF MONTHS IN
 ISRAEL.
 I HAVE FAMILY IN ISRAEL.
 I AM NOT ANTIISRAEL BUT THE FACT
 OF THE MATTER IS THAT NETANYAHU
 IS A RIGHT WING POLITICIAN WHO I
 THINK IS TREATING THE
 PALESTINIAN PEOPLE EXTREMELY
 UNFAIRLY.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 SO WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE
 UNITED STATES GIVES BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS IN MILITARY AID TO
 ISRAEL.
 WHAT I BELIEVE IS NOT RADICAL.
 I JUST BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED
 STATES SHOULD DEAL WITH THE
 MIDDLE EAST ON A LEVEL PLAYING
 FIELD BASIS.
 IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOAL MUST BE
 TO TRY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER
 AND NOT JUST SUPPORT ONE
 COUNTRY, WHICH IS NOW RUN BY A
 RIGHT WING, DARE I SAY, RACIST
 GOVERNMENT.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 SO I AM 100% PRO-ISRAEL.
 THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT IN THE
 WORLD TO EXIST AND TO EXIST IN
 PEACE AND SECURITY AND NOT BE
 SUBJECTED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS
 BUT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO
 DEAL NOT JUST WITH ISRAEL BUT
 WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AS
 WELL.
 ANOTHER QUESTION, NICHOLAS
 ST. GERMAIN.
 HE'S AN ASPIRING POLICE OFFICER.
 GOOD.
 WHAT IS YOUR STANCE ON
 PUTTING ARMED GUARDS OR
 HEIGHTENED POLICE PRESENCE
 INSIDE OF SCHOOLS?
 I'M AGAINST IT.
 BUT LET ME ALSO --
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 LET ME SAY THIS TO NICHOLAS
 AND TO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE, WE
 NEED FUNDAMENTAL REFORM IN OUR
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS
 VERY, VERY BROKEN NOW.
 AND I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT
 YOU'RE GOING INTO CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE.
 WE NEED A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO
 GET INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 AND TO HELP US TRANSFORM A
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS
 NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW.
 WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN
 ANY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY ON
 EARTH.
 MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN CHINA
 DOES.
 DISPROPORTIONALLY AFRICAN
 AMERICAN, LATINO, AND NATIVE
 AMERICANS.
 WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST, IN MY
 VIEW, IN MY VIEW WE HAVE GOT TO
 INVEST IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN
 JOBS AND EDUCATION.
 WE HAVE A LOT OF KIDS HANGING
 OUT ON STREET CORNERS.
 THEY'RE GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN
 DESTRUCTIVE AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE
 ACTIVITY.
 IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME AT A
 TIME WHEN WE'RE SPENDING $80
 BILLION A YEAR LOCKING FELLOW
 AMERICANS UP, WE HAVE TO END THE
 SO-CALLED WAR ON DRUGS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN
 DESTROYED BECAUSE OF CRIMINAL
 RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH
 POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA AND I'M
 DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT NOT ONLY
 STATE AFTER STATE ARE LEGALIZING
 MARIJUANA BUT ALSO SOME
 COMM MOVING TO EXPONGE
 THE RECORDS OF PEOPLE IN
 POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA.
 BUT ALSO WE NEED POLICE
 DEPARTMENT REFORM AND WHAT THAT
 MEANS IS WE HAVE A LOT OF
 DEPARTMENTS THAT SPEND MORE TIME
 ON TEACHING THE OFFICERS HOW TO
 SHOOT A GUN AND LESS TIME ON
 TEACHING THEM HOW TO BREAK UP
 DISTURBANCES IN A NON-LETHAL
 WAY.
 BEING A COP IS AN ENORMOUSLY
 IMPORTANT JOB AND DIFFICULT JOB
 AND MOST POLICE OFFICERS TO MY
 MIND, I WAS A MAYOR FOR YEARS.
 THEY'RE TRYING HARD AND TRYING
 TO DO THE RIGHT THING UNDER VERY
 DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.
 BUT ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE
 SHOULD MAKE AND AS PRESIDENT I
 WILL HELP LEAD THAT EFFORT IS
 THAT LETHAL FORCE, USE OF A
 WEAPON TO KILL SOMEBODY SHOULD
 BE THE LAST RESPONSE, NOT AS IS
 TOO OFTEN THE CASE, THE FIRST
 RESPONSE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 LET'S BRING IN GEORGIA.
 GE
 GEORGIA IS A SOPHOMORE HERE
 STUDYING ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
 FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
 THANK YOU.
 HI, SENATOR.
 GIVEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL
 CLIMATE IN A NATION THAT'S SO
 POLARIZED WHAT WILL YOU DO TO
 REACH ACROSS THE AISLE TO
 COMPROMISE WITH THE GOP?
 WELL, I HAVE DONE THAT
 THROUGHOUT MY POLITICAL CAREER.
 IT MAY SURPRISE SOME PEOPLE BUT
 THERE WERE YEARS WHEN I WAS IN
 THE U.S. HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES THAT I PASSED
 MORE AMENDMENTS IN A GIVEN YEAR
 THAN ANY OTHER CONGRESSMAN
 BECAUSE I REACHED ACROSS THE
 AISLE AND FOUND COMMON GROUND
 WITH REPUBLICANS WHO AGREED WITH
 ME ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE AND I
 MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THAT I
 WAS VERY PROUD TO HAVE HELPED
 PASS RESOLUTION IN THE SENATE TO
 GET THE UNITED STATES OUT OF THE
 WAR IN YEMEN AND THE CO-SPONSOR
 WAS A VERY CONSERVATIVE
 REPUBLICAN FROM UTAH NAMED MIKE
 LEE AND I THINK THAT IF THERE IS
 GOOD LEADERSHIP IN THE WHITE
 HOUSE, IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE
 IS A LOT MORE COCOMMONALITY OF
 INTERESTS THAN THE MEDIA OFTEN
 PORTRAYS AND WE CAN BRING PEOPLE
 TOGETHER ON THAT.
 FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER YOU'RE A
 REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT OR AN
 INDEPENDENT, YOU KNOW THERE'S
 SOMETHING WRONG WHEN OUR
 INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING.
 OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND WASTE
 WATER PLANTS.
 I BELIEVE I CAN BRING
 REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
 TOGETHER TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT,
 IF WE REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING
 INFRASTRUCTURE WE MAKE SURE THAT
 EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY HAS CLEAN
 DRINKING WATER AND PEOPLE'S CARS
 DON'T GET DESTROYED WHEN THEY GO
 THROUGH A POTHOLE, I THINK WE
 CAN HAVE REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR
 A SENSIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE
 PROGRAM.
 ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THIS COUNTRY
 AND I THINK EVERYBODY
 UNDERSTANDS IT IS BEING RIPPED
 OFF BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL
 INDUSTRY.
 WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE
 WORLD FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
 THE TEN MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL
 COMPANIES MADE $69 BILLION IN
 PROFIT AND YET ONE IN FIVE
 AMERICANS CAN'T AFFORD THE
 MEDICINE THEY NEED.
 THEY ARE INCREDIBLY GREEDY I
 THINK A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS
 KNOW THAT AND I THINK THAT WE
 CAN WORK TOGETHER AND WE HAVE
 VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS TO DO THAT
 TO CUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
 IN THIS COUNTRY IN HALF SO THAT
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT
 PAYING ANY MORE.
 LET'S HOLD IT THERE AND TAKE
 A BREAK.
 WHEN WE COME BACK WE HAVE MORE
 WITH SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
 STAY WITH CNN.

 There goes our first big order.


        How many of these         did they order?
         Ooh, that's hot.

  You know, we could sell these.
               Nah.

          We don't bake.

           Opportunity.
  What we deliver by delivering.
    <i> New Lysol Wipes are crazy</i>    <i> strong.</i>
        <i> Don't believe us?</i>
   <i> We got this workout class to</i>   <i> compare them to Clorox.</i>
                             Wow!
               <i> Feel the strength</i>
             <i> of new Lysol Wipes.</i>
                            Dude!
         Are you looking at this?
 Can I take those?
                              No.
            <i> Lysol. What it takes</i>            <i> to protect.®</i>

        Hey, who are you?
 Oh, hey Jeff, I'm a car thief...
              What?!
           I'm here to     steal your car because,
       well, that's my job.
              What?
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What?!
             [crash]
              WHAT?!
        Haha, it happens.
        And if you've got     cut-rate car insurance,
      paying for this could
 feel like getting robbed twice.
        So get Allstate...
     and be better protected
          from Mayhem...
             like me.

       <i> You wouldn't accept</i>        <i> an incomplete job</i>
        <i> from any one else.</i>
          <i> Why accept it</i>     <i> from your allergy pills?</i>
         <i> Flonase relieves</i>       <i> your worst symptoms</i>
   <i> including nasal congestion,</i>
     <i> which most pills don't.</i>
    <i> Flonase helps block 6 key</i>     <i> inflammatory substances.</i>
    <i> Most pills only block one.</i>
 <i>Flonase.</i>
 WELCOME BACK. WE'RE LIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR
 CNN'S SPECIAL DEMOCRATIC TOWN
 HALL.
 WE'RE LIVE WITH BERNIE SANDERS
 FROM VERMONT.
 HOW ABOUT TAXES.
 LET'S BRING IN KYLE FROM RHODE
 ISLAND.
 HE'S A FRESHMAN HERE STUDYING
 CL
 CLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY.
 YOUR PLAN FOR FREE COLLEGE
 APPEALS TO MANY STUDENTS HERE.
 ONE OF THE METHODS YOU PROPOSED
 WOULD BE THROUGH RAISING TAXES
 ON THE WEALTHY.
 BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH A COLLEGE
 EDUCATION TEND TO HAVE HIGHER
 INCOMES COULD THIS PLAN
 EVENTUALLY HURT US?
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 I THINK WHAT OUR CAMPAIGN IS
 ABOUT IS JUSTICE.
 IT'S A FIGHT FOR JUSTICE.
 ECONOMIC JUSTICE, SOCIAL
 JUSTICE, RACIAL JUSTICE,
 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND AT THE
 END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE TO ASK
 YOURSELF WHETHER IT'S ACCEPTABLE
 THAT CORPORATIONS LIKE AMAZON,
 NETFLIX, GENERAL MOTORS PAY
 NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES.
 WHETHER TRUMP'S TAX PROPOSAL
 GIVES MASSIVE TAX BREAKS TO
 FAMILIES LIKE THE KOCH BROTHERS.
 ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST FAMILIES
 IN AMERICA.
 SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS A
 FAIR AND PROGRESSIVE TAX SYSTEM
 IN ORDER TO RAISE THE REVENUE
 THAT WE NEED TO HELP WORKING
 FAMILIES.
 SO I HAVE NO APOLOGIES TO MAKE
 TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR
 BEST TO END THE TAX HAVENS THAT
 EXIST IN BERMUDA AND OTHER
 COUNTRIES.
 AND THEN THEY'RE CUTTING BACK ON
 EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE.
 THAT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
 TO ME.
 SO I DO BELIEVE THAT VERY
 WEALTHY PEOPLE AND PROFITABLE
 CORPORATIONS SHOULD BEGIN TO PAY
 THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.
 I HAVE TO TELL YOU, TRUMP'S TAX
 PROPOSAL THAT GAVE A TRILLION TO
 THE TOP 1% AND LARGE PROFITABLE
 CORPORATIONS DRIVING UP THE
 DEFICIT WAS AN OUTRAGE.
 IF ELECTED PRESIDENT I WILL
 RESCIND THOSE TAX BREAKS.
 SENATOR WARREN OBVIOUSLY ON
 EARLY TONIGHT ARGUABLY GOES
 FURTHER THAN YOU BECAUSE SHE HAS
 A PIECE IN HER PLAN ABOUT DEBT
 FORGI
 FORGIVENESS.
 IF YOUR FAMILY MAKES 100,000 OR
 LESS YOU CAN FORGIVE UP TO
 50,000 IN STUDENT LOANS.
 DO YOU SUPPORT HER PLAN?
 I HAVEN'T STUDIED IT BUT I
 THINK ELIZABETH AND I END UP
 AGREEING ON A WHOLE LOT OF
 ISSUES AND WHAT SHE UNDERSTANDS
 AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS WE
 DON'T PUNISH PEOPLE FOR THE
 CRIME OF GETTING A HIGHER
 EDUCATION.
 I HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM
 HOWARD UNIVERSITY THAT ARE
 TEACHERS IN MY OFFICE A COUPLE
 OF WEEKS AGO.
 THIS FELLOW WORKING AS A TEACHER
 GETTING HIS MASTERS DEGREE.
 $182,000 IN DEBT.
 HOW DO YOU PAY THAT OFF ON A
 TEACHER'S SALARY.
 I TALKED TO A YOUNG DOCTOR,
 $300,000 IN DEBT.
 SO WE HAVE TO DO AS I SAID
 EARLIER, TWO THINGS.
 I'M PROUD.
 I RAISED THIS ISSUE.
 FOUR YEARS AGO.
 EVERYBODY FOUR YEARS AGO SAYS
 BERNIE IS A LITTLE BIT CRAZY,
 TALKING ABOUT MAKING PUBLIC
 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
 TUITION FREE.
 AIN'T SUCH A CRAZY IDEA TODAY.
 WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE BEST WAY
 TO DO IT.
 AND WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENCES ON
 IT.
 PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FORGO
 GETTING MARRIED OR A CAR FOR
 HAVING A COLLEGE EDUCATION.
 PEOPLE SAY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
 PAY FOR THAT?
 GET BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT
 THE YOUNG MAN ASKED A MOMENT
 AGO.
 YEAH, WHEN WALL STREET WAS
 BAILED OUT BY CONGRESS TO THE
 TUNE OF AT LEAST $1 TRILLION,
 DON'T TELL ME WE DON'T HAVE
 ENOUGH MONEY IN THIS COUNTRY TO
 SUBSTANTIALLY' REDUCE STUDENT
 DEBT.
 ANOTHER QUESTION.
 SHE'S A FRESHMAN AT HARVARD
 STUDYING GOVERNMENT AND
 ECONOMICS.
 SHE'S FROM CALIFORNIA.
 WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION.
 HI, SENATOR SANDERS.
 THE GREEN NEW DEAL REALLY
 ENERGIZED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 RECENTLY AND WHILE I COMPLETELY
 AGREE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE NEEDS
 TO BE ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES,
 MY CONCERN HAS BEEN LACK OF
 SPECIFICITY AND DETAILED
 POLICIES AS TO HOW WE WILL
 ACTUALLY BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL.
 WHAT ARE SPECIFIC REFORMS YOU
 HAVE AND HOW WILL YOU ENSURE
 THAT FEASIBLE SUPPORT IS GIVEN
 TO CARBON HEAVY INDUSTRIES THAT
 WILL BE MOST IMPACTED TO EASE
 THAT TRANSITION.
 GOOD.
 EXCELLENT QUESTION.
 ALL THE OTHERS WERE EXCELLENT
 TOO.
 THIS IS WHERE I COME FROM ON
 THIS ISSUE AND I HAVE TO TELL
 YOU A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I
 INTRODUCED THE MOST SWEEPING
 LEGISLATION TO COMBAT CLIMATE
 CHANGE IN THE HISTORY OF THE
 SENATE.
 HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.
 YOU KNOW THIS, THE SCIENTISTS
 KNOW THE ISSUE THE BEST.
 SOME MONTHS AGO MADE IT CLEAR
 THAT IF WE DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY
 TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY
 FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND ENERGY
 EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE
 ENERGIES, THIS PLANET AND OUR
 COUNTRY SUFFER IRREPARABLE
 DAMAGE.
 SO TO ME, THE ISSUE OF MOVING
 VERY AGGRESSIVELY ON CLIMATE
 CHANG IS A MORAL ISSUE BECAUSE
 IT SPEAKS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE
 ARE GOING TO LEAVE THIS COUNTRY
 AND OUR PLANET AND I'VE GOT
 SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN INCLUDING
 THREE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN A
 WAY THAT IS HEALTHY AND
 HABITABLE.
 AND IF WE DO NOT ACT
 AGGRESSIVELY IT WILL BE A
 DISASTER IN MY VIEW FOR THE
 ENTIRE PLANET AND THE UNITED
 STATES.
 TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, WHAT
 DOES THAT MEAN?
 IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE GOT TO
 TAKE ON THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY
 AND MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE
 ARE MOVING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL
 AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT BLAMING
 THOSE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE
 COAL INDUSTRY OR THE GAS
 INDUSTRY OR THE OIL INDUSTRY.
 ALL THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS FEED
 THEIR FAMILIES.
 AND WE SUPPORT THAT.
 SO WE IN ALL OF THE LEGISLATION,
 WE HAVE MANY, MANY MILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS TO GO INTO THOSE
 COMMUNITIES TO HELP WORKERS GET
 THE TRAINING AND THE EDUCATION
 THAT THEY NEED TO GET JOBS THAT
 WILL PAY THEM AS MUCH AND EVEN
 MORE.OVE AGGRESSIVELY TOWARD
 ENERGY EFFICIENCY.
 ONE OF THE POINTS THE GREEN NEW
 DEAL MAKES IS WE HAVE THE
 POTENTIAL TO CREATE MILLIONS OF
 GOOD PAYING JOBS AS WE TRANSFORM
 OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY FROM
 FOSSIL FUEL.
 THERE ARE BUILDINGS ALL OVER NEW
 ENGLAND, HOMES ALL OVER NEW
 ENGLAND THAT ARE WASTING AN
 ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY.
 WE CAN WEATHERIZE THOSE HOMES.
 I'VE BEEN IN HOMES IN VERMONT
 WHERE FUEL WENT DOWN BY 50%
 BECAUSE PEOPLE GOT THE
 INSULATION AND WINDOWS AND
 ROOFING THEY NEEDED.
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN BE HELPED
 IN THAT RESPECT.
 WE SHOULD INVEST VERY
 SIGNIFICANTLY IN SOLAR AND IN
 WIND.
 I KNOW THE PRESIDENT THINKS THAT
 WIND TURBINES CAUSE CANCER, ONLY
 PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HAPPENS
 TO BELIEVE THAT, BUT WE CAN MOVE
 AGGRESSIVELY TOWARD, AND SHOULD.
 WIND AND SOLAR, WE HAVE GOT TO
 RETHINK OUR TRANSPORTATION
 SYSTEM AND BUILD THE KIND OF
 STATE OF THE ART RAIL SYSTEM
 THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS WHICH
 WILL HELP US TRANSPORT PEOPLE
 AND CARGO IN A MUCH MORE
 NONPOLLUTING WAY.
 THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THIS IS AN
 ISSUE THAT WE CANNOT RUN AWAY
 FROM.
 AND OF ALL MY DISAGREEMENTS WITH
 TRUMP ON VIRTUALLY EVERY ISSUE
 THE IDEA THAT HE CONTINUES TO
 TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AS A
 HOAX OR NOT REAL IS SO DANGEROUS
 AND SO HARMFUL, NOT ONLY TO OUR
 COUNTRY AND THE WORLD, THE
 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA UNDER A
 SANDERS PRESIDENCY WILL LEAD THE
 WORLD IN TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY
 SYSTEM, CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS,
 CREATE A LESS POLLUTING SOCIETY.
 AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE NO
 CHOICE BUT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE
 HAVE TO DO.
 ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING IN
 NATHAN WILLIAMS, A SENIOR,
 STUDYING EURO SCIENCE AT
 HARVARD, FROM CALIFORNIA,
 NATHAN.
 GOOD EVENING, SENATOR
 SANDERS.
 IF ELECTED YOU WOULD BE THE
 OLDEST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY
 OF THE UNITED STATES YET IN 2016
 THE MENIALS FAVORED YOU STRONGLY
 OVER HILLARY CLINTON.
 WHY DO YOU THINK YOUNG PEOPLE
 HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED TO YOUR
 CAMPAIGNS AND HOW WILL YOU
 ENSURE OUR VOICES ARE
 REPRESENTED IN YOUR
 ADMINISTRATION.
 YOUNG PEOPLE ARE VERY SMART,
 THAT'S CLEAR.
 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
 THIS IS THE TRUTH, NATHAN, WHEN
 WE BEGAN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN IF
 ANYBODY THOUGHT WE HAD SOME
 DIABOLICAL PLAN, HOW ARE WE
 GOING TO REACH OUT TO YOUNG
 PEOPLE?
 NOT TRUE AT ALL.
 IT JUST HAPPENED BECAUSE IT
 HAPPENED.
 HERE'S WHY I THINK IT HAPPENED.
 FIRST OF ALL, YOUR GENERATION IS
 THE MOST PROGRESSIVE GENERATION
 IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY.
 YOUR GENERATION MORE THAN ANY
 PREVIOUS GENERATION IS
 ANTI-RACIST, ANTI-SEXIST, ANTI
 HOMOPHOBIA, ANTI RELIGIOUS
 BIGOTRY AND YOU SHOULD BE VERY,
 VERY PROUD OF THAT.
 BUT THE OTHER THING, AND I THINK
 THAT MY CAMPAIGN KIND OF SPEAKS
 TO THE IDEALISM OF YOUNG PEOPLE
 WHO KNOW THAT -WHO UNDERSTAND
 WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY IS NOT --
 WE'RE NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
 AND YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY
 TO WANT TO THINK BIGGER THAN
 OLDER GENERATIONS.
 THE SECOND POINT, TO BE MORE
 SPECIFIC, YOUR GENERATION,
 UNLESS WE TURN THINGS AROUND,
 WILL BE THE FIRST GENERATION IN
 THE MODERN HISTORY OF AMERICA TO
 HAVE A LOWER STANDARD OF LIVING
 THAN YOUR PARENTS.
 ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
 IN RECENT YEARS IS AN EXPLOSION
 IN TECHNOLOGY.
 WE HAVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION IN
 WORKER PRODUCTIVITY.
 BUT EVERYTHING BEING EQUAL MANY
 PEOPLE IN YOUR GENERATION WILL
 EARN LESS MONEY THAN YOUR
 PARENTS, YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE
 SCHOOL MORE DEEPLY IN DEBT THAN
 YOUR PARENTS, YOU'RE GOING TO
 HAVE A HARDER TIME FINDING
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN YOUR
 PARENTS.
 SO THE ISSUES THAT -AND YOUR
 GENERATION ALSO, OBVIOUSLY, IS
 VERY, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT
 CLIMATE CHANGE AND RACIAL
 JUSTICE AND IMMIGRATION REFORM
 AND SO FORTH.
 SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE
 REASONS WHY OUR MESSAGE HAS
 RESONATED WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.
 SENATOR SANDERS, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 THANK YOU.

 ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE THREE TOWN
 HALLS DOWN, TWO MORE TO GO
 TONIGHT.
 A FIVE-HOUR, FIVE CANDIDATE
 EVENT.
 AT 11:00 P.M. WE'LL BE HEARING
 FROM MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG ON
 THIS STAGE.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, SENATOR
 KAMALA HARRIS.
