 BOMANI: I AM SO CONFUSED.
 I CAN'T FIND THE YEAR.
 PABLO: WHAT YEAR ARE WE TALKING
 ABOUT?
 BOMANI: THE YEAR YOU WON.
 THEY ONLY GIVE THOSE TO YOU IF
 YOU WON.
 ARE YOU A MEMBER?
 PABLO: I GET I IS NEXT WEEK.
 THANK■QQ■ GET IT.
 BOMANI: NO, NO, NO.
 I FEEL LIKE IF YOU ARE A
 MEMBER, THAT IS A REALLY BIG
 DEAL.
 PABLO: I WORE THE COAT TODAY
 BECAUSE I KNEW I COULDN'T WEAR
 IT NEXT WEEK.
 YOU WOULD HAVE MADE FUN OF ME.
 BOMANI: ARE YOU THE FIRST■■■
 FILIPINO TO JOIN AUGUSTA
 NATIONAL?
 PABLO: FIRST NAME, THE BUCKS.
 MILWAUKEE CLINCHED THE BEST
 RECORD IN THE LEAGUE, SECURING
 HOME COURT IN THE PLAYOFFS.
 GIANNIS HAT 45-13-6-5 AND THEY
 DID IT WITHOUT ONE ERIC
 BLEDSOE, WHO GOT ELI JECTED
 LESS THAN -EJECTED LESS THAN
 THREE MINUTES INTO THE GAME.
 LET'S WATCH HOW THAT HAPPENED.
 [LAUGHTER]
 BOMANI: IT IS THE REACTION TIME
 THAT MADE IT SO AMAZING.
 PABLO: RIGHT AWAY.
 BLEDSOE DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE,
 IT SEEMS BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED
 SO IMMEDIATELY.
 BOMANI: I DON'T THINK THAT WAS
 EJECTION-WORTHY.
 PABLO: IF YOU ARE THROWING A
 BASKETBALL AT SOMEONE, MAYBE HE
 THINKS LET ME GET OUT AHEAD OF
 THIS.
 BOMANI: HE GOT THROWN AT FIRST.
 ERIC BLEDSOE, STAY READY.
 PABLO: YES.
 BO, THIS WAS SOMETHING OF A
 STATEMENT WIN FOR THE BUCKS
 LAST NIGHT, WAS IT NOT?
 BOMANI: THE SIXERS DON'T HAVE
 BUTLER BRLT, BUT MIROTIC IS NOT
 PLAYING FOR THE BUCKS.
 MALCOLM BROGDON IS STILL NOT
 BACK FOR THE BUCKS.
 WHAT BUCKS TEAM WE GET IN THE
 FIRST ROUND IS NOT GOING TO BE
 THE SAME TEAM WE GET IN THE
 SECOND ROUND IF THEY ARE THERE.
 THESE ARE TWO LEGITIMATE CON
 DENIEDERS, AND THE BUCKS WENT
 THIS THERE AND WON IT LATE.
 THIS WASN'T JUST SMOOTH
 SAILING.
 THEY WERE DOWN LATE AND PULLED
 IT OUT AT THE END.
 PABLO: GIANNIS KILLED THE
 SIXERS THE THE OTHER TWO GAMES,
 32-189-10, AND 52-16-7.
 LAST NIGHT IN SPECIFIC WE SAW
 HIM BLOCK JOEL EMBIID FOUR
 TEAMS.
 EMBIID HAS NEVER BEEN BLOCKED
 SO MANY TIMES BY A SINGLE
 PLAYER.
 WE SAW HIM DO THAT TO EMBIID.
 WE SAW HIM PUT HIS SHOULDER
 INTO SIMMONS SIMMONS OTHER AND
 OVER AGAIN AND BACK HIM DOWN.
 BUTLER OR NOT, ANTETOKOUNMPO
 SEEMS TO BE A NIGHTMARE MATCH
 UP FOR THE SIXERS.
 BOMANI: SIMMONS TOOK FIVE OR
 SIX SHOTS.
 WHAT MAKES US INTRIGUED ABOUT
 THE SIXERS?
 THEY HAVE ONE OF THE BEST
 STARTING FIVES IN THE NBA.
 IT IS THOSE TWO GUYS RIGHT NOW,
 SIMMONS AND EMBIID, THE
 PROCESS.
 THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY IS
 EXCITED ABOUT.
 WHEN YOU SEE EMBIID PLAY
 AGAINST GUYS OF SIMILAR SIZE,
 THEY BRING IT RIGHT BACK TO
 HIM, AND THAT IS MORE THAN AT
 TIMES HE IS ABLE TO HANDLE.
 THIS POSTSEASON IS GOING TO BE
 A FASCINATING REFERENDUM ON
 WHAT THE SIXERS OR AND ARE NOT.
 PABLO: THEY HAVE A COACH TASKED
 WITH UNLOCKING THE MOST
 TALENTED STARTING FIVE AS YOU
 MENTIONED, AND BRETT BROWN HAS
 NOT PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS.
 MAYBE HE HAS A GUY WHO CAN'T
 SHOOT THAT NOBODY ELSE IN THE
 EASTERN CONFERENCE FEARS IN THE
 POSTSEASON IN BEN SIMMONS.
 THAT IS TRUE.
 BUT IN THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS,
 THEY HAVE A COACH IN MIKE
 BUDENHOLZER, WHO HAS UNLOCK THE
 AN OFFENSE IN WAYS THAT IS
 COACH OF THE YEAR WORTHY AND
 THAT MUST MAKE OTHER TEAMS
 JEALOUS AS WELL.
 BOMANI: IN THE END, YOU GRIND
 DOWN, AND YOU NEED GUYS TO GET
 THEIR OWN SHOT.
 HOW MANY SHOTS CAN GIANNIS GET
 FOR HIMSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE.
 THAT IS THE QUESTION.
 YOU MENTIONED BRETT BROWN.
 HE WENT BE AROUND NEXT YEAR.
 PABLO: IF AL HORFORD MURDERS
 BRETT BROWN, I WOULD HAVE TO
 SAY I GET IT.
 BOMANI: THE FINAL FOUR.
 AUBURN TAKES ON VIRGINIA, AND
 TEXAS TECH STATES ON MICHIGAN
 STATE FOR THE RIGHT TO PLAY IN
 THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
 THERE IS NO ZION.
 DOES THAT SUCK THE OXYGEN OUT
 OF THE TOURNAMENT?
 PABLO: I AM GOING TO SAY IT IS
 NICE FOR VIRGINIA, TEXAS TECH,
 AUBURN AND ONE OTHER.
 IF THEY COUNTERED THIS FINAL
 FOUR WITH CAMERA IN THE GYM
 THAT ZION WILLIAMSON IS PLAYING
 IN, WHAT WU BE WATCH SOMETHING
 I WOULD BE WATCHING ZION
 WILLIAMSON.
 BOMANI: THE THING THEY HAVE GOT
 HERE IS THIS SHOULD BE GOOD
 BASKETBALL.
 WE HAD AS GOOD AN ELITE EIGHT
 WEEKEND AS WE CAN REMEMBER
 THERE BEING.
 TEXAS TECH IS ACTUALLY PRETTY
 FUN TO WATCH.
 THEY ARE WELL COACHED.
 THE BALL MOVES AND THEY PLAY
 GOOD DEFENSE.
 VIRGINIA, I WOULD RATHER DRAWN
 MYSELF, BUT THEY HAVE A PRETTY
 GOOD GAME.
 AUBURN CAN GET UP AND DOWN THE
 FLOOR.
 MICHIGAN STATE, IF THERE IS ONE
 PLAYER WE POINT TO, IT IS THEY
 HAVE IN CASSIUS WINSTON.
 IF YOU STUMBLE UPON THESE
 GAMES.
 I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET
 VERY GOOD BASKETBALL.
 BUT UNLESS YOU STUMBLE ACROSS
 IT, YOU DON'T HAVE A REASON TO
 GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO SEE THIS,
 IF YOU ARE NOT A BIG COLLEGE
 BASKETBALL FAN.
 PABLO: YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU
 WOULD RATHER DROWN YOURSELF
 THAN WATCHING THEM.
 VIRGINIA PLAYS BASKETBALL LIKE
 THEY ARE TRYING TO DROWN
 THEMSELVES AND THEIR OPPONENT.
 IN TERMS OF TEMPO THEY ARE
 353RD IN THE COUNT.
 BOMANI: OUT OF HOME?
 PABLO: I DON'T KNOW.
 BOMANI: 353.
 PABLO: THAT MAKES SENSE.
 TEXAS TECH IS EXCELLENT.
 THEY HAVE IN JARRETT CULVER
 POTENTIALLY A TOP FIVE PICK.
 THEY HAVE A DEFENSE.
 IN THE DATABASE, THEY ARE THE
 BEST DEFENSE HE HAS EVER SEEN.
 NOW WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR THE
 GENERAL AUDIENCE?
 WHAT DOES IT DO WHEN MICHIGAN
 STATE IS OUT THERE AND TOM IZZO
 IS THE BIGGEST NAME, AND BRUCE
 PEARL IS OUT THERE, AND HE IS
 THE BIGGEST NAME FOR AUBURN.
 WHAT IF AUBURN WINS THIS?
 THAT IS KIND OF WHAT I AM
 ROOTING FOR PURELY FOR THE
 SIGHT OF MARK EMMERT HANDING
 SOME SOME TROPHY TO THAT GIO.
 BOMANI: AND ME GOING OWE WAS,
 BRUCE PEARL.
 IT IS HARD FOR ME TO FIND NICE
 THINGS TO SAY.
 CAN WE TALK ABOUT ZION?
 WE DID HAVE THE OPTION OF
 TALKING ABOUT OTHER GUYS.
 WE JUST NEVER DID.
 WE HAD ONE GUY, AND WE LIKED
 IT.
 THAT IS WHY WE DON'T KNOW WHO
 THE HELL ANYBODY ELSE IS
 COLLEGE BASKETBALL.
 BASEBALL WE HAVE NEVER BEEN SO
 UNINTERESTED IN OTHER THAN
 PEOPLE.
 OUR LAST NAME, MUFFET MCGRAW.
 SHE SAID SHE HAS NO PLANS TO
 HIRE A MALE COACH AT ANY POINT
 IN THE FUTURE.
 YESTERDAY, MCGRAW WAS ASKED
 ABOUT THIS AT THE FINAL FOUR.
 LET'S LISTEN TO HER.
 THIS IS A PATH FOR YOU TO
 TAKE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE
 IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE 50% OF
 WOMEN IN POWER, WE HAVE LIGHT
 -RIGHT NOW LESS THAN 5% OF
 WOMEN ARE C.E.O.'S OF FORTUNE
 500 COMPANIES.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT MEN'S
 BASKETBALL, AND THE 989% OF THE
 JOBS GO TO MEN.
 WHY SHOULDN'T 99% OR 100% OF
 THE WOMEN'S JOBS GO TO WOMEN?
 MAYBE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE 10
 ATHLETIC DIRECTORS IN
 TELEVISION DIVISION I.
 PEOPLE HIRE PEOPLE WHO LOOK
 LIKE THEM, AND THAT IS THE
 PROBLEM.
 PABLO: BO, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
 THAT?
 BOMANI: THAT LAST POINT, I
 DON'T THINK IT IS THAT AS MUCH
 AS THEY HIRE ON PEOPLE WHO THEY
 THINK IS BETTER ON SUPERFICIAL
 TERMS.
 YOU SEE IT IN AFRICAN SOCCER.
 ALL THOSE AFRICAN TEAMS HIRE
 WHITE COACHES.
 THEY ARE SUBSCRIBING LAZYLY TO
 THE IDEA THAT THE PRIVILEGED
 CLASS IS BETTER AT THIS JOB
 THAN OTHERS.
 IT IS HARD TO ARGUE WITH WHAT
 SHE SAID.
 YOU SEE FINAL FOUR, FINAL FOUR,
 FINAL FOUR, AND OVER AND OVER
 AGAIN HERE.
 UNLESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
 SOMEBODY NOT HIRING QUALIFIED
 PEOPLE, THEN THERE IS NOTHING
 REALLY TO BE MAD AT.
 INSTEAD, TAKE HOLD OF THE
 NUMBERS SHE WAS GIVING THERE.
 DAN LE BATARD WAS TALKING
 BETWEEN.
 WHEN EDDIE MURPHY DID HIS
 MOVIES, HE HAD BLACK PEOPLE
 HOLDING CAMERAS AND EVERYTHING
 ELSE.
 NOBODY ELSE WAS GOING TO BE ONE
 TO DO.
 SHE HAS DECIDED THAT, AND I
 DON'T BLAME HER ABOUT IT.
 PABLO: THERE IS A COUNTER
 ARGUMENT BASED IN THE IDEA THAT
 THIS JUST MEANS YOU ARE GOING
 TO HIGH ANYBODY BUT A WHITE
 MAN, AND DOESN'T THAT CALL INTO
 QUESTION CERTAIN THINGS LIKE
 ILLEGAL HIRING?
 IT IS DISCRIMINATORY.
 IT IS ILLEGAL WHAT MUFFET
 MCGRAW SAID, BUT WHEN YOU TAKE
 IT IN CONTEXT, AN ENTERTAINER
 SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO HIRE A
 WHITE LEAD FOR HIS MOVIES
 BECAUSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
 THAT HAS EMERGED IS A LANDSCAPE
 THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN EQUALITY
 OF OUTCOME.
 IT IS SHAKING OUT WHERE IN
 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL, THE WOMEN
 HAVE A CERTAIN PRESENCE, AND IN
 MEN'S BASKETBALL, THEY HAVE
 NEXT TO NONE.
 WHAT DO THE WOMEN DO IF NOT
 FENLED FOR THEMSELVES?
 BOMANI: RIGHT.
 THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU WIN HOW
 SHE HAS WON.
 YOU GET A MEASURE OF PEOPLE TO
 BE OIBLE TO DO THESE SORTS OF
 THINGS.
 I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN MAKE
 AN ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS OUT OF
 MALICE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
 THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF OF
 SCRAME NATURING AGAINST MEN
 NEARLY AS MUCH AS IT IS
 EMPOWERING WOMEN.
 THE FLIP SIDE, WHAT IF SOMEBODY
 SAID I WOULD NEVER HIRE THIS
 PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE, THEY
 ARE PROBABLY NOT ON THE NAME OF
 HIRING ANYBODY.
 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A LOGICAL
 BASIS FOR WHAT SHE IS TALKING
 ABOUT.
 PABLO: STANFORD'S COACH SAID IT
 WOULD BE NICE IF MEN AND WICK
 DO WORK TOGETHER.
 BO COMING UP NEXT,
 DRAYMOND THROWS SOME SHADE AT
 CHRIS ANDERSEN.
 WE ARE GUESS MESSY.

 HE GOT A BAD EGG. HE A REAL BAD EGG HE GOT.
 DAN: LEBRON IS A BAD EGG.
 YOU WILL NOT HEAR THAT ANALYSIS
 ANYWHERE.
 K GOD FOR THAT BECAUSE IT
 IS TERRIBLE.
 GREETINGS, EARTH LYNX.
 HIGH NOON IS BEAMED TO YOU FROM
 ABOVE THE HEINEKEN RIVER DECK
 AT PIER 17.
 BOMANI: LAST NIGHT, WARRIORS
 SMOKED THE LAKERS.
 HERE IS KEVIN DURANT AND LEBRON
 GETTING THEIR CASINO ON.
 PABLO: THEY ARE JUST DOING THIS
 TO TROLL.
 THEY ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING OF
 VALUE.
 BOMANI: THAT IS WHY BRIAN SHAW
 IS OVER THERE LAUGHING.
 THEY ARE LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO
 EAT THIS UP.
 WE WOULD READ THEIR LIMBS IF
 THEY WEREN'T COVERING THEIRS
 MOUTH.
 BOMANI: I WAS TRYING.
 QUOTE, TO MANY PEOPLE MAKE A
 MISTAKE TRYING TO MIMIC LEBRON
 WITH A TWIST, AND THAT TWIST
 COMPLETELY BLEEP THE IDEA UP.
 SODERLING DRAYMOND GREEN.
 LET'S HEAR WHAT ELSE HE HAD TO
 SAY.
 A BLUEPRINT FOR GUYS LIKE
 MYSELF AND EVERYBODY.
 LIKE HE LAID THE BLUEPRINT OUT.
 I THINK SO MANY PEOPLE ARE
 AFRAID TO SAY THEY TRY TO
 FOLLOW IT.
 SO MANY PEOPLE MAKE A MISTAKE
 TRYING TO LIKE MIMIC WHAT BRON
 AND YOURSELF, AND MCFADDEN, AND
 RICH, AND RANDY, AND ALL AVILAN
 HAVE ACCOMPLISH -AND ALL
 Y'ALL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED.
 PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES TRYING TO
 MIMIC IT WITH A TWIST.
 OH, YEAH WE ARE GOING TO DO
 THAT THAT THEY DID, AND WE ARE
 GOING TO ADD THAT TWIST TO SAY
 IT IS OUR IDEA.
 AND THAT TWIST COMPLETELY
 [BEEP]S IT UP.
 IT WORKED.
 BOMANI: PABLO, IF YOU WERE
 KEVIN DURANT, WU THINK HE WAS
 TALKING ABOUT YOU?
 PABLO: I WOULDN'T BLAME KEVIN
 DURANT FOR THINKING THAT, BO,
 BECAUSE LEBRON JAMES HAS A SHOT
 CALLED THE SHOP ON HBO.
 KEVIN DURANT HAS A SHOW ON
 ESPN+.
 LEBRON JAMES HAS A BUNCH OF
 FRIENDS THAT HE TRUSTS.
 KEVIN DURANT HAS ONE RICH, WHO
 IS HIS GUY.
 YOU YOU GO DOWN THE LIST IN
 TERMS OF HOW THEY MADE THEIR
 ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND CARRIED
 THEMSELVES.
 IT IS SUBTWEETING.
 BOMANI: YOU ARE CALLING HIM
 KEVIN MCDOWELL.
 HE IS BASICALLY SAYING OUR BUNS
 HAVE NO MEAT.
 SOMEBODY PUTS THIS UP ON THE
 INTERNET, AND ALL THE THINGS
 THAT LEBRON HAS DONE, THERE ARE
 DIRECT SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE
 WAY KEVIN DURANT IS TRYING TO
 HANDLE HIS BUSINESS AND THE WAY
 THAT LEBRON JAMES IS TRYING TO
 HANDLE HIS BUSINESS.
 THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
 NOW THIS WAS RECORD ADD WHILE
 AGO AS WE UNDERSTAND IT.
 WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS JUST
 WHAT WAS THE DRAYMOND-KEVIN
 DURANT SITUATION AT THAT TIME?
 HE KNEW WHAT THIS SOUNDED LIKE.
 HE HAD SOMEBODY IN MIND.
 PABLO: YES.
 BUT DRAYMOND GREEN, IT SHOULD
 BE NOTED, IF YOU MAKE A DEFENSE
 OF HIM SAYING THIS INNOCENTLY,
 HE IS LIVING THE WORDS HE IS
 SAYING.
 HE SIGNED WITH YOU CLUTCH.
 I HAVE SEEN DRAYMOND GREEN,
 MAVERICK CARTER AND PAUL RIVERA
 HANG OUT IN A HOTEL ROOM
 TOGETHER IN VEGAS.
 DRAYMOND BELIEVES WHAT HE IS
 SAYING, BUT IS HE ALSO SHADING
 A LITTLE BIT?
 NEXT QUOTE.
 SYLVIA HATCHELL IS UNDER
 INVESTIGATION THAT SHE MADE A
 SERIOUS OF RACIAL REMARKS,
 INCLUDING THE PLAYERS WOULD GET
 HANGED FROM TREES IF THEIR PLAY
 DIDN'T IMPROVE.
 REPORTS THE WASHINGTON POST.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE
 ALLEGATIONS.
 BOMANI: THAT POST STORY IS
 CRAZY.
 HATCHELL HAS BEEN PUT ON
 ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE.
 BOTTOM LINE, THEY ARE READING
 OVER THAT CONTRACT.
 THERE AIN'T NO COMING BACK FROM
 WHEN THIS COMES OUT.
 THEY HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT
 THAT THE PARENT GOT TOGETHER TO
 PROTECT THE DAUGHTERS.
 WHAT I MAKE OF THIS AS I HEAR
 IT, GENO AURIEMMA, REMEMBER
 WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THAT, HE
 SAID ALL THESE COACHES ARE
 AFRAID TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE
 PLAYERS.
 THESE KIDS STUCK AROUND IN THE
 MIDST OF THE MADNESS, AND
 THEMSELVES COACHING ARE SCARED.
 WHAT ARE THEY SCARED OF?
 PABLO: WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON
 THE MEDICAL SO SIDE OF THIS
 THING.
 THERE WAS A CONTROVERSY THAT
 SYLVIA HATCHELL AND THE TEAM
 DOCTOR, WHO IS TO BLAME MOST,
 BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
 PLAYERS PLAYING THROUGH
 SHOULDER INJURIES, CONCUSSIONS,
 KNEE INJURIES, STUFF THAT GOT
 EXACERBATED BECAUSE THEY WERE
 BEING TO PLAY THROUGH IT.
 WHAT DID THOSE PLAYERS DO?
 THEY PLAYED THROUGH IT.
 BECAUSE THE POWER IMBALANCE
 REALLY IS IN FAVOR OF THE
 PEYTON MANNINGER RATHER THAN
 THE UNPAID LABOR.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO SCARE OTHER
 PLAYERS STRAIGHT?
 NOTICE.
 DEAL WITH IT ON EITHER TERMS.
 BOMANI: THERE IS ANOTHER PART
 WORTH NOTING HERE.
 I UNDERSTAND THAT NORTH
 CAROLINA WON THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP IN 1994.
 I UNDERSTAND THAT SYLVIA
 HATCHELL A HALL OF FAMER.
 I HAVE WATCHED ENOUGH NORTH
 CAROLINA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TO
 TELL YOU SHE IS IMMINENTLY
 REPLACEABLE.
 PABLO: I WOULD HOPE SO.
 BOMANI: WE ARE GOING TO GET
 BETTER AS FAR AS PERSONNEL.
 THERE IS A LOT OF TALENT OUT
 THERE AND A LOT OF TALENT THAT
 CAN HELP OUR FRANCHISE.
 SO I WILL BE AS ACTIVE AS I
 NEED TO BE.
 SAID LEBRON JAMES.
 DOES THIS SOIMED LIKE A SHOT AT
 MAGIC JOHNSON TO YOU?
 PABLO: IT SOUNDS LIKE A WAKE-UP
 CALL.
 THE REASON THEY GOT THE JOBS IN
 THE FIRST PLACE, NOT BECAUSE
 THEY ARE GOOD AT SALARY CAP
 MANAGEMENT OR TEAM
 CONSTRUCTION, THEY GOT THE JOB
 BECAUSE ONE IS A MASTER AREA OF
 DEALING WITH TALENT, AND THE
 OTHER IS TO GET FREE AGENTS.
 THEIR JOB IS FREE AGENT
 ACQUISITION.
 LEBRON IS SAYING WHY ARE YOU
 GUYS MAYBE HERE?
 BOMANI: TO BE HERE, THEY DID
 GET ONE FREE AGENT THAT WAS A
 PRETTY BIG DEAL.
 THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE JOB THAT
 LONG.
 THIS IS NOT A SHOT AT MAGIC
 BECAUSE THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT
 MAGIC HIMSELF WOULD SAY.
 MAGIC HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT THIS
 IS THE YEAR THAT THEY HAVE TO
 BRING PEOPLE IN.
 THE THING THAT GETS ME ABOUT
 IT, IT IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE
 ABOUT YOU BEING ACTIVE IN
 RECRUITING, LEBRON.
 IT IS ABOUT YOU CREATING A
 SITUATION THAT MAKES PEOPLE
 WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU.
 THERE ARE REAL QUESTIONS AS TO
 WHETHER ANOTHER STAR WANTS TO
 BE IN LEBRON'S ORBIT WHEN
 EVERYTHING IS ABOUT LEBRON IF
 YOU WIN, AND ABOUT YOU IF YOU
 LOSE.
 WHAT CAN THEY DO TO MITT GAME
 THERE?
 PABLO: WE HAVE A KEVIN DURANT,
 KAWHI LEONARD, KYRIE IRVING.
 WHO WILL WANT TO JOHN?
 FROM THAT LIST?
 MAYBE KEMBA WALKER.
 PABLO: THE LAKERS SHOULD BE
 ABLE TO SELL THIS, BUT WE ARE
 NOT SURE ABOUT.
 THAT
 PABLO: NO.
 BOMANI: COMING UP.
 MIGHT ZION GET
 BOMANI: COMING UP. MIGHT ZION GET     CLASSIC SURRENDER COBRA.

 BOMANI: THE JETS GOT OFF THE
 CLASSIC UNIFORM LOOK.
 THEY DECIDED TO GET THEMSELVES
 SOME NEW UNIFORMS.
 PABLO: OH, NO.
 THIS IS LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE TO
 DO WHEN YOU CAN'T USE THE NFL
 LOGOS IN MOVIES.
 BOMANI: YES.
 THEY LOOK LIKE THE NEW YORK
 747'S, UNIFORM PAID FOR BY

 BOMANI: THIS IS TERRIBLE.
 WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
 WHY?
 BOMANI: THEY ARE THE JETS.
 PABLO: TODAY'S NUMBER, $10
 MILLION.
 HOW MUCH NICK SAYS ONE UNNAMED
 SHOE COMPANY IS IT WILLING TO
 OFFER ZION WILLIAMSON PER YEAR.
 ARE YOU SURPRISED AT THAT?
 BOMANI: WELL, LEBRON SIGNED HIS
 LEGAL IN 2003, AND IT WAS
 CLOSER TO $12 MILLION A YEAR.
 THE ECONOMICS OF SHOES HAVE
 CHANGED, AND GUYS REALLY AREN'T
 GETTING THAT BIG MONEY.
 BUT THIS IS THAT DUDE.
 THIS IS THE SINGLE NAME TYPE
 STAR.
 I EXPECT HIM TO BE THIS THAT

 COULD DO THIS AGAINST PEOPLE

 YOU WOULD BE IN THE GAMES, BUT
 NOT THE SAME.

 DESPERATELY NEED.
