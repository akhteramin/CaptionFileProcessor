 with Kelly and Ryan." Today we catch up with
 Kate Hudson,
 and "Mr. Worldwide,"
 Pitbull.
 Plus straight from the
 big screen, actor Winston Duke,
 and a performance
 from Daughtry,
 all next on "Live."
 [Dua Lipa's "Electricity" plays]
 And now, here are
 Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest.

 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: Hello!
 Kelly: Yep, yep, yep.
 Now I'm ready.
 Ryan: Good morning.
 [cheers and applause]
 Good morning.
 [music continues]

 [cheers and applause]

 I like that one.
 "Electricity," right?
 A little Dua Lipa there
 in the game.
 Kelly: Hey, it is Wednesday,
 July 3, 2019.
 It is my dad's birthday today!
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: Happy birthday,
 Joe Ripa.
 Kelly: Happy birthday,
 Joe Ripa.
 It's a big one.
 I'm not gonna blow up your age.
 Ryan: Does he have a
 traditional celebration?
 Kelly: Well, you know, every
 year, he likes to say that they
 do fireworks and they have a big
 cookout, but I'm like, "That's
 pretty much everybody."
 Ryan: "You know,
 that was for me.
 That was for me,
 that whole thing up in the sky."
 Well, my greatest memory of your
 father is he and I laying on a
 chaise lounge in the Bahamas
 together with him giving me life
 advice and guidance and asking
 if I wanted representation by
 him to negotiate my next deal.
 [laughter]
 He was gonna be my union member.
 Kelly: It was the sweet--
 he was--
 Gelman: Joe was trying
 to unionize.
 Kelly: It was--he was--
 to unionize us.
 He was telling us that we needed
 to unionize.
 And I said, "We are in a union,
 Dad.
 We--believe it or not,
 we are in a union."
 Ryan: I felt like he accepted
 me in that moment.
 Kelly: He really did.
 The two of you were so--
 Ryan: Right?
 Kelly: I have pictures of
 that, and they're some of my
 favorite memories, because you
 two are so funny together,
 the two of you.
 Because you take on my dad's
 personality when you talk
 to my dad.
 So--you--yeah.
 Ryan: I became--
 I became stern.
 Kelly: Yeah.
 Ryan: I became--
 my voice got deeper.
 Kelly: Yeah.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: I find when I talk to,
 like, athletes too,
 I do the same thing.
 Kelly: Right.
 Ryan: Like, I--
 So how was the game?
 Kelly: Yeah.
 [laughter]
 And you always say to my dad,
 "Joe Ripa."
 Ryan: "Joe Ripa."
 Kelly: Yeah, it's like you
 puff up and then you're like,
 "Joe"--
 You call him both names...
 Ryan: "Joe Ripa."
 Kelly: Which most people do.
 Most people call me both names.
 Ryan: Kelly Ripa.
 Yeah, well, it's like one--
 I mean, come on.
 You--Kelly Ripa.
 "There's Kelly Ripa.
 There's Kelly Ripa.
 Kelly Ripa from the park."
 Kelly: But I mean, before
 this show, I'm going back
 to high school.
 Ryan: Kirripa.
 Kelly: I was both names.
 Ryan: Kirripa.
 Kelly: Well--
 Ryan: Kirripa.
 Kelly: Well, you're--
 [laughter]
 Ryan: I'm--listen. If your--
 Kelly: You're making me
 more of a sound than--
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Well, happy
 Fourth of July, Kirripa.
 Kelly: Thank you.
 [chirps]
 Ryan: I was reading this
 about, you know--
 thank you for tuning in
 in the morning.
 I don't know what your morning
 routines are,
 your morning habits are.
 But there's a whole article on
 surprising morning habits that
 can give you more anxiety.
 And just by reading it,
 I got more anxiety.
 Kelly: Right, of course.
 Just
 you saying the word "anxiety"...
 Ryan: Gives you--
 Kelly: Gave me anxiety.
 Ryan: Cortisol's releasing
 right now, isn't it?
 Kelly: Right now, yeah.
 Ryan: Is cortisol releasing
 into your system?
 Kelly: Yeah.
 Ryan: Let it out.
 Kelly: That's why I stopped
 wearing pants with a zipper.
 [laughter]
 Yeah, can't do it.
 Ryan: That's the reason.
 Kelly: That's the reason.
 I can't do it.
 I can't work in live TV and
 have a waistband.
 [laughter]
 No waist anymore.
 I'm like, "Forget it.
 The cortisol spikes, it's not
 gonna affect me, 'cause my dress
 is just gonna widen."
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Do you jump--they say
 it's bad for you to jump
 right out of bed.
 Like, to get right out of bed
 is bad.
 It causes a spike
 in all of that.
 Kelly: Well...
 Ryan: Do you jump right out
 or do you lay there for--
 I lay there and moan
 for a minute.
 [laughter]
 Kelly: I usually set Snooze.
 I do one snooze.
 But--
 Ryan: I find it to be
 painful.
 Kelly: The snooze?
 Ryan: Yeah.
 'Cause I know it's coming, and
 I can't--you know,
 it's like that anxiety.
 Kelly: But I like that.
 It's like, I hit Snooze, but
 the whole time I'm quasi-awake
 knowing that--
 Ryan: It's coming.
 But, see, that gives me anxiety,
 knowing it's coming.
 Kelly: I just burped, and
 that gave me anxiety.
 Ryan: By the way...
 [laughter]
 Can I say, that garlic
 smells great.
 Kelly: Oh, no, it's not.
 It's not garlic.
 Ryan: No, I know.
 You to--I know it's not garlic.
 Let's see.
 Doing household chores
 gives you anxiety, so quit.
 Kelly: Wait, that gives you
 anxiety: Household chores?
 Gelman: Well, knowing you--
 Ryan: At the start of your
 day--at the start of--this is
 all at the beginning of the day.
 Kelly: Oh, they're saying,
 don't do it at the start
 of the day.
 Ryan: Yeah, don't do it at
 the beginning of the day.
 Don't look at your work email
 the second you get out of bed.
 Don't look at your to-do list.
 Don't skip breakfast.
 Kelly: [groans]
 I mean, I do--I do all of that.
 Ryan: I know. I know.
 Kelly: I do every--
 Ryan: But you get to wear
 a dress, and it's all fine.
 Kelly: Well, I mean, they
 make it look fine.
 I liken myself to
 a Westminster show dog.
 [laughter]
 Yeah, it looks very fluffy on
 the outside, but on the inside,
 it's like, "Is this done yet?
 Are we over?"
 [laughter]
 "Can we just--can you please
 put me back in my cage?"
 [laughter]
 "I just--I don't want to--
 I don't wa tbere
 the judges right now."
 [laughter]
 Ryan: I do find looking at
 the phone--I try not to do it
 first thing,
 which is hard sometimes.
 Because you're turning off your
 alarm and then--
 Kelly: I have to look at it,
 because usually he's either
 texted me or you've texted me
 over some thing that's happened
 in the middle of the night.
 Ryan: Some inane thing.
 Kelly: Yeah, some thing
 that has happened.
 So I have to check it first
 thing in the morning.
 Um, you know, it's not just my
 dad's birthday today, okay?
 I want you to know it's also
 another national holiday.
 Ryan: What is it?
 Gelman: A special day.
 Kelly: And I believe it could
 become an international holiday
 if we get it trending here.
 It is national compliment
 your mirror day.
 Gelman: Oh, my goodness.
 [cheers and applause]
 Yes.

 [cheers and applause]
 Lady in the front row is like,
 "No, it is not."
 Like, "Oh, yes, it is."
 You want to know how it works?
 Watch this.
 Gelman: Okay.
 Kelly: Okay, you--
 you hold this.
 Ryan: I'm not complimenting
 a picture of me.
 Kelly: Hold--hold it.
 Gelman: Just come on.
 Kelly: Gelman, do you want
 to do it too,
 and I'll read?
 Gelman: Sure, I can do it.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: You stand next to
 Ryan; I want to see--
 Ryan: Gelman celebrates this
 every day.
 Kelly: Oh, I know.
 Trust me, I know.
 Gelman: Yeah.
 Kelly: Here's what you do,
 everybody.
 Stand in front of your mirror
 with your eyes closed.
 That's the key.
 Ryan: That's the key.
 Kelly: Close your eyes.
 Ryan: Turn the lights off.
 Kelly: Yeah.
 [clears throat]
 Put a big smile on your face.
 Eyes closed.
 Big smile.
 Now, open your eyes.
 Ryan: No.
 [laughter]
 I don't want to see it. No.
 Kelly: Isn't the picture of
 the person in the mirror
 absolutely stunning?
 Gelman: Oh, yes.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Who's making love to
 themself over here?
 What?
 [laughter]
 What is going on?
 Kelly: Don't make the special
 holiday be over--overshadowed
 by the Fourth of July.
 Gelman: No.
 I'm feeling very positive.
 Ryan: I have to tell you, I--
 Kelly: Make sure you
 compliment your mirror for
 displaying the beautiful
 person--
 Ryan: Oh, gag.
 Gelman: Thank you, mirror.
 [laughter]
 What a great mirror you are.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Gag, gag, gag.
 Gelman: You're my favorite
 mirror.
 You're a good mirror.
 Kelly: Okay, Gelman.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Goodbye.
 Kelly: Thank you, Gelman.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: I was reading this
 article about smartphones
 at the gym.
 I guess, you know, a lot of--if
 you go to the gym and work out,
 the gyms want you to post that
 you're working out at the gym
 because they get good free
 publicity and marketing.
 Kelly: Well, especially your
 gym where all the models go.
 [cheers]
 Kelly: It looks like a
 Victoria's Secrets shoot every
 time--I'm like, "Oh, there's
 Ryan at his gym again."
 Ryan: Hey, look.
 It's the only gym that has
 enough weight for me, so--
 [laughter]
 Gelman: Three-pounders?
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Yeah, I have the little
 pink ones you hold.
 [laughter]
 Kelly: They sha--
 they make sounds.
 Ryan: Yeah, they make
 shaker sounds.
 Kelly: They make sounds.
 Ryan: It's got some
 Daddy Yankee music.
 Gelman: Yeah.
 Ryan: But this article is
 about a gym etiquette.
 They say don't FaceTime or Skype
 in front of other people.
 No photos in the locker room.
 Gelman: No, yeah, no.
 Ryan: No.
 [laughter]
 Wait until after a class to ask
 the instructor for the selfie.
 Now, what I find people do
 in the gym is, they take their
 phone and they set it up, like,
 over here, you know?
 And they go over here
 to do curls.
 And then you walk through their
 shot, and--[gasps]
 [laughter]
 Kelly: Yeah, well,
 guess what.
 Guess what.
 That's exactly their problem,
 not your problem.
 Ryan: Yeah, exactly.
 Kelly: Because that is a--
 that's--the floor--this is
 gonna sound like a shock
 to all the millennials.
 The floor is for walking.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Well, the good--
 Kelly: It's not an imaginary
 tripod for you to lean your cell
 phone so you can have a selfie
 so you can remember so you can
 be nostalgic in real time.
 Right?
 Ryan: Listen.
 These are the people that are
 celebrating the mirror day all
 day today, so they won't be
 at the gym.
 Kelly: That's right.
 That's right.
 They're taking the day off.
 Ryan: They're taking
 the day off to just celebrate
 themselves again.
 Kelly: Yes, that's true.
 Ryan: Shall we?
 Kelly: Um, sure,
 we could do that.
 I mean, I do have my study out
 on insomnia.
 Gelman: Oh.
 Ryan: Do it.
 Kelly: You want to know why
 we're so--why we're such
 insomniacs?
 Ryan: Why are we such
 insomniacs?
 Kelly: Embarrassing thoughts
 keep us awake at night.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: I think just thoughts.
 Like--like a sum of all
 thoughts keep me awake.
 Kelly: Well, that's what
 I said.
 Ryan: Everything happens.
 Kelly: Thoughts keep me
 awake at night,
 not necessarily embarrassing
 thoughts.
 Ryan: Just the--a flow.
 Kelly: I am a human
 experiment that you cannot die
 from embarrassment.
 Ryan: You are--
 that's correct.
 Kelly: I'm still here.
 Ryan: You are good on that.
 Kelly: Right.
 So--but they are saying that,
 like, daily blunders can creep
 into the margins of our brain,
 and so we fall asleep but
 suddenly the thought of
 something mortifying that
 happened during the day
 creeps in and--
 Ryan: It does.
 Kelly: Right.
 Ryan: It does, but that is
 like--there's 40 other thoughts
 happening at the same time.
 Kelly: Right.
 Ryan: So one by one, shh!
 I try and quiet them.
 Kelly: Right.
 Ryan: Shh.
 Then the alarm goes off.
 It's morning; I still--
 [laughter]
 I'm still trying to quiet them.
 Kelly: You're trying
 to quiet the--
 Ryan: I'm trying to quiet--
 you know, I mean, I try
 to quiet the thoughts.
 Hard to do sometimes.
 Kelly: I always worry that
 I've hurt somebody's feelings,
 and that creeps back to me.
 You know, like--you know
 my sense of humor.
 Sometimes I'll, like--
 Ryan: Yeah.
 Kelly: I'll use some of my
 best stuff on people
 I don't know that well,
 and they're like--
 Ryan: Right, and they take--
 Kelly: And I go, "No,
 I'm kidding.
 See, that's my"--
 Ryan: "That's my
 personality."
 [laughter]
 Kelly: And then that creeps
 in at night.
 I go, "Oh, I don't think
 so-and-so got my humor
 at the funeral today."
 [laughter]
 Right?
 [laughter]
 Ryan: No, I've never
 had that happen.
 Today on the show?
 Gelman: Yeah, we--
 Ryan: Kate Hudson is here.
 Ready for Kate Hudson?
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: Pitbull is also here.
 Ryan: Winston Duke is here.
 Kelly: Yeah, and a
 performance by Daughtry.
 Ryan: Now, tomorrow's the
 Fourth of July, and all week
 long, we're playing a special
 audience edition of Stump the
 Hosts where an audience member
 shares a summer-themed truth
 or lie and we have to figure out
 which one is true.
 Kelly: Yeah, if they stump
 us, they get a "Kelly and Ryan"
 mug and a $1,200 appliance
 package from Cuisinart.
 That's right.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: All right?
 Kelly: So far this week,
 we have not--that's right--
 not been stumped.
 But the week is...
 Gelman: It's still young.
 Ryan: The week is young.
 Kelly: Still young.
 Ryan: Cover your mug, Kelly.
 Kelly: All right.
 Ryan: It's time for Stump
 the Hosts: Audience Edition.

 Kelly: Yeah, that's right.
 Let's meet our participant from
 Knoxville, Tennessee.
 Where is Kristy Bruce?
 [cheers and applause]
 Hi. Ryan: Hi, Kristy.
 Kelly: Hi, adorable.
 Hey, girl.
 Kelly: How you doing?
 Hi.
 Ryan: Hi!
 Kelly: Hi!
 Ryan: How you doing?
 I'm great.
 How are you doing?
 Ryan: It's a pleasure.

 Kristy Bruce, you have an
 absolute joyful, joyful
 sunshine face.
 Oh, thank you.
 Kelly: You really do.
 [cheers and applause]
 You have a smile
 that makes me smile.
 Oh, well, good. I'm glad.
 Kelly: Yeah, that's good.
 So you should win bonus points.
 Ryan: We hope so.
 Yes, yes. Bonus points, yes.
 Kelly: Just for that.
 Ryan: So you're gonna give us
 two statements.
 Okay.
 Ryan: All right?
 We're gonna try and guess
 which is true.
 If you stump us, you win.
 Okay. All right, this is gonna
 be hard.
 Both: Okay.
 All right, here we go.
 The first lie--
 or no, the first truth or lie
 is, um...
 Growing up, we had a houseboat,
 on Norris Lake in Knoxville,
 Tennessee, and my family had
 a boat, and we would all ski.
 We would all do it--
 there were four of us,
 sometimes five.
 We would all line up and we
 would do pyramids.
 Kelly: Behind the houseboat.
 Behind the house--
 well, not the houseboat, 'cause
 we had a boat, but we kind of
 just--
 Ryan: So you had a houseboat
 and a ski boat.
 Right.
 So we would--we would go out
 and we would ski out and
 sometimes we would compete.
 We were the McMichaels.
 We would travel and do
 local competitions.
 Ryan: All right,
 what's the second one?
 Then we'll start
 asking questions.
 The second one is, I was
 Miss Tiny Tot of Tennessee.
 Kelly: [gasps]
 And on Fourth of July,
 I would do the Fourth of July
 parade and sit on the
 convertible and wave
 to the crowd.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: Okay, let me see
 your parade wave.
 Well, it was bad,
 because my mom told me--
 you know, I would wave like
 this, you know, to everybody.
 They were like, "No, no, no.
 You've got to--
 you gotta give it.
 You know, you gotta
 give it good."
 Kelly: And how old were you
 when you were Miss Tiny Tot?
 I was seven.
 Kelly: Seven.
 Ryan: Is Miss Tiny Tot...
 Kelly: I don't care.
 I wantnt her to be Miss Tiny To,
 because--
 [laughter]
 I'm like, you're Miss Tiny Tot
 of this show.
 Ryan: Is there a Miss
 Tiny Tot circuit out there?
 Miss Tiny Tot.
 Kelly: It's very rare that I
 am bigger than somebody.
 Both: Yes.
 Ryan: What does the audience
 think?
 What does the audience have to
 say about this?
 Oh, wow.
 Kelly: Oh, wow.
 Ryan: I mean, they really
 believe you have all those
 boats.
 Kelly: But I want her to be
 Miss--
 Oh!
 What is going on right now?
 Ryan: It's staying 80/20.
 Kelly: I wanna believe that--
 Ryan: Do you want to go
 with it, Kel?
 Gelman: Go with what you--
 Ryan: You know, it's your
 father's birthday.
 Gelman: All right.
 Ryan: You go with
 what you want.
 Uh-uh.
 Kelly: She--
 [laughter]
 I'm not gonna say a word.
 Kelly: Um...
 All right, let's just say that
 I'll go with the audience and
 say that she was part of a
 waterskiing troop.
 Ryan: Is that true?
 No.
 I was Miss Tiny Tot
 of Tennessee.
 [cheers and applause]
 You wanted me to be Miss
 Tiny Tot, and I was!
 [cheers and applause]
 I was Miss Leprechaun too.
 Kelly: I--you were?
 Oh, yeah, I had multiple
 titles.
 Ryan: You are amazing.
 Kelly: She's a multiple
 title winner!
 Gelman: Jeez.
 Ryan: She's going down in
 history, ladies and gentlemen.
 Kelly: All right, so now you
 help a member of our studio
 audience receive a $500 gift
 card from Club Monaco.
 Ryan: All right,
 so get out your tickets.
 Can I pick one of my friends?
 Kelly: Yeah, you pick--
 Uh, you can--if you can find
 their number, you can pick one
 of your friends.
 Okay.
 Gelman: No looking.
 I'm looking.
 I'm looking, Christy Vining.
 I'm looking.
 I'm just kidding.
 Uh, let's see here.

 Ryan: 125.

 There you go.
 Kelly: All right.
 Ryan: Right over there in
 the corner.
 That was so fun.
 Ryan: Kristy, so nice to meet
 you.
 You too.
 You're a blast.
 Ryan: We'll be right back
 with Kate Hudson.
 [cheers and applause]
 Announcer: Still ahead on
 "Live," a performance by Daughtry,
 actor Winston Duke, Pitbull,
 and coming up next, Kate Hudson.
 Kelly: She's a successful actress, a bestselling author,
 a clothing entrepreneur,
 and one of the most lovable
 people we know.
 Please welcome back to the show
 Kate Hudson.
 [cheers and applause]
 [upbeat music]

 Ryan: Good to see you. Good to see you.
 Thanks!
 Kelly: It's so funny.
 I saw that dress hanging
 backstage, and I was like--
 Yes!
 Kelly: I was like,
 "Oh, my gosh."
 I made it.
 Kelly: I thought that was
 for me.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: She can get you one.
 I'll get you one.
 Kelly: It is very cute.
 It's made out of
 organic cotton.
 Kelly: No kidding.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: So pretty.
 Ah, I'm excited
 to talk about it.
 But first I want to say that I--
 I would--you took my job.
 I would love to be in a bikini
 pointing at cars.
 Ryan: Oh, really?
 Kelly: Well, you could be.
 I love a fast car.
 Kelly: Listen.
 And I love a bikini.
 Ryan: Do you--hey.
 Do you remember the Whitesnake
 video where they were
 dancing on the--
 Yes.
 Kelly: Yeah, of course.
 Ryan: That could be us
 on the hood.
 Totally into it.
 Kelly: Let's--okay.
 I smell a tape piece.
 Ryan: Hey, Gelman.
 [laughter]
 We're just booking the show
 left and right.
 So you are a mom of...
 Kelly: Three.
 Ryan: Three now.
 Three, yeah.
 Or five--
 [cheers and applause]
 I say 500.
 It's like it feels like I have
 500 kids.
 That's what it feels like.
 Kelly: You go from man-to-man
 defense to zone defense.
 Whoo!
 Kelly: And I don't know what
 that means; it just seems like
 it ratchets up a lot.
 Oh, my god.
 And everyone's like,
 "How are you?"
 And I'm like, "Exhausted."
 I'm so tired.
 Ryan: How old is the--six
 months is the latest addition?
 She's six months yesterday.
 Kelly: Oh, is she cute.
 Ryan: Oh, my god.
 Look at her little thighs.
 Ryan: That's--
 Oh, my god, you guys.
 Kelly: Do you ever--
 do you chew on her legs?
 I'm out of my mind.
 Kelly: You chew on her.
 I chew on everything.
 Kelly: Mm-hmm.
 I'm--I mean, we're all
 out of our minds with Rani.
 She is so cute.
 Ryan: I love your
 copper pans, though.
 Those are nice in the kitchen.
 Oh, yeah?
 Ryan: Yeah.
 Kelly: Copper pans?
 You noticed pans?
 I have copper pans.
 Ryan: Yeah, she has beautiful
 copper pans.
 I actually collect
 copper pans.
 Ryan: Oh, you do?
 Yeah.
 Ryan: Oh, well, see?
 And I engrave them
 and everything.
 Ryan: Look at that.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: It's so funny.
 I was so busy looking at the
 babe, I did--I was like,
 "Copper pans?"
 Ryan's like,
 "Nice copper pans."
 Ryan: Yeah, I'm--I'm
 installing a kitchen right now.
 Kelly: Is she--are her big
 brothers involved or are they
 like, at the place where
 they're like, "Oh, that's"--you
 know, like, "That's a diaper"?
 Ryder's 15, which is crazy.
 I mean, it's like, I mean,azy. he's almost--he's getting
 up to 6 feet.
 And he's such a great boy.
 Ryan: He's a man.
 Young man.
 Ryan: Yeah.
 [mimics sobbing]
 Kelly: It's okay.
 But the other day, we were--
 I know.
 I'm like, what is it?
 He's so old.
 Uh, but no, he--the other day,
 we went to breakfast, and I was
 juggling a million things, and
 I think it's like, you know,
 really wise to go alone
 with three kids.
 You know, it's like, "Hey,
 let's go to breakfast, kids."
 And then next thing you know,
 I'm not eating, I'm juggling
 everything, and I go to Ryder,
 "Ryder, just take Rani," and I
 went to go get my food at the
 buffet, and I looked over, and
 here's this young man holding
 his sis--I--it was the
 craziest image to me.
 and I just thought, life is
 really weird.
 Ryan: And it goes fast.
 It's so fast--
 yeah, but I was like, 12
 when I--I mean, I--
 Ryan: You were 12
 when you had him?
 Yeah, in terms of, like,
 a Hollywood actress.
 Kelly: Right.
 I say in terms of a
 Hollywood actress, I was like a
 teen mom.
 I mean, that's--you know.
 Yeah, me and Reese
 were like teen moms.
 Kelly: Yeah, that's true.
 Like, we had kids really
 super young.
 Ryan: I mean, just from your
 posts, like, you don't let
 being a busy mom not have
 you have fun.
 Like, you still, like, really--
 [laughter]
 Yeah, you know what I mean?
 Like, you still are you.
 Kelly: But don't you think
 you learned that
 from your family?
 Like, your family--when I look
 at your family, it's with,
 like, admiration and envy,
 'cause you all seem like
 you're having fun...
 Both: All the time.
 Yeah, my parents left us to
 have fun all the time.
 Yeah, it was like,
 "Where are you going?"
 They're like, "We're going
 to Tahiti."
 [laughter]
 Okay.
 Ryan: See you in two weeks!
 Yeah, exactly.
 Uh, no.
 Yeah, I--we do.
 We--we have fun.
 I mean, I--I make sure that,
 you know, kids are good and that
 I take time to, you know...
 Ryan: To enjoy.
 Let out some steam.
 Although, lately it's been hard,
 'cause I'm still breastfeeding.
 I gotta be honest.
 Kelly: Yeah.
 It's like my 40th is coming
 up, and I keep saying, I'm
 just--I deserve a really good
 hangover, and it's gonna happen.
 Kelly: Listen.
 I want to give you
 a birthday present.
 I will watch your children so
 you can go tie one on.
 I will do the whole--
 Ryan: And I'll--and I'll go
 tie one on with you.
 That's good. Perfect.
 Kelly: I will take care--
 I will take care of the babies.
 I'm very responsible.
 So now there's--
 Ryan: Break it down.
 Kelly: Musicians in your
 family.
 You're very musical.
 I love to sing.
 Kelly: Yeah.
 And I play piano.
 Kelly: I didn't know that.
 Yeah, but it's like--I keep
 forgetting I can't swear on
 these shows.
 I almost went there.
 I'm not very good at it.
 I'm--I can write on the piano,
 but I can't, like, sit down and
 read music and be like,
 you know--
 Kelly: Play a concerto.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Ryan: Well, why don't you
 release a single?
 I have a movie coming out--
 I think it's gonna be in the
 fall--that's a musical
 that Sia directed.
 Kelly: Oh.
 Ryan: Oh, wow.
 Yeah, it's the first time
 I've actually sang contemporary
 music.
 That's really exciting.
 And I think after that, I'll
 probably--even just because
 I feel--I feel like it's one of
 those things I have to do at
 some point
 is, I just have to put something
 out there.
 Ryan: Listen.
 I don't care what it does.
 Ryan: Do a--
 Kelly: You know people that
 work on the radio.
 Oh, yeah, that's right.
 Ryan: Yeah.
 [laughs] Oh, that guy.
 Ryan: I tell you how to
 make it a hit.
 Yeah.
 Ryan: Collaborate with
 DJ Khaled.
 Right.
 Ryan: That's all you
 gotta do.
 Just get DJ Khaled, Kate Hudson.
 Kelly: Or Mr. Worldwide.
 Ryan: Or Mr. Worldwide.
 Or Mr. Worldwide.
 Ryan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Kelly: Mm-hmm.
 I got it.
 I miss--you know what, though.
 I have to say, I miss bands.h. I really do.
 Like, my son's really musical.
 Bing is insane--like, almost--
 he has drums.
 I can't get him out of his
 drumming room.
 Ryan: That's great.
 He's now started playing
 keyboard, and he's never
 had a piano.
 Oh, yeah, he's not even
 eight years old.
 Ryan: He's got it
 in the genes.
 It's kind of crazy.
 And I just thought, you know,
 "Oh, he's gonna get in a band
 and, like, ugh,
 it's gonna be tough."
 Ryan: Yeah, yeah, he's gonna
 tour the world.
 It's gonna be a hard life.
 Kelly: Yeah, but it's an
 exciting life, don't you think?
 Being a--a touring musician?
 Ryan: Well, she was--you
 have some experience with that.
 I mean, it's--it's a lot of
 work, you know?
 And it's amazing when you love
 it, but it's a whole different--
 like, jazz cats, like all the
 people that are, like, I'm
 really close to and touring
 musicians who still, like,
 spend, you know,
 200 days a year...
 Both: On the road.
 It's a lot.
 Kelly: I'm thinking about
 your parents, right?
 They were probably like,
 "Oh, gosh, not acting.
 It's such a--like, an unstable
 career," right?
 If you have a calling for it...
 Yeah, do it.
 Kelly: Imagine if your mom
 said to you, "Kate, listen.
 Anything but acting."
 Yeah, I would have been
 very--
 yeah, it would have been hard.
 Ryan: But you're
 entrepreneuring.
 I mean, you've got all of these
 fashion brands.
 You've got a new fashion.
 I just can't stop working.
 Ryan: Great.
 I love to work and, like, I--
 Kelly: Well,
 you're good at it.
 I've always wanted to design
 clothes, and--
 Ryan: What's Happy x Nature?
 So Happy x Nature is my
 first, like, ready to wear
 fashion line.
 Kelly: It's fantastic.
 I'm so happy for you.
 Thank you.
 I'm really excited.
 I'm excited.
 It's one of those things.
 I've been working
 really hard on it.
 I feel like every time I put my
 name to anything, whether I'm
 endorsing it or making it like
 this, I have to believe in it
 and it has to be something that
 I feel is important.
 And so this is a very
 eco-friendly line, and the
 fashion industry is like the
 worst--number two worst carbon
 footprint of all industries.
 And I really feel like the
 fashion industry needs to look
 at how they're making things and
 start changing the way that they
 do stuff, and it's--
 I feel like we--
 [cheers and applause]
 Yeah.
 Kelly: Well--
 And I feel like we're gonna
 really hopefully make an impact
 there.
 Kelly: Well,
 you're a nature girl.
 You grew up in nature,
 really, I mean, so--
 Yeah.
 Ryan: In Brentwood.
 In Brent--
 Kelly: No, but she also--
 Colo--she's a Colorado girl.
 Ryan: Oh, Colorado.
 Okay.
 And then Brentwood.
 Ryan: Then Brentwood.
 [laughter]
 Kelly: Um, and this,
 this is--
 Yeah, yeah.
 Ryan: Um, all right.
 Kelly: This is beautiful.
 Thank you.
 Ryan: So you can go to our
 website for more information
 about Kate's fashion line,
 Happy x Nature.shion line, [cheers and applause]
 Great to see you.
 Announcer: Still ahead on
 "Live," we'll talk with Pitbull. ♪ Excuse me, excuse me ♪
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: Mr. Worldwide dancers.
 Ryan: Yeah, you and me both.
 Kelly: Right?
 Ryan: He is a Grammy-winning
 international superstar,
 Mr. 305, Mr. Worldwide.
 Please welcome Pitbull.
 [cheers and applause]
 Whoo! Whoo!
 Whoo! Whoo!
 [upbeat music]
 Got 'em.
 Got 'em, got 'em, got 'em.

 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: Hi!
 How you doing?
 Kelly: How are you?
 Yes, sir.
 Ryan: Good to see you, baby.
 Yes, sir.
 Ryan: Love it.
 I mean, the fans--
 the fans go nuts.
 Kelly: [laughter]
 Yeah.
 Ryan: Armando fans are here.
 Whoo-hoo!
 [cheers and applause]
 I think--I think I got the
 wrong glasses on.
 Kelly: Oh, yeah, yeah.
 [laughter]
 Oh, my gosh.
 I know.
 I'm sorry.
 You look--
 Ryan: Studious.
 But I can see everybody
 really close right now.
 [laughter]
 Kelly: Sorry about that.
 Sorry.
 Ryan: So listen.
 You just...
 Boom. There we go.
 Ryan: To go back, for people
 who don't know your story.
 It is an incredible story.
 Been very blessed.
 Thank God.
 And thanks to the fans.
 I wouldn't be here
 without y'all.
 Ryan: I'm gonna talk about--
 [cheers and applause]
 The challenges at the beginning
 for you
 and what you did to overcome,
 to get to be who you are now.
 Well, I mean, uh, oof.
 A lot of different obstacles,
 but I think that that's what
 makes the journey fun.s what You know, from nothing
 to something.
 A whole lot of "no"s,
 that's for sure.
 And a whole lot of "you can't,"
 "you won't," "you never will,"
 "don't," "you're crazy,"
 "how dare you?"
 "Impossible."
 And then I flipped every word,
 by the way.
 So my daughter taught me in the
 word "impossible" is "possible."
 Both: Yeah.
 Right?
 And I took the word "can't"
 is "can."
 "Won't" is "won."
 "Don't" is "do."
 And that's exactly what we doing
 with our career.
 Kelly: It's really--
 20 years in the game, baby.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: 20 years too, yeah.
 Kelly: Isn't that great?
 Ryan: That's amazing.
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: You got your first
 record deal from a rap battle.
 Yeah, it was a rap battle
 against--back in the day,
 it was a crew called
 the Ruff Ryders.
 A guy named DMX
 was a part of it.
 I was very--I was invited to
 his video shoot, and I battled
 this guy named Drag-On
 at the video shoot.
 Swizz Beatz was there.
 And Swizz Beatz told me, "I'll
 give you three rounds with the
 drag"--he's a dragon, you know?
 "He's gonna burn you."
 I was like, "Man, I'm just happy
 to be here."
 Kelly: Right.
 [laughter]
 I had home court advantage.
 It was in Miami.
 Both: Yeah.
 Okay.
 I flipped a coupuple words in
 Spanish here and there, called
 out a couple neighborhoods that
 worked out, you know?
 And we won.
 Kelly: Oh, my god.
 That's great.
 And that's where it all started.
 Yep.
 You know what's crazy is, is
 that's on video.
 And the footage, you can't find
 it anywhere.
 Ryan: Really?
 Crazy enough, yeah.
 There's a guy out there.
 Jamie, if you're looking at
 this, I know you still got
 that footage.
 Kelly: Jamie.
 Ryan: Let's go. Cough it up.
 We need to show the world
 that, Jamie.
 Kelly: I would love
 to see that.
 Oh, you will. You will.
 Now that I said that,
 you'll see it.
 It'll be out--
 Ryan: And also when you were
 growing up and your mom would
 put on tapes of Tony Robbins
 in the car, right?
 So I lived in a neighborhood
 called Carol City in Miami.
 And I was not trying to listen
 to Tony Robbins.
 And whenever my mom could take
 me to school, it was a '82 Pinto
 that she would take me
 to school in.
 And she said--she put Tony on.
 I wanted to hear, like,
 2 Live Crew and Poison Clan.
 [laughter]
 So one day I go to change the
 radio, you know, to my music,
 and she's like, "Bam."
 And she said, "Do you pay
 for this car?"
 I said, "No."
 She said, "Well, then
 don't touch my radio."
 [laughter]
 Kelly: And so you were
 listening to Tony Robbins?
 So subliminally, I started
 listening to Tony, and all it
 took was one story, which is the
 story about Colonel Sanders and
 how it took him 1,007 "no"s
 before he could sell his recipe.
 And I thought about it, like,
 "Man, it's hard to get one 'no'
 out of my mom."
 Like, man,
 imagine 1,007 of 'em.
 So the word "no" became "yes."
 You know?
 I welcome failure.
 I welcome the slip.
 I welcome the fall.
 I welcome the "no."
 I mean, well, you guys know.
 Kelly: Yeah, of course.
 Yeah, and failure's the
 mother of all success, and I've
 learned that throughout the
 game, and every record that has
 been huge for us around the
 world thanks to you guys,
 every record exec said,
 "Not gonna work."
 So the minute that they do say,
 "Oh, that's a hit,"
 I'm like, "Oh, throw that out
 the window."
 [laughter]
 Ryan: It's--it's true.
 It's true.
 I mean, you've had--it's like--
 I have the fortunate opportunity
 to play Pitbull's music
 every single day.
 Well, I put you in one of
 the records.
 Ryan: He put me in a lyric.
 I was so excited.
 And I--
 Kelly: Wait, wait, wait.
 What lyric?
 It was, um...
 "Give Me Everything."
 Ryan: Which is a huge
 global hit.
 Where I said,
 "My family's from Cuba,
 but I'm an American idol,
 getting money
 like Seacrest."
 Kelly: Oh, yes!
 [laughter]
 Ryan: More with Pitbull;
 how he became an ugly dog
 after this.
 Yee-ow!
 Announcer: Tomorrow on "Live," the cast of
 "Stranger Things."
 You call that a dog? [dog growls]
 It's all right, guys.
 Slick Dog's got this.
 [upbeat music]

 What are you doing?
 Having fun,
 getting crazy,
 getting loose.
 Go. I'll stall him.
 Go! Go, go!
 [laughter]
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: That's great.
 Kelly: Something
 for the parents.
 Little something
 for the parents.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: That's a scene from
 "UglyDolls" starring Pitbull.
 Yeah.
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: You play a character
 named Uglydog.
 Yeah, you know, I--you know,
 the people at the studio really
 thought this out thoroughly, and
 they was like, "You know,
 your name's Pitbull.
 We want you to play this dog."
 [laughter]
 I was like, "Man, you guys are
 geniuses."
 Ryan: With a--with
 an alter ego, though.
 Yeah, but it's great.
 Well, you know, that's why I
 brought the glasses out today,
 'cause I'm also Slick Dog.
 Both: Right.
 So I'm Uglydog and Slick Dog
 in the movie.
 And what I love about this
 movie, really--you know, why I
 signed up for it, it's thehy I perfect time for the perfect
 message to let everybody know
 that believe it or not,
 perfection doesn't exist.
 Ryan: Yeah.
 You know?
 [cheers and applause]
 And also flip the word "ugly,"
 which the word "ugly" is
 "You gotta love yourself."
 Okay?
 [cheers and applause]
 And--
 [laughter]
 Learning a little bit today,
 huh?
 Ryan: Yeah.
 And especially in a society
 where you got all the kids right
 now on social media, and it's
 all about followers and likes
 when it really should be about
 leaders and unique.
 That's what it--you know, who
 cares--forget about following.
 You know, be yourself.
 Love yourself.
 And that's what this movie
 is all about.
 You got Uglyville and
 Perfectville.
 And guess what?
 Everybody in Uglyville, man,
 they love each other, they have
 fun with each other, make fun of
 each other, they enjoy
 each other.
 Everybody in Perfectville, they
 just, you know, everybody does
 the same thing and they all look
 the same and they all--
 so Uglyville--I can't spoil
 the movie for y'all.
 [laughter]
 You know?
 Ryan: They're getting loose
 in Uglyville.
 I get loose, I have fun, you
 know, I get a chance to enjoy
 and so it was a lot of fun.
 Obviously you see I'm very
 excited about it.
 And they gave me a chance to
 actually be me in a cartoon
 character.
 Kelly: It's really great.
 Yeah, it's fun.
 A lot of fun.
 Ryan: Have you thought about
 being you in a movie?
 Well, you know, let me tell
 you, I'm Mr. Worldwide.
 All right?
 But Ryan, okay--
 Ryan is Mr. Nonexclusive.
 [laughter]
 This man has a deal
 with everybody.
 [laughter]
 So I'm like, "Ryan, how can
 I use your attorney, okay?"
 [laughter]
 So you would understand me when
 it comes to movies.
 I'm more--I like to be more
 off-camera, invest and be
 partners in it.
 Kelly: So are you saying you
 want Ryan to star as you--
 Oh, that would be great.
 That would be great.
 [cheers and applause]
 There you go.
 What?
 Yeah!
 Get it, get it, get it.

 [laughter]
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: I just would watch it
 all day.
 Don't hate.
 Oh, that was great.
 Kelly: That's the greatest
 thing I've ever seen.
 [cheers and applause]
 "UglyDolls," make sure
 you check it out.
 [cheers and applause]
 Announcer: Friday on "Live," Ricky Gervais.
 Ryan: He is an award-winning actor.
 We know him as M'Baku
 from "Black Panther."
 And now he stars in Jordan
 Peele's new thriller "Us."
 Please welcome Winston Duke,
 everybody.
 [cheers and applause]
 [upbeat music]

 Kelly: How are you? So great. So great.
 Kelly: So happy to see you.
 Ryan: How are you?
 Good to see you, man.
 Ryan: Good to see you.
 Oh, wonderful.
 Ryan: Oh, he feels like
 an Oscar winner.
 Kelly: Oh, he does.
 Yes, you actually
 look like an Oscar winner.
 From your lips to God's ears.
 Kelly: Yes, yes.
 Ryan: Well, you guys did--
 you won some Oscars
 for "Black Panther."
 Yeah, we got three Oscars for
 "Black Panther."
 Kelly: What a thrill.
 Yes.
 Kelly: I mean, really,
 what a thrill.
 And is the sequel--are you
 working on the sequel?
 Can we talk about that yet?
 Is that your, like, smooth
 pitch to find out
 what's going on?
 Kelly: No, just trying to
 figure out if there was a sequel
 in the works.
 Yeah, there's definitely
 a "Black Panther 2"...
 Kelly: Good.
 In the works.
 [cheers and applause]
 Everything's very hush-hush with Marvel and Disney around
 it, but you know, if you're
 eager for M'Baku fix, I'll be
 in the "Avengers: Infinity War"
 part 2.
 Kelly: Okay, great.
 So that's coming.
 Ryan: So that's coming
 as well.
 And we understand you're
 celebrating all the success.
 You bought a house?
 I did.
 I did.
 Ryan: Congratulations,
 Happy homeowner.
 Thank you so much.
 Thank you so much.
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: That's what it is.
 I thought--I thought you looked
 more burdened than the last time
 I saw you.
 I think it's with all
 the home renovations,
 that's what it is.
 You know, finding furniture
 that fits.
 Kelly: Exactly.
 Yes, yes.
 Especially 'cause I'm a big guy,
 so I'm always trying to make the
 things work, but you know, it's
 all about size and scale.
 Kelly: You want
 a sumptuous sofa.
 I like that word.
 Kelly: Yes.
 Yeah, sumptuous.
 Kelly: Yeah.
 Ryan: So you have to--
 you actually are shopping for
 larger than normal--
 Um, not nor--
 larger than normal.
 It's just things that fit me
 but also are in proportion
 to the home.
 Kelly: You know, these chairs
 seem to fit you well.
 Maybe you'd like to--
 These work great.
 I might take these.
 Kelly: These could be great
 for the--for the dining room?
 Is this a gift?
 Kelly: Yes, absolutely.
 This is a gift.
 Gelman, we need new chairs.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: Are you moving anything from your current place
 into the new place?
 Um, a couple things.
 But really, it's mainly our
 first family home
 in the States, you know?
 Kelly: So great.
 So it's been just a pleasure
 to be able to do that, be the
 first one to purchase--
 Ryan: Oh, but you have--
 he has citrus.
 I do.
 Ryan: She wants--that's her
 dream is to have citrus.
 Kelly: My dream is to have a
 citrus plant of some kind.
 I live in New York City, so that
 dream is probably never
 going to happen.
 Ryan, unbeknownst to me,
 in all the years--
 Ryan: I was keeping it on the DL like the sequel.
 Kelly: Has an orange grove.
 Oh, my god.
 Kelly: He has a secret
 orange grove.
 What do you have?
 Ryan: In my secret garden.
 I have kumquats.
 Kelly: Oh, no kidding.
 Kumquats.
 And I actually--
 Kelly: The baby orange.
 [laughs]
 Ryan: You can eat them whole.
 You can eat them whole.
 Yes, actually 'cause the skin
 is sweet and the inside is sour.
 Kelly: Yes.
 So there this, like,
 awesome little fruit.
 Kelly: You can make a chutney
 out of it.
 Ooh!
 Kelly: I will make you
 some kumquat chutney.
 Ooh, she said "chutney."
 Kelly: I will make you
 a chutney.
 Can you say it again?
 Kelly: Chutney.
 You could make a chutney
 out of your kumquats.
 Did you know that?
 Yes, yes.
 And I have a little present
 for you.
 I brought you some of
 my kumquats.
 Kelly: No, you did not.
 I did.
 Kelly: Are these your
 kumquats?
 These are my kumquats.
 Kelly: I am going to
 chutney this.
 [cheers and applause]
 Oh, my god.
 Really?
 You just pop one right in?
 Yeah.
 Ryan: They're like satisfying
 in a poppy way.
 Yeah, yeah.
 They're intense.
 They're very intense.
 Ryan: You can eat
 the whole thing.
 Kelly: Mmm.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Ryan: Do you have a--
 Kelly: These are fresh.
 Yeah, they're very fresh.
 [laughter]
 They're from my tree.

 Winston's own.
 [laughter]
 Kelly: We're gonna make you--
 we're gonna make--we're gonna
 manufacture your chutney.
 Let's do it.
 Kelly: M'Baku's chutney.
 [laughter]
 M'Baku's vegetarian chutney.
 Kelly: Tell me that--
 I think that's a glorious--
 Kelly: That is a
 trillion-dollar idea.
 Ryan: Do you cook?
 I'm gonna grab my--
 I cook a little bit.
 But because my size is always
 going up and down
 for each role--
 Ryan: Yeah, I know
 the feeling.
 [laughter]
 Kelly: Do you have to do that
 a lot?
 A lot. A lot.
 So for M'Baku, I gained
 about 40 pounds.
 And then for upcoming movie,
 "Us," Jordan Peele didn't want
 me to feel like a superhero, so
 he was like, "If you could just
 eat some burgers or something."
 So you can look just like a dad
 who has responsibilities
 other than going to the gym.
 Kelly: Isn't that amazing?
 Like, it's--and I think that
 this is a uniquely male thing
 that men in their roles can go
 up and down the scale with
 relative ease.
 Like, just have a couple of
 burgers.
 Yeah.
 It's--it's--it's--that was
 fun, but then losing the weight
 is not.
 Kelly: No, oh, okay.
 Well, I'm glad to hear you
 say that.
 Ryan: Let's take
 a break and--
 this is your tree.
 Just plant those and you'll have
 your very own citrus tree.
 Kelly: Until the first frost.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: We'll come right back
 and talk about "Us"
 right after this.

 [clicking] Hey.
 Hey!
 Hey! Hey!
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: [laughing]
 You got goosebumps?
 Kelly: Yes.
 Ryan: We are scared
 in thrillers like this.
 Kelly: Yes.
 Jordan Peele, I am convinced,
 is a terrifying person
 in real life.
 [laughter]
 He actually is really just like
 a calm, smooth, unassuming guy.
 And you'd never think that was
 going on up there.
 Kelly: What is going on
 up there, though?
 Yeah, that's really
 the thing.
 Kelly: How does he come up
 with these scenarios?
 I think he's just very
 imaginative, and you know, his
 take on American cinema--
 'cause I feel that's really what
 "Get Out" and this movie is
 doing is interrogating America as a culture
 with really interesting
 "what-if"s.
 Ryan: How many people
 live through this?
 'Cause it looks--
 I can't tell you that one.
 Ryan: Do you survive?
 I can't tell you that one.
 Ryan: What can you tell us
 about this?
 Kelly: What can you tell us
 about "Us"?
 [laughter]
 What can you tell us?
 What I can say is that it's
 deeply really just a family
 drama.
 It's about a family caught in an
 interesting scenario, and they
 have to fight for their lives,
 and they're confronted with
 essentially their own demons,
 which are these doppelganger
 figures.
 Ryan: Oh, boy.
 That look exactly like them.
 Ryan: But at least
 you have a bat.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: I mean, look--I just
 want to--I want everybody to
 look at that photo.
 Hmm.
 Kelly: Tell--that is--
 I mean--
 Ryan: Terrifying.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: Terrifying.
 It's terrifying and then,
 you know, being in that space,
 being in that headspace and that
 body was really tough to stay
 in, because you had to go a--
 I have to go to a really
 interesting place.
 But we're--we were
 well supported.
 Kelly: Was it a heavy place?
 Um, heavy emotionally,
 because--I can't tell you
 anything without giving
 a big spoiler.
 But it's a dark place for these
 characters, and I never
 judge them.
 I never looked at them
 as any kind of a villain.
 Kelly: You can't, can you?
 At all.
 So that was a really big
 important part of doing the work
 is not judging those characters,
 especially these ones.
 And you'll find out
 really soon why.
 Ryan: Well, we truly get to
 see your versatility in
 everything that you do.
 Great to have you with us, man.
 Kelly: I love--
 I love a Jordan Peele film.
