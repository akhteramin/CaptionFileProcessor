 THE THEME WAS CAMP.
 NOTES ON FASHION, AND EVERYONE
 WAS EXPECTED TO PULL OUT THE
 STOPS.
 WHAT IS CAMP?
 IT IS DEFINED AS THE LOVE OF
 THE UNNATURAL, ARTIFICE, AND
 EXAGGERATION.
 BASICALLY, EVERYTHING THAT IS
 FABULOUS IRONIC OR EXTRA.
 LET'S GET TO THE FASHION AND
 TITLE THIS YEAR FOR MOST LIVED
 GOES TO KATY PERRY WHETHER YOU
 HATE IT OR LIKE IT, SHE
 DEFINITELY IS HAVING PEOPLE
 TALKING.
 SHE WORE THIS ILLUMINATED
 CHANDELIER LOOK CREATED FOR HER
 BY JEREMY, KIM KARDASHIAN
 SHOWED OFF HER FIGURE IN A
 SKINTIGHT LATEX COURSE ADDRESS,
 BLAIR CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT TO
 CREATE A LOOK WHICH TOOK GUYS
 EIGHT MONTHS TO COMPLETE BY THE
 WAY, IT APPEARED TO BE DRIPPING
 WET THANKS TO THE CRYSTALS AND
 SHIMMERING MATERIAL.
 KATIE HOLMES AND JAMIE FOXX
 MADE A PUBLIC DEBUT AS A COUPLE
 LAST NIGHT WHILE THEY DIDN'T
 HIT THE PINK CARPET TOGETHER,
 THE COUPLE DID POSE FOR PHOTOS
 WITH ONE ANOTHER INSIDE AND
 KENDALL AND KYLIE JENNER BROKE
 OUT THE FEATHERS, TETHER WORE A
 BRIGHT ORANGE FOR SUCH A DOWN,
 WHILE KYLIE WENT FOR A MATCHING
 WIG.
 JANEL MONET EMBRACED WEARABLE
 ART WITH THIS CUSTOM LOOK, AND
 EVEN WINKED AS SHE CUT DOWN THE
 CARPET.
 LADY GAGA SERVED AT MULTIPLE
 LOOKS, ALL CREATED BY BRANDON
 MAXWELL, IT STARTED OFF WITH A
 HUGE PINK DRESS, IT TOOK AN
 ARMY OF MEN WITH UMBRELLAS, SHE
 THEN STRIPPED DOWN TO A BLACK
 DRESS FOLLOWED BY A SKINTIGHT
 PINK DRESS AND THEN IT ALL
 ENDED UP WITH HER POSING IN HER
 UNDERWEAR, HERE IT COMES.
 YES GIRL.
 HUGE PLATFORM SHOES.
 SERENA WILLIAMS WORE THIS
 STUNNING NEON YELLOW EVER

 NEON NIKES.
 JENNIFER LOPEZ SPARKLED IN THIS

 A PLUNGING NECKLINE AND FRINGE
 DETAILING, SHE WORE A MATCHING
 HEADPIECE OF COURSE A-ROD IS A
 GOOD ACCESSORY, RIGHT?
 LIVE ETA EMBRACED THE
 RAINBOW WITH THIS VERSE ARCHIE
 GOWN, PINK STAR PAM DOWN
 RUFFLES, CHECK OUT THE GOLD
 AFRO PITS IN HER HAIR, WITH
 RAISED FIST LOGOS.
 YES.
 JARED LETTER, MY FAVORITE, HAD
 THE BEST ACCESSORY OF A NICE,
 CUSTOM REPLICA, OF HIS HEAD.
 HE BROUGHT ALONG ROCKING THIS
 GUCCI DRESS.
 CASEY MUSGRAVE LOOK LIKE A
 BARBIE DOLL IN THIS DRESS.
 PAIRING IT WITH A BLOW DRYER
 BAG AND CAT EYE SHADES.
 CARDY B WON THE AWARD FOR THIS
 GOWN, THE 10 FOOT LONG TRAIN IT
 NEARLY TOOK OVER THE PINK
 CARPET.
 SIERRA MIGHT HAVE ONE BEST TEAR
 OF THE NIGHT, I THINK SHE ONE
 LET'S BE HONEST WITH THIS VERY
 EXTRA GORGEOUS AFRO, SHE ALSO
 WORE A CUSTOM EMERALD GREEN
 CROWN BECAUSE SHE IS A QUEEN
 AND SUNDAY I HAD A FAIRLY --
 FAIRYTALE MOMENT TRANSFORMING
 INTO CINDERELLA IN THIS TOMMY
 HILFIGER BALLGOWN WITH A SKIRT
 THAT LIT UP.
 YES YES YES.
 YOU DRINK SOME WATER.
 WE WILL TALK.
 I ACTUALLY LOOKED AT JEFF
 MIDWAY AND HER EYES WERE CLOSED.
 I WAS OUT, I WAS SPEAKING
 ABOUT CHEESE AND CRACKERS AND
 WHAT I WILL DO TONIGHT.
 WHAT I WAS THINKING IS THIS
 COFFEE IS BETTER, I SHOULD
 THINK ABOUT A DIFFERENT KIND OF
 COFFEE.
 I GUESS I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO
 REALLY APPRECIATES THE LOOK AS
 ART.
 THEY'RE THERE TO ENTERTAIN
 US.
 LIKE SOMEBODY HAS TO SHAKE IT
 UP A BIT, WE CAN'T ALL WEAR
 KHAKIS AND POLO SHIRTS.
 SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SHAKE IT UP
 AND PUSH THE ENVELOPE.
 I'M FOR UNIVERSAL UNIFORMS
 EVERY DAY.
 STAR TREK?
 YESTERDAY
 BORING.
 I WEAR THE SAME THING TO
 WORK EVERY DAY, THAT'S FINE FOR
 ME.
 DESPITE I DO THE SAME THING.
 TORY, DID YOU HAVE A
 FAVORITE EVEN IF YOU WERE BORED
 BY IT?
 I DID HAVE A FAVORITE.
 EZRA MILLER  ABSOLUTELY NAILED
 CAMP, AND THIS IS A GUY WHO IS
 GENDER FLUID AND HE USED
 PROSTHETICS, YOU REALLY GOT
 THOSE WEREN'T REALIZE?
 NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID
 BUT IT'S ABOUT THE ARTIFICE AND
 EXAGGERATION OF THE LIKE TO THE
 GENDER FLUIDITY, THAT WAS ALL
 OVER THE RED CARPET.
 PINK CARPET, EXCUSE ME.
 I LOVE THAT TOO.
 I'M GOING TO NOD MY HEAD AND
 PRETEND I KNOW WHAT ARTIFICE
 MEANS.
 ARTIFICIAL MISS.
 CAMP IS VERY CATCHY AND FAKE
 AND OVERDONE.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 CAMPY.
 WE DO CALL YOU AL FASHION,
 YOU HAD TO HAVE A FAVORITE?
 MY BOY NICK JONAS.
 YOUR BOY?
 WE GO WAY BACK.
 HE LOOKS LIKE A WAITER AT
 THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY DOESN'T
 HE?
 IN DUBAI.
 THE DUBAI CHEESECAKE FACTORY.
 YOU NAILED IT.
 JEFF, DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE?
 I KNOW EVERYONE HATES THE
 GENDERS I SHOULD SAY, CHECK
 THEM OUT BUT I LIKE HOW THEY
 DIDN'T WALK WITH THEIR DATES
 DOWN THE CARPET.
 THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
 LISTEN.
 I THINK ALL THE WORK THESE
 FASHION DESIGNERS PUT INTO
 THESE OUTFITS, I REALLY WANT TO
 GIVE THEM SOME CREDIT.
 WHO WAS YOUR FAVORITE?
 JANEL MONET.
 THAT DRESS IS ART, YOU GUYS.
 AGAIN WITH THE GENDER FLUIDITY,
 I THINK THAT JARED LETTER, WITH
 THAT GORGEOUS RED DOWN, AND WHO
 DOESN'T LOVE A SEVERED HEAD AS
 A PURSE.
 I DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS
 HE'S WEARING A GOWN, I THINK
 THAT'S THE WAY YOU DO IT IS YOU
 JUST CARRY HUNDRED I DIDN'T
 REALIZE IT WAS A DOWN UNTIL YOU
 SAID SOMETHING.
 THAT WAS A PURSE?
 OR AN ACCESSORY BUT HE HELD
 IT LIKE A PURSE.
 HE SURE DID.
 I'M ALL FOR IT.
 WHAT IF MARK SHOWED UP WITH
 A PURSE OF YOUR HEAD?
 FASHION.
 EXACTLY.
 LET'S GET TO THIS NEXT STORY.
 AN UPDATE TO THE COLLEGE
 ADMISSION SCANDAL.
 LORI LOCKLIN'S DEFENSE MIGHT
 HAVE GOTTEN A BOOST THANKS TO
 THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
 CALIFORNIA'S CREW TEAM.
 REPORTING THIS OUT FOR THE TEAM
 POSTING ALL OVER CAMPUS.
 YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS NO
 EXPERIENCE NO PROBLEM, SOME SAY
 THE POSTER COULD HELP THE
 DEFENSE.
 HER DAUGHTER'S LACK OF
 EXPERIENCE, THE TEAM DOESN'T
 REQUIRE EXPERIENCE TO JOIN,
 LORI OF COURSE IS ACCUSED OF
 PAYING BRIBES TO TOSS PASS HER
 OFF AS ATHLETIC RECRUITS IN
 ORDER TO GET THEM INTO USC.
 NOW, TORY, I KNOW YOU ARE OUR
 LEGAL EAGLE.
 THIS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL,
 BECAUSE IF LORI LOCKLIN IS
 GOING TO USE THIS AS A DEFENSE,
 SHE IS SUGGESTING THAT ALL OF
 US ARE STUPID.
 SHE IS SUGGESTING THAT
 EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO HAS
 WORKED HARD TO GET INTO A
 UNIVERSITY, WHETHER YOU ARE AN
 ASSET ATHLETE, WHETHER YOU ARE
 A SCHOLAR, AGAIN, IS A STUPID.
 COULD THIS WORK FOR HER?
 IT COULD GO BOTH WAYS.
 IT COULD BACKFIRE COMPLETELY,
 BECAUSE IT IS SO OBVIOUS.
 WE HAVE HER ON TAPE BEING LIKE
 TAKE A PICTURE OF THEM AND SEND
 IT IN.
 WE KNOW THE REAL THING.
 SHE INSULTED SO MANY PEOPLE
 WHEN PLEADING NOT GUILTY.
 THAT'S WHERE SHE MADE A MISTAKE
 AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.
 IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON TO BE
 LIKE, MAYBE SHE DID NOT KNOW,
 THOUGH.
 SO, THEY ARE USING THE LOOPHOLE
 DEFENSE, IT'S A HAIL MARY, BUT
 IT HAS WORKED BEFORE.
 ALL SHE WANTS TO DO IS AVOID
 PRISON TIME.
 I THINK SHE'S GOING TO DO
 THAT.
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 LISTEN.
 SHE IS NOT CALLING US STUPID.
 OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS CALLING
 US STUPID.
 THE PEOPLE WHO DEFEND HER ARE
 CALLING US STUPID BECAUSE IF
 SHE GETS OFF IT JUST PROVES
 THAT OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK.
 THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
 YOU ARE RIGHT.
 YOU CAN BUY YOUR WAY OUT OF
 JAIL.
 MANY WOULD ARGUE OUR SYSTEM
 WORKS IN THE OPPOSITE WAY
 BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE WOMEN OF
 COLOR WHO ARE LOCKED OUT FOR
 SENDING YOUR KID TO A PUBLIC
 SCHOOL IN A DIFFERENT ZIP CODE.
 YES.
 AL, DOES THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM
 WORK OR DOES IT NOT WORK,
 DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT
 INSIDE THAT LENS?
 I THINK IT IS WORKING
 PERFECTLY.
 IT CATERS TO THE RICH.
 IF YOU ARE RICH, YOU DON'T SEE
 JAIL AS A DETERRENT.
 ANYBODY THAT HAS MONEY, YOU CAN
 GET A GOOD ATTORNEY, THEY COST
 DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY SOME
 OF THEM FREE, SOME WILL SAY
 TAKE THE DEAL.
 A GREAT LAWYER WILL GO THROUGH
 EVERYTHING.
 ALL THEY NEED IS ONE THING, AND
 THAT IS WHY YOU PAY THAT MONEY.
 IF YOU HAVE MONEY, YOU'RE GOING
 TO GET THAT LAWYER AND THEY
 WILL GET YOU OFF.
 THAT IS WHY JEFF FEELS LIKE
 THAT BECAUSE IT IS TRUE.
 SHAME ON HER AND SHAME ON
 THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
 WE NEED REFORM AND WE NEED
 REFORM NOW.
 DAILY BLAST LIVE IS LIVE, WE
 BRING YOU BREAKING NEWS AS IT
 HAPPENS, COMING UP, A CAPPELLA
 NEVER SOUNDED SO GOOD.
 THE BAND PENTATONIC TAKES TIME
 TO CHAT WITH US IN THE MIDDLE
 OF THEIR FIRST-EVER WORLD TOUR.
 THEN, AN EYE-OPENING STUDY ALL
 ABOUT SUNSCREEN.
 THE SURPRISING NEW FINDINGS
 THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU RETHINK THE
 KIND OF SUNBLOCK YOU USE, YOU
 THE VIEWER ARE OUR FIFTH
 HOUSTON WE WANT YOUR TAKE ON
 THIS CONTROVERSIAL STORY.
 A BARTENDER IS IN TROUBLE AFTER
 PROSECUTORS SAY SHE OVERSERVED
 A MAN RIGHT BEFORE GOING ON A
 SHOOTING RAMPAGE.
 SHOULD SHE BE CHARGED WITH THE
 CRIME, SENDING COMMENTS RIGHT
 NOW, WE WILL READ THEM LIVE
 NEXT.
 WELCOME BACK. IT IS TIME FOR FIFTH POST, WHEN
 WE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE
 TALKING ABOUT, A TEXAS
 BARTENDER HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND
 CHARGED FOR OVER SERVING A MAN
 THE NIGHT HE SHOT AND KILLED
 EIGHT PEOPLE.
 LINDSAY GLASS IS ACCUSED OF
 VIOLATING A STATE LAW BY
 SELLING ALCOHOL TO AN
 INTOXICATED OR INSANE PERSON.
 POLICE SAY SHE SHOULD HAVE
 KNOWN TO STOP SERVING THE MAN
 BECAUSE HE APPEARED DRUNK AND
 ARMED.
 TURNED OUT, HIS BLOOD-ALCOHOL
 LEVEL WAS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES
 THE LEGAL LIMIT.
 AFTER LEAVING THE BAR, THE MAN
 KILLED HIS ESTRANGED WIFE AND
 SEVEN OTHERS BEFORE DYING IN A
 POLICE SHOOTOUT.
 THE BARTENDER NOW FACES UP TO A
 YEAR IN PRISON, A FINE OF $500
 OR BEST, SHOULD SHE BE CHARGED
 WITH A CRIME.
 NOW, SHE WOULDN'T BE CHARGED
 FOR MURDER, THIS WOULD BE A
 MISDEMEANOR, SO TO SPEAK AT
 THIS POINT TO CLARIFY THAT
 I THINK THE BARTENDER IS
 RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING PATRONS
 FROM BECOMING UNREASONABLY
 INTOXICATED.
 BUT ONLY THE SHOOTER IS
 RESPONSIBLE FOR MURDER.
 BOBBY, GREAT TAKE.
 YOU USE THE WORD THERE
 UNREASONABLY INTOXICATED.
 FOUR TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT
 MEANS YOU PROBABLY CAN'T STAND
 UP.
 THE FACT THAT THIS MAN WAS
 ARMED, TO THE POINT WHERE SHE
 WAS AWARE OF IT, I THINK SHE
 SHOULD BE IMPLICATED IN SOME
 WAY, MY WHOLE THING, I'M NOT
 THROWING PEOPLE IN JAIL, THE
 SHOULD BE USED TO TEACH OTHER
 PEOPLE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
 TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO SERVE DRUNK
 PEOPLE WITH GUNS, BUT SOME
 PEOPLE GOT TO LEARN THEIR
 LESSON I GUESS.
 PATTY FROM FACEBOOK SAYS
 BARS ARE JUST OUT TO MAKE
 MONEY, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT
 THE DANGERS OF ALCOHOL THIS
 NEEDS TO CHANGE.
 SAM YOU WERE A BARTENDER,
 THERE ARE STRICT LAWS ABOUT
 SERVING PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN
 REASONABLY SEE OUR OVERSERVED.
 THEY MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF
 YOU.
 IN LOS ANGELES IT'S A
 CORPORATION CALLED ABC, THEY
 TRAIN YOU AND LET YOU KNOW
 ABOUT RED FLAGS.
 GOD FORBID YOU EVER SERVE
 SOMEONE, BOTH JEFF AND I HAVE
 CUT MANY PEOPLE OFF.
 WE HAVE BOTH SEEN PEOPLE, OUR
 COLLEAGUES, DRAGGED OUT OF THAT
 BAR IN HANDCUFFS, BECAUSE OF A
 DUI, YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE YOU
 COULD KILL YOURSELF.
 THOUGHT OUT THE BACK DOOR
 THEY MAKE SURE THEY SEE THEM AT
 THE FRONT DOOR, IT IS A BIG
 DEAL.
 ALCOHOL IS A DRUG.
 I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
 LIABLE.
 IF YOU ARE A GUN MAKER SELLING
 TO AN UNDERAGE PERSON BY
 MISTAKE YOU ARE LIABLE, IF THEY
 SHOOT SOMEONE YOU ARE ALSO
 LIABLE.
 SHE BROKE THE LAW.
 BUT I DO WANT TO SET THIS UP
 THOUGH, WE TALK ABOUT THIS
 STORY WE SET UP FOR A MINUTE,
 WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS GUY WAS
 COMING UP TO THE BAR, WE DON'T
 KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
 OBVIOUSLY I'VE SEEN SOMEONE
 FALL OUT OF THE CHAIR, I KNOW
 TO CUT THEM OFF.
 IF THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE,
 I DON'T KNOW.
 IN SPITE OF THE DRINKING AND
 THE BACK ROOM?
 DID A DRINK BEFORE THEY
 CAME?
 THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO
 THIS WEEKEND JUST TO SPECULATE
 ON WHAT THE BARTENDER DID OR
 DID NOT SEE.
 MARCUS FROM PITTSBURGH SAYS HOW
 COULD THE BARTENDER HAVE KNOWN
 WHAT THIS GUY WAS GOING TO DO
 AFTER LEAVING.
 HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR
 THEIR OWN ACTIONS.
 MARCUS I LOVE YOU FOR SAYING
 THAT.
 ACCOUNTABILITY.
 I THINK A WORD THAT HAS BEEN
 ERASED FROM THE DICTIONARY.
 BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR YOUR OWN
 ACTIONS, NOT BECAUSE YOUR FIFTH
 GRADE TEACHER GAVE YOU AN AND
 CALLED YOU A NAME, THAT IS WHY
 YOU WENT AND SHOT UP EVERYBODY,
 NOT BECAUSE THE BARTENDER OVER
 SURETY  OVERSERVED YOU, HOLD
 THIS MAN ACCOUNTABLE.
 DOES THIS LADY NEED TO DO HER
 JOB DEPENDING ON THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES?
 MAYBE.
 THIS MAN IS ACCOUNTABLE, NOT
 ANYBODY ELSE.
 HE'S THE ONE WHO KILLED EIGHT
 PEOPLE, LET'S NOT FORGET THAT
 THEIR DISPATCH THANKS GREAT
 TAKES EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR
 WRITING APPEARED COMING UP, EAT
 BETTER SLEEP BETTER.
 I AM ALREADY SOLD.
 WE HAVE THE TOP FOLDS THAT A

 CHATTING WITH THE STARS.
 Reporter: SCOTT MITCH AND
 KEVIN, WELCOME TO DAILY BLAST
 LIVE.
 PENTATONIC'S ARE ABOUT TO KICK
 OFF A WORLD TOUR, BUT I WOULD
 LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR
 EARLY DAYS.
 YOU GUYS MADE YOUR MARK
 COVERING POPULAR SONGS ON
 YOUTUBE.
 IS THERE A SONG OR ARTIST YOU
 HAVE NOT COVERED YET, BUT YOU
 HAVE YOUR SIGHTS SET ON?
 WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE A
 TAYLOR SWIFT SONG.
 YEAH.
 WE COULD DO THE NEW ONE.
 EXACTLY.
 THAT WOULD BE FUN.
 YOU GUYS KEEP TALKING WORLD
 TOUR.
 YET THERE ARE STILL SOME
 CRITICS WHO SAY YOU GUYS ARE
 JUST A COVER BAND.
 HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT
 CRITICISM?
 IT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER US.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE TAKE
 SONGS WE LOVE AND DO THEM IN A
 WAY THAT ONLY WE CAN DO THEM
 WHICH IS A VERY SPECIAL ABILITY
 WE HAVE CREATED OVER THE PAST
 FEW YEARS AND IT'S BEEN REALLY
 FUN GETTING INTO A ORIGINAL
 MUSIC, IT'S A JOURNEY AND WE
 HOPE WE CONTINUE TO GROW.
 I WANT TO PLAY A RAPIDFIRE
 QUESTION GAME WITH YOU ALL.
 I'M CALLING IT ANSWERS WITH
 PENTATONIC.
 ARE YOU READY?
 FIRST ONE, WHO IN THE BAND IS
 ALWAYS LATE TO REHEARSAL?
 ME.
 I'M ALWAYS LIKE FIVE MINUTES
 LATE.
 WHO IS THE MOM OF THE GROUP?
 COUNTER I THINK.
 THAT'S NICE.
 IS THE MOST ORGANIZED.
 THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT.
 WHO CALLS THEM ON THE MOST?
 YOU DO.
 GOOD SON AWARD.
 WHO IS ALWAYS TAKING CELL FEES?
 KIRSTEN.
 WHO IS ALWAYS SNACKING?
 SNACKING?

 PROBABLY SCOTT.
 AND THE LAST ONE, AS A
 GROUP WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE
 SONG TO PERFORM?
 BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.

 PLEASER.
 SINCE THAT IS YOUR FAVORITE,
 DO YOU MIND GIVING ME A LITTLE
 SNIPPET?
 OH MY GOSH, IT'S HARD ENOUGH
 WITH FIVE PEOPLE REALLY HAVE
 THREE PEOPLE WITH US RIGHT NOW.
 I WOULD OFFER MY SERVICES
 BUT, BELIEVE ME, YOUR EARS
 WOULD BE DAMAGED FOR LIFE.
 THANK YOU GUYS, SCOTT KEVIN
 AND MITCH, THREE OF THE FIVE
 VOICES OF PENTATONIC'S.
 ON A WORLD TOUR CHECK THESE
 GUYS OUT IN A CITY NEAR YOU YOU
 WILL NOT REGRET IT.
 THANKS GUYS YOU'VE BEEN
 AWESOME.
 THANK YOU, YOU TOO.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 PROMOTIONAL CONSIDERATION IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY:
       You've tried so many          moisturizers...
 but one blows them all
 out of the water.
 Hydro Boost with hyaluronic acid
        to plump skin cells
            so it bounces back...
            Neutrogena®
   And try our hydrating makeup.
 WELCOME BACK TO DBL. MAKING THE RIGHT FOOD CHOICES
 CAN BE TOUGH, TORY MEETS UP
 WITH A NUTRITIONIST TO LEARN
 ABOUT FOODS THAT WILL HELP YOU
 SLEEP BETTER, TAKE A LOOK.
 HI GUYS WE ARE HERE WITH
 SARAH PETER, HOLISTIC
 NUTRITIONIST AT FAMILY
 NUTRITION SERVICES SHE IS HERE
 TO TELL US HOW FOOD CAN AFFECT
 YOUR SLEEP.
 I KNOW.
 TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW SLEEP AND
 EATING GO TOGETHER, BECAUSE I
 NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 WHO HASN'T HAD TROUBLE SLEEPING
 AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER.
 I KNOW I HAVE.
 WHAT ARE SPECIFIC FOODS?
 THERE ARE FOODS RICH IN
 AMINO ACID CALLED CALLED
 TRYPTOPHAN.
 THE FIRST ONE IS TURKEY.
 RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE
 IS SO SLEEPY AND THANKS GIVING.
 NUTS ARE ACCESSIBLE SOURCE
 OF TRYPTOPHAN.
 JUST EATING A BIT A DAY CAN
 BOOST YOUR TRYPTOPHAN LEVELS
 POINT
 YOU BE NUTS NOT TO DO IT.
 TOTALLY NUTS.
 WHAT ELSE OTHER THAN NUTS?
 MY FAVORITE ONE OF ALL IS
 CHERRIES.
 CHERRIES WHEN THEY CONTAIN
 MELATONIN BUT ACTUALLY JUST HOW
 TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR BODIES ON
 PRODUCTION OF MELATONIN.
 THIS IS SLEEP HORMONE IS ONE OF
 THE HORMONES THAT REGULATES OUR
 CIRCADIAN RHYTHM.
 CHERRIES, NUTS, WHAT ELSE?
 FISH.
 ACTUALLY IS A SLEEP REMEDY, NOT
 THOUGHT OF BUT IT SHOULD BE
 BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY HIGH
 LEVEL OF VITAMIN B6.
 B6 HELPS YOU SLEEP?
 VITAMIN B6 IS ACTUALLY
 IMPORTANT FOR THAT CONVERSION
 OF TRYPTOPHAN TO SEROTONIN.
 I SEE POINT
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NUTS,
 AMINO ACIDS IN OUR BODIES USE
 TO CONVERT TO SEROTONIN BUT IF
 YOU ARE LOW IN B6 THAT
 CONVERSION DOESN'T IT LAYS
 QUITE AS NATURALLY.
 I WANT TO THANK SARAH PETER
 NOW FOR DEALING WITH ME FIRST
 OFFENSE FOR TEACHING US
 ACCESSIBLE THINGS TO DO RIGHT
 NOW AT THE GROCERY STORE TO
 HELP YOUR OWN BODY NATURALLY
 GET TO SLEEP.
 I GUESS I NEED TO STOCK UP ON
 CHERRIES.
 YOU BEEN HAVING TROUBLE SHE
 ALSO MENTIONED TO ME YOGURT.
 YOU MAKE A SMOOTHIE AND INCLUDE
 ALL OF THIS, YOGA CHERRIES
 WALNUTS, YOU CAN SORT OF MAKE A
 SLEEPY TIME SMOOTHIE.
 SO IF YOU THINK MAY BE RIGHT
 WHEN YOU ARE FEELING IT YOU CAN
 GET IN THE MOOD TO SLEEP.
