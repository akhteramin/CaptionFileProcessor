so they had to remove the bone, like, the skull. 
- Francesca? 
- Yes. 
- If I followed normal protocol on this, you would end up with no car. 
- This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio where people and cases are met with compassion. A different kind of judge. A courtroom like no other. This is Caught in Providence. 
- Who's Mr. Holder? 
- Uh, this is Mr. Holder, Your Honor. 
- And, and are you here with him? 
- Uh, yes, I'm his counselor at the Riverwood program. 
- Okay, and who's gonna do the speaking? 
- Uh, I am at Mr. Holder's request. 
- All right, what do you wanna tell me about this? 
- Uh, basically, he received the ticket on Sunday morning. Uh, it's not at all his first parking-
- 
- Saturday. 
- I'm sorry? Saturday morning, I'm sorry. It's not at all his first ticket. 
- He's had, he's had 31 tickets. 
- Uh, obviously, I'm his counselor for significant reasons. At the same time, it's something that we're working on engagingly with Mr. Holder. And, uh, truthfully, speaking, the tickets are becoming further and further apart. Uh, he happened to have been parked across from Burnside Park in front of the old Bank of America building. On this particular morning, uh, he was attending a church service. Sometimes he goes there also to meet up with his daughter who's currently in a homeless situation. Uh, so we are hoping that, uh, Your Honor could find the reason hopefully to waive this and know that we're working actively in terms of keeping this from happening. 
- Is he homeless now? 
- Uh, currently speaking, he lives with his father at an assisted living residence in East Providence. But, uh, actually, we have an appointment next week with the Gateway group to hopefully line up housing-
- affordable housing in North Providence. 
- Tell me about the program. I don't know what the program is about. 
- Um, we're a social services agency. We're under the Horizon Group. We have two locations. One in Providence, one in Warren, Rhode Island, uh, you know, in the East Bay area. Uh, Mr. Holder's been a longtime client of ours and whatnot. I've been working as his counselor for about the last nine months. 
- What's the name of the program? 
- Riverwood, one word. 
- Are you familiar with that? 
- No, but I am familiar with Horizon, uh, I have heard of that. 
- It's basically human services and social work, primarily the role of the Providence program is to provide, uh... affordable housing for low-income individuals. 
- Based on your representation, I'm gonna dismiss it. 
- Thank you. 
- But I want Mr. Holder to know that... this doesn't give you a license in the future to say, It's okay, I'll bring my counselor down and I can get out and get way with it, okay? I'm doing this based on his representation. Do you understand that? You explain it to him when he gets out 'cause he's homeless, okay? All right. 
- It's our intention to avoid it if at all possible. Thank you, Your Honor. 
- Okay. 
- I'm just trying to see if he gives me attitude. 
- Despite what you may be thinking, I believe this motorist actually made two wise choices in court today. The first having his social worker speak for him. Can you imagine what would've happened if he had opened his mouth? I think he'd still be enjoying the hospitality of one of our local correctional institutions. The second is that he waited until he passed Inspector Carignan before he disrespected the Judge. Trust me, that may have been the wisest move of his life. 
- Anthony Michael Giacobbi. Good morning, Mr. Giacobbi. 
- Good morning, sir. 
- What do your friends call you? They call you Tony? They call you A.M.? What do they call you? 
- I can't say what they call me. 
- I expected that kind of an answer. You're from, uh... Where are you from, Nevada? 
- Yes, sir. 
- Yeah? What are you doing in Rhode Island? 
- What am I doing? I moved back here, stupidly. 
- Are you calling me stupid? 
- I was thinking about it, but I... Listen, I'm gonna tell you something. That's not nice. Mr. Giacobbi, uh... You're charged with going through red light on Allens Avenue and Terminal Street. We watching these today? We should watch it. 
- Yes. 
- All right. Here's what we're gonna do, Mr. Giacobbi. I'm gonna watch it. Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue. There are two stop lines. If you are past the first stop line when the light turns red, I'll dismiss it. If you're not past it, it's gonna cost you 85 bucks. We're gonna take a look at it. Look up here. 
- It's already red, Judge. Show the time light. It was r red for 16.2 seconds, Judge. 
- If I look at this... I look at this every day and... I'm supposed to know that when the light clicks three times that it's red. Supposed to know that. I think we're all supposed to know that. So, they send me this kind of a video in a court of law. I can't tell what color the light is. I know it changed three times, Inspector Quinn, but it went from white to white to white. 
- No, it didn't change at all, Judge. It stayed... red according to the notice. But according to the video, I agree with you, Judge. I couldn't determine... 
- No. The answer is I am not convinced by clear and convincing evidence. They didn't present clear and convincing evidence to me that the light was red. I never saw red on the screen. I saw it all white. I know it changed three times, but I don't know when it changed three times what color it was. That's a very long story. But the result is that I'm gonna dismiss the case because the city has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that you went through a red light. Now is there anything you wanna say? 
- Thank you. 
- Oh. He's never told me what your friends call you. What do you friends call you? They call you Tony? They all you Anthony? What do they call you? 
- (bleep) hole. 
- His middle name. 
- Thank you, sir. 
- Well, I guess we had it coming. The Judge did ask him three times what his friends called him. Based on his response, we know he wasn't lying. He really is an (bleep) hole. 
- Jose Horentos. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- You had a parking ticket on Thayer Street, sir. 
- Yes, um... That day I wasn't driving the car. I was just getting out of the hospital 'cause I had brain surgery. And my son literally parked at the corner of CVS and I got in the car. And the lady said, You know, you can't park. There's a fire hydrant. And I said, All right, I understand, I had brain surgery, I had my helmet on. And then she says, Yeah, sure. She didn't really believe me. I got in the car, and then, you know, we left. And then I got the mail and the ticket. She didn't even give us a ticket on the windshield or anything. 
- All right, case is dismissed. 
- I appreciate it, Your Honor, thank you. 
- Good luck. How are you feeling? I can't hear you. Speak into the mic. 
- I had brain cancer surgery and then it got infected. So they had to remove the bone, like, the... the skull of my head... Yeah. 
- The skull? So, that's why you're wearing a helmet? 
- Helmet, yes. 
- Yeah? 
- So hopefully in October, I'm good. 
- Okay, we're rooting for you. Good luck. 
- I appreciate it. Thank you. 
- I got divorced from him maybe about six or seven years ago. 
- Yeah. 
- Right before he went to federal prison for 15 years. 
- You're telling me all these bad things about him, but when he comes in, you let him use the car. 
- You're telling me all these bad things about him, It's just a cough. Yeah right. And the earth is flat. Ahhh!! Treat your cough seriously with Robitussin CF Max. Nothing lasts longer and treats more symptoms for your cough, cold and flu. Robitussin. Because it's never just a cough. -We're doing karaoke later, and you're gonna sing. -Jamie, this is your house? -I know, it's not much, but it's home. Right, kids? -Kids? -Papa, Papa! -[ Laughs ] -You didn't tell me your friends were coming. -Oh, yeah. -This one is tiny like a child. -Yeah, she is. Oh, but seriously, it's good to be surrounded by what matters most -
- a home and auto bundle from Progressive. -Oh, sweetie, please, play for us. -Oh, no, I couldn't. -Please. -Okay. [ Singing in Spanish ] 
- Kathy Acosta. Kathy, you have two red light violations. 
- Yeah. I-
- they-
- it wasn't me driving. 
- Who drives? 
- It was my ex-husband. He lives in Puerto Rico. And the first one that he got, he said he paid it. Now I get a second one in the mail. And I'm furious. 
- Are... 
- Um... 
- Are you divorced from this guy? 
- Yes, I am. 
- When did you get divorced? 
- Uh, well... 
- A year ago? Two years ago? Six months ago? When? 
- Oh, I got divorced from him maybe about six or seven years ago. 
- Yeah. 
- Right before he went to federal prison for 15 years. 
- Well... 
- Just to explain what a good citizen he is. 
- Well, the fact of the matter is that the ticket was just issued last month. 
- Yeah. He just left last month. 
- Oh, he's your ex-husband... 
- The first one... 
- He's your ex-husband but you still let him use your car. 
- Well, I try to be fair. 
- I mean, you're telling me all these bad things about him but when he comes in, you let him use the car. 
- True, true. That it... That's against me for being foolish. 
- No, it's not against you. I'm just trying to figure something out. 
- It's because we have a child together. She's grown now, but... 
- Let's take a look at it. Here he goes right through the light, he don't care. Let's look at the other one. 
- Red, there he goes. 
- Yeah, that was a close one. All right, lights, please. Kathy, I think you sufuffer from having a big heart. I think you're just too, uh, kind and... 
- Suffered for a long time. 
- Yeah? 
- I paid my dues. 
- Yeah. I'm gonna dismiss one of these because you're paying. 
- Yeah, but what I wanted to do was to have him pay both of them. 
- Well, here's... 
- But on his license in Puerto Rico. 
- Kathy, when you receive these summonses, on the back of the summons, if you had told us who was driving the car then he would be held responsible. You didn't do that. And the time for that has passed. So, it's too late to do that. I would love to help you. If I could do it I would do it. But it has no, no effect. If you had done it originally, then we would have notified the authorities there, and he would've had a problem. 
- Yeah. 
- Okay. 
- Lesson learned. 
- Good luck to you. Jennifer Cruz. Jennifer, get close to the mic. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- What is your daughter's name? 
- Marleni. 
- What is it? 
- Marleni. 
- She's very well-behaved. 
- Thank you. 
- How old are you, honey? 
- I'm five years old. 
- Five? 
- Do you wanna come up here? 
- Do you wanna go up there? 
- Come up. Okay, you have three tickets. 
- Yes, I don't wish to contend. I was just hoping that you could, um, the late fees, I was hoping that you could... take those off and I'd pay the tickets. 
- Okay. Do you have an excuse for any of these tickets? 
- Um, I know that the, um, the one on South Main Street, I had put just, um, one quarter in because I was just going to get my BCI. And there was, like, 20 people in there waiting so they were backed up. 
- I want-
- I wanna show you something so don't leave yet, okay? 
- Okay. 
- Hold on. Okay, you're gonna help me out with these, okay? 
- Okay. 
- All right, now, I got three choices. And these are the three choices. 
- I can charge your mom number one is $50, right? And number two... is $100. And number three is $150. So, should I charge her number one, number two or number three? 
- Number one, Leni. 
- Oh, no, no, no... Oh, you can't, you can't help her. I'm gonna change it around now, okay? 
- Okay. 
- What do you think? 
- Number one. 
- Number one? Is that because your mom helped you out? It is, huh? I think she cheated a little bit, what do you think? 
- Yes? 
- Oh, she thinks you cheated. Okay, well... I asked you to help me so I'm gonna take your recommendation. It's gonna be $50, okay? 
- Okay. 
- All right, thanks for helping me out. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- Your fine was... 
- Yes. 
- What do you wanna say? 
- First, I'm terribly sorry. 
- No, I don't wanna hear that.

- Francesca? 
- Hello. 
- Your motor vehicle has been booted. 
- Yes. 
- And you came to court on... 
- Last year sometime. 
- November of last year. 
- Yes. 
- Your fine was... 
- Yes. I missed my-
- okay. 
- I told you at that point that I would release the boot if you paid $20 a week... 
- Yeah, that was on my mom's car. 
- For 30 weeks. 
- Yes. 
- Which is $300. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- So, I... said to you that you could pay the $20 a week for 15 weeks and that if you did that that I would dismiss the entire balance of $660. 
- Yes. 
- You solemnly promised that you would do that. Absolutely, thank you, Judge. I will do that every week, and I told you at that point that we have not changed our phone number here. That if there was any reason why you couldn't pay, that you should call. So, you made three payments and never made another payment. 
- I made more than three payments. 
- You made three payments. So... 
- Some of them were for 40. And a few, like, I think, for 60. 
- You made three payments. 
- In January, I got evicted from my apartment, so after that... 
- We haven't changed our phone number. 
- Okay... I'm sorry. 
- So, all I'm telling you is that any representations you made to the court today I will be suspect whether or not you will keep your word because you broke your word last time after I bent over backwards to give you a big break. 
- So, what do you wanna say? 
- First, I'm terribly sorry and... 
- No, I don't wanna hear that. 
- Okay, well, in January, I was-
- I got evicted from my place, and I was going through a lot with my two kids. 
- Listen, the fact that-
- that fact of the matter is that if the car wasn't booted, you wouldn't come down here. You know the car was booted. You know you were saving $620. All you had to do was pay the $20 a week. You didn't do it. You didn't do it, you didn't call. We understand. People call all the time and say, Listen, something happened, I can't pay. We say, Okay. But we... we, at least-
- They at least contact us. But you just didn't contact us. I don't know what you thought. 
- After speaking with the Judge, I wanted 400 in order to release the boot. There's a little issue with that. So, the Judge has said we're gonna release the boot on $200. And we'll put you back on the $20 payment plan. But I can assure you this. If you don't adhere to the $20 payment plan a week, next time you're not gonna get the car back unless it's a substantial amount of money back for the city. So the Judge, once again, is bending completely over. Last time, he bent over backwards. Right now he's head over heels, so... You gotta help the court a little bit. 
- Francesca? 
- Yes. 
- If I followed normal protocol on this you would end up with no car. Because if I don't release the boot, the car will get towed. If the car gets towed, you will then owe all this money which is $1,080. And then you will owe the tow company approximately $100 for the tow. And then they charge storage every day. 
- Yes. 
- So, effectively, what I would be doing is I would be taking your car away from you. I know you have children. I don't wanna do that. But I want you to show some good faith. 
- Yes. 
- Okay, so I'm trying to help you. Now all I'm asking is that you help yourself. 
- Thank you. 
- Inspector Quinn explained to you I'm gonna hold back on having the car towed. I'm gonna leave the boot on until tomorrow. I will be here tomorrow. 
- Okay. 
- Come in and hopefully we can get this resolved. Do you understand that? 
- Yes. 
- All right, good luck to you. 
- Thank you. 
- Gregory Gautier. Good morning, sir. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- You have four tickets, sir. Uh... let's see. Two on Westminster... Exchange and Atwells Avenue. 
- The three most current ones, um, is parked around the streets that surround One Financial Plaza which is where I work. I'm guilty. I had to run in, run out. Sometimes I got delayed, so I'm guilty at that, Your Honor. 
- All right. 
- I was wondering if I could, uh... 
- Waive the penalties? 
- Yes, sir, yes, Your Honor. 
- I think we can do that. 
- The one on Atwells Avenue goes back a few years. And it was, uh, in December. And the, um, it was, uh, around Christmastime. I was up there for lunch and I didn't see the... 
- Where did we have lunch? 
- I-
- what did I have? 
- No, where? 
- Oh, Venda Ravioli, Your Honor. 
- Do you remember what you had? 
- Uh... No, I do not. 
- Judge, if he said corned beef, I was gonna think he was lying. 
- Yeah, that got some pretty good dishes up there. 
- Uh... 
- You know, I mean, they make the ravioli-
- They're homemade. I was born and raised in that area. And many times people will say to me, What's the best Italian restaurant up there? And the answer is there were several good ones. I have a personal preference which I, I don't feel at liberty to, uh, disclose. But Italians really gauge a restaurant on... on their pasta and... And they really-
- and then it goes further than that. They gauge it on their gravy. Now Italians call red sauce, gravy, right? Everyone else, when I talk about gravy, they think I'm talking about something you put on chicken or something over mashed potatoes. Right, Inspector Quinn? 
- No, Your Honor. I'm familiar with the red gravy also. 
- It's obvious. 
- All right. I'm aware of the decorations up there at Christmastime. As a matter of fact... I've often wondered why more tickets don't go out there on the Christmas vacation 'cause they do have decorations all over the place. All right, so I'm gonna dismiss that ticket, it's $90. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- All right, good luck. All right, so I'm gonna dismiss that ticket, it's $90. Got it? Got it. Nooooo... Nooooo... <i>Quick, the Quicker Picker Upper!</i> <i> Bounty picks up messes quicker</i> <i> and is 2x more absorbent.</i> <i> Bounty, the Quicker Picker</i> <i> Upper.</i> If only there was a place nearby you could get one of these. Or these. Good thing they're sold literally everywhere business is done. I'm pretty sure you could buy them at a bank. Not Sorry. Reese's. So, when you leave, you tell him that I was gonna fine him the full amount and that your argument was so compelling, right, that you beat me down, and I dismissed the case. So, that he will owe you, right? Should buy you a nice gift. You can tell him when you leave. 
- Okay. 
- That way you can exaggerate, okay? Are you kidding?
