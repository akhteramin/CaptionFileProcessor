 A HORRIFYING MOMENT CAUGHT ON

 A UTAH WOMAN WAS DRIVING WITH

 THE CHINESE ARE USING OUR OWN
 AMERICAN SATELLITES AGAINST US.
 IT'S A STUNNING NEW REPORT ON
 SATELLITES BUILT BY AMERICANS
 THAT BEIJINGb( USING TO■■ HELP
 ITS POLICE AND SOLDIERS.
 PLUS, LORI LOUGHLIN'S AREAS
 ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO TURN
 OVER THE EVIDENCE.
 HER AND HER HUSBAND FACING THE
 POSSIBILITY OF DECADES BEHIND

 AND NOW BOB SAGET WEIGHING
 IN.
 REPORTING BEGINS NOW.
 AND OUR REPORTING BEGINS WITH
 BREAKING NEWS THIS HOUR.
 HILLARY CLINTON SPEAKING OUT
 ABOUT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT
 MUELLER'S FINAL REPORT ON THE
 RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
 THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE
 AND ONE-TIME CANDIDATE CALLING
 FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO
 RELEASE THE UNREDACTED VERSION
 AND SAVE -AND SAYING THE
 MUELLER REPORT IS JUST THE
 BEGINNING.
 I'M REALLY OF THE MIND THAT
 THE MUELLER REPORT IS PART OF
 THE BEGINNING.
 IT'S NOT THE END.
 MAYBE AS CHURCHILL SAID, IT'S
 THE END OF THE BEGINNING.
 THERE'S STILL SO MUCH MORE THAT
 WE SHOULD KNOW AND THAT WE
 SHOULD ACT UPON.
 OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT THE
 CONGRESS IS TRYING TO FIGURE
 OUT, WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW.
 Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 SON-IN-LAW AND SENIOR ADVISER
 CLAIMED THE RUSSIAN
 INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN MORE
 DAMAGING TO THE UNITED STATES
 THAN PUTIN'S MEDDLING IN THE
 2016 ELECTION.
 JARED KUSHNER SPEAKING PUBLICLY
 FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S
 REDACTED FINAL REPORT CAME OUT
 LAST WEEK.
 JARED KUSHNER SAID HE THOUGHT
 THE WHOLE THING WAS KIND OF
 NONSENSE.
 THAT'S A QUOTE.
 HERE'S WHAT HE SAID TODAY DURING
 THE TIME 100 SUMMIT.
 YOU LOOK AT WHAT RUS DID,
 ACEBOODS ANDTO 7p7p7p7p7p■p■p■p
 NVESTIGATIONS AND ALL OF THE SPECULATION THAT
 HAS HAPPENED THE LAST TWO YEARS
 HAS HAD A MUCH HARSHER IMPACT
 THAN A COUPLE OF FACEBOOK ADS.
 Shepard: JARED KUSHNER'S
 DIMINISHMENT OF RUSSIAN
 INTERFERENCE IS DECEPTIVE.
 FROM THE MUELLER REPORT WE NOW
 KNOW, RUSSIANS MADE CONTACT WITH
 MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING JARED
 KUSHNER AND ATTEMPTING TO
 PROMOTE RUSSIAN OBJECTIVES.
 THEY RECEIVED CAMPAIGN POLLING
 DATA FROM THE TRUMP TEAM AND
 DISCUSSED BUSINESS DEALS AND
 POLICY GOALS AND GETTING DIRT ON
 HILLARY CLINTON WITH THE NOW
 PRESIDENT'S SON AND OTHERS.
 THEY CONDUCTED CYBER ESPIONAGE,
 STEALING E-MAILS AND
 DISTRIBUTING THEM TO HELP
 CANDIDATE TRUMP AND HURT TRUMP'S
 OPPONENT.
 THEY SENT RUSSIAN OPERATIVES IN
 AMERICA IN PERSON TO LEARN THE
 LANDSCAPE AND SOW DIVISION IN
 AMERICA.
 THAT I BROKE INTO STATE AND
 LOCAL ELECTION COMPUTERS AND
 INVADED OUR NATION IN THE CYBER
 AND PHYSICAL WORLDS.
 THE UNITED STATES INDICTED 26
 RUSSIAN NATIONALS AND THREE
 RUSSIAN COMPANIES AND THE
 MUELLER REPORT MAKE CRYSTAL
 CLEAR AND ALL U.S. INTELLIGENCE
 AGENCIES CONCUR THE RUSSIANS ARE
 STILL TRYING TO THING OUR
 NATION, INTERFERE IN OR AFFAIRS
 AND INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS.
 SPECIAL COUNSEL PROSECUTORS
 INTERVIEWED JARED KUSHNER FOR
 HIS CONTACTS WITH THE RUSSIANS
 INCLUDING THE INFAMOUS TRUMP
 TOWER MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP
 JR. AND THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN
 CHAIRMAN, PAUL MANAFORT.
 MUELLER REPORT WHILE THERE'S
 EVIDENCE OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH
 THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND MOSCOW,
 THERE WAS NO COORDINATION.
 ON THE MATTER OF RUSSIAN
 INTERFERENCE, THE FACEBOOK ADS
 JARED KUSHNER REFERENCES WERE
 BUT A SLIVER OFRUSSIA'S ATTACK
 @A.
 JOHN ROBH MORE.
 GOOD AFTERNOON TO A=A=A=A=
 IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAA=A=A==
 SIA=LLERREAA=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A==
 A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A=A
 2016 MEETING AT TRUMP TOWERS.
 IN THE REPORT, MUELLER SUGGESTED
 THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER
 OR NOT THAT MEETING MIGHT HAVE
 CONSTRUED AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN
 CONTRIBUTION FROM A FOREIGN
 SOURCE.
 BUT ULTIMATELY MUELLER'S
 INVESTIGATORS COULD NOT FIGURE
 OUT WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING S
 OPERATIVE WAS
 HERE'S WHAT KUSHNER SAID OR WHAT
 ELSE HE SAID ABOUT THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 WITH THE WHOLE NOTION OF THE
 RUSSIA COLLUSION NARRATIVE CAME
 UP, I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO
 SAY HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE WITH
 ANY INVESTIGATIONS.
 AT THIS POINT, I'VE DOWN THREE
 HOURS INTERVIEWS, NINE HOURS OF
 SPECIAL COUNSEL.
 LOOK AT MANY STATEMENT FROM
 JULY, I PUT OUT ABOUT A 12-PAGE
 STATEMENT EXPLAINING ALL OF
 THESE THINGS.
 EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID IS TRUE
 AND VERY, VERY THOROUGHLY
 INVESTIGATED.
 THE ONE THING THE MUELLER REPORT
 WAS CONCLUSIVE ON IS THERE WAS
 ABSOLUTELY NO COORDINATION ORA==
 GN.
 NOA SAY THATA= THEA=A=A=A=A=A=AO
 ABOUT THE SUBPOENA THATA=A=A=ST
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, GERALDAAAA
 21 FROA=R WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL, DON McGAHN.
 IN A STATEMENT, GERALD NADLER
 SAYING --
 McGAHN MET WITH INVESTIGATORS
 MORE THAN 30 HOURS.
 IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT MORE CONGRESS
 COULD LEARN IN A HEARING THAN
 MUELLER DID IN 30 HOURS OF
 QUESTIONING.
 IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE WHITE
 HOUSE WILL ALLOW McGAHN TO
 TESTIFY OR EXERT EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE.
 MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE THAT
 CLAIM IN A COURT OF LAW.
 THEY DID NOT CLAIM ANY PRIVILEGE
 OVER ANYTHING IN THE MUELLER
 REPORT THAT HAD McGAHN'S NAME ON
 IT.
 THEY ALSO DID NOT ASSERT
 ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND
 NOT ALLOW HIM TO DO AN INTERVIEW
 WITH ROBERT MUELLER.
 PUTTING THE GENIE OF EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE OR ATTORNEY CLIENT
 PRIVILEGE IN THE BOTTLE MAY BE
 DIFFICULT.
 THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE
 COMMITTEE DARRELL ISSA SAID THAT
 HE BELIEVES McGAHN WILL TESTIFY
 BUT WITH A MEMBER OF THE WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL TEAM IN
 ATTENDANCE.
 LISTEN HERE.
 SO BOTTOM LINE IS, DON IS A
 VERY SMART LAWYER.
 HE'S ALREADY TESTIFIED.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OPEN AND
 TRANSPARENT IN THE WAY THE TWO
 PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS WERE NOT.
 SO I EXPECT HIM TO COME BUT I
 INSPECTION HIM TO INSIST ON
 HAVING PEOPLE BEHIND HIM THAT
 CAN ADVISE HIM AS TOHEN
 ANSWER A QUESTION WHEN A
 PRIVILEGE NIGHT BE APAu
 McGAHN HAS BEEN ASKED TO
 PR■■UMENTS B MAY 7.THE TESTIMON
 SCHEDULED FOR MAY 21.
 WE'LL SEE IF GOES.

 SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS THAT THE
 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN
 WILL ANNOUNCE THIS THURSDAY THAT
 HE IS RUNNING FOR THE WHITE
 HOUSE AND MAKE HIS FIRST
 APPEARANCE AS AN OFFICIAL
 CANDIDATE NEXT WEEK ON MONDAY IN
 PITTSBURGH.
 PETER DOOCY REPORTING.
 LIVE IN WASHINGTON.
 PETER?
 JOE BIDEN IS SET TO BECOME
 2020'S 20th CANDIDATE.
 HE WILL EXPLAIN WHY HE'S THE
 BEST BET TO TOPPLE TRUMP.
 HE HEADS TO PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH
 TRUMP WON FOR A CAMPAIGN EVENT
 AT A UNION HALL IN PITTSBURGH ON
 MONDAY.
 HE PLANS TO QUICKLY GO PUBLIC
 WITH A LONG LIST OF HIGH PROFILE
 ENDORSEMENTS.
 THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT
 BARACK OBAMA WHO HE SERVES AS
 V.P. IS READY TO BACK BIDEN.
 THE 76-YEAR-OLD FLIRTED WITH A
 CAMPAIGN IN 2016 AS HILLARY
 CLINTON STRUGGLED AND NEVER
 ANNOUNCED ANYTHING AND
 CONTINUING GRIEVING IF LOSS OF
 HIS SON IN PRIVATE, THIS WILL BE
 BIDEN'S THIRD OFFICIAL BID.
 THE FIRST IN 1988,
 HE BOUGHED OUT BEFORE THE
 CAUCUSES AMID A PLAGIARISM.
 THE NEXT TIME HE RAN, HE BOUGHED
 OUT AFTER A POOR SHOWING IN THE
 IOWA CAUCUSES.
 BOWDEN HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
 MAKING WOMEN FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
 WITH TOUCHING AND KISSING.
 NOBODY ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL
 ASSAULT AND THE ALLEGATIONS
 DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE IMPACTED
 HIS EFFORT IN ANY WAY.
 THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT COMMENTS
 BIDEN MADE IN UKRAINE WHERE HE
 JOKED ABOUT PRESSURING A
 UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL THAT WAS
 INVESTIGATING A COMPANY HIS SON
 WORKED FOR.
 IT'S ALL PART OF A DECADES LONG
 REPORT THAT IS ABOUT TO BE
 RE-VISITED.
 SHEP?
 Shepard: THANKS.
 THE DEBATE ABOUT TRYING TO
 IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
 SPILLED OVER IN THE CAMPAIGN
 TRAIL.
 THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
 GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY
 SUPPORT CONGRESS MOVING FORWARD
 WITH IMPEACHMENT LAST NIGHT ON
 TOWN HALL MEETINGS ON CNN.
 NANCY PELOSI IS URGING HER PARTY
 TO HOLD OFF ON THOSE EFFORTS AND
 FOCUS ON INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE
 PRESIDENT, HIS CAMPAIGN AND
 BUSINESSES TO AS SHE PUTS IT TO
 SEE WHERE THE FACTS LEAD.
 THAT'S ACCORDING TO SOURCES
 BRIEFED ON A CONFERENCE CALL LED
 BY SPEAKER PELOSI LAST NIGHT.
 PETER, SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S TESTING
 THE WATERS WITH THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE BEFORE JUMPING IN HEAD
 FIRST.
 AND SO ARE MULTIPLE DEMOCRATS
 HOPING TO REPLACE PRESIDENT
 TRUMP AT THE BALLOT BOX WHO ARE
 ADVOCATING FOR CONGRESS TO
 IMPEACHMENT BEFORE THAT.
 I BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON
 IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE
 OUGHT TO HAVE TO VOTE AND TO SAY
 EITHER YEAH, THAT'S OKAY WITH
 ME.
 YEAH, LET HIM STEP IN THE WAY HE
 DID WHEN HE TOLD THE WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL TO GO FIRE MUELLER.
 I THINK WE HAVE VERY GOOD
 REASON TO BELIEVE THERE'S AN
 INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN
 CONDUCTED WHICH HAS PRODUCED
 EVIDENCE THAT TELLS US THAT THIS
 PRESIDENT ABOUT HIS
 ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED IN
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE
 THE STEP TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT.
 JOE BIDEN SAID HE DIDN'T WANT
 ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT UNTIL AFTER THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 WE'LL SEE IF HE CHANGED HIS MIND
 SOON, SHEP.
 Shepard: PETER, THERE'S THE
 DEBATE ON FELONS VOTING.
 BERNIE SANDERS DEFENDING HIS
 POSITION THAT ALL FELONS SHOULD
 BE ALLOWED TO VOTE.
 HE TOLD A CROWD FROM NEW
 ENGLAND THAT HE THINKS THE
 BOSTON BOMBER SHOULD VOTE FROM
 PRISON, TOO, A FEW DAYS AFTER
 THE REGION MARKED THE SIXTH
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARATHON
 ATTACKS.
 MY FOLLOW QUESTION GOES TO
 THIS LIKE YOU'RE WRITING AN
 OPPOSITION AD AGAINST YOU.
 YOU THINK THE BOSTON MARATHON
 BOMBER SHOULD VOTE NOT AFTER HE
 PAYS HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY BUT
 WHILE HE'S IN JAIL.
 YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
 CHRIS, I THINK I HAVE WRITTEN
 MANY 30-SECOND OPPOSITION ADS
 THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.
 LATER AGREED, SHE SAID SHE
 SUPPORTS HAVING A CONVERSATION
 ABOUT THAT.
 PETER DOOCY LIVE IN
 WASHINGTON.
 THANKS.

 Shepard: FOX URGENT. FOR THE FIRST TIMEL
 IVES■■■■■■■■■A@AIIIN CHARGES IN
 THE OPIOID CRISIS.
 FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SAY A FORMER
 DRUG COMPANY CEO INSTRUCTED HIS
 STAFF TO IGNORE RED FLAGS,
 INCLUDING SUSPICIOUSLY LARGE
 ORDERS FROM PHARMACIES THAT
 SUPPLY PILL MILLS.
 PLACES WHERE PATIENTS COULD GET
 MANY MORE PAINKILLERS THAN THEY
 NEEDED.
 THE FORMER EXECUTIVE'S NAME IS
 LARRY DOWD.
 HERE'S HIS RETIREMENT
 ANNOUNCEMENT.
 HE WORKED FOR ROCHESTER DRUG
 COOPERATIVE WHICH DISTRIBUTED
 OXYCODONE AND FENTANYL.
 HIS FORMER CHIEF COMPLIANCE
 OFFICER IS ALSO FACING CHARGES.
 THE FORMER CEO'S ATTORNEY SAID
 THAT MR. DOWD IS BEING FRAYED BY
 OTHERS TO COVER UP FOR THEIR
 WRONG DOING.
 THE GOVERNMENT HAS IT ALL WRONG
 AND IS BEING USED AN MANIPULATED
 BY PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A
 SCAPEGOAT.
 DOUD WILL DEFEND THESE CHARGES
 TO HIS LAST BREATH AND WILL BE
 VINDICATED.
 THE COMPANY ITSELF IS ADMITTING
 IT "MADE MISTAKES."
 ROCHESTER DRUG COOPERATIVE
 SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANY HAS
 REACHED A CRIMINAL AND CIVIL
 SETTLEMENT DEAL WITH PROSECUTORS
 AGREEING TO PAY A $20 MILLION
 FINE AND LAUNCH A COMPLIANCE
 PROGRAM.
 LET'S TURN TO KATIE.
 SHE'S A FORMER FEDERAL
 PROSECUTOR AND NOW A CRIMINAL
 DEFENSE ATTORNEY.
 THE FEDERAL CHARGES ARE NEW, BUT
 THE PAY THE PENALTY AND YOU'RE
 SCOT-FREE, THIS IS A PART OF A
 PATTERN, ISN'T IT?
 IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
 THERE'S BEEN CIVIL ENFORCEMENTS
 AGAINST THESE PHARMACEUTICAL
 COMPANIES FOR A LONG TIME.
 THE CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT IS A
 NEW THING AND PROBABLY LONG
 OVERDO YOU FOR THE FOLKS THAT
 ARE RESPONSIBLE AT THE TOP END
 FOR THIS OPIOID CRISIS.
 WHAT IS THIS EXECUTIVE AND
 HIS COMPLIANCE OFFICER, WHAT ARE
 THE TWO OF THEM BEING CHARGED
 WITH AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO
 THEM UPON CONVICTION, IF IT
 HAPPENS?
 THEY'RE BEING CHARGED UNDER
 THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT,
 WHICH ESSENTIALLY PLACES A LOT
 OF RESPONSIBILITY ON
 DISTRIBUTORS OF DANGEROUS DRUGS
 TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MAKING
 SURE THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE
 USING THEM FOR LEGITIMATE
 PERSONS.
 SO THEY'RE CHARGED WITH
 CONSPIRACIES TO ILLEGALLY
 DISTRIBUTE THESE SUBSTANCES TO
 PHARMACIES THAT THEY NEW HAD RED
 FLAGS AND SELLING THESE DRUGS
 ELICITLY.
 SO FOR THE FOLKS FIGHTING THE
 CHARGES, THEY CAN FACE A
 SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JAIL TIME.
 THERE'S BEEN A SETTLEMENT
 AGREEMENT REACHED FOR SOME OF
 THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED THAT IS
 A DEFERRED PROSECUTION.
 SO THEY WILL NOT BE IMMEDIATELY
 FACING THAT ASSUMING THEY
 SUPPLY.
 FOR THOSE FIGHTING IT ALL THE
 WAY THROUGH, THIS COULD BE
 SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES ON THE
 CIVIL SIDE AND CRIMINAL SIDE.
 Shepard: THE CHARGES MIRROR
 THE KIND OF CHARGES THAT A DRUG
 KINGPIN WOULD FACE.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK IT'S VERY LONG OVERDUE.
 THERE'S PEOPLE THAT SELL THESE
 DRUGS IN SMALL AMOUNTS ON THE
 STREETS AND THEY FACE JAIL TIME
 WITHOUT QUESTION.
 THESE FOLKS AT THE
 PHARMACEUTICAL QUESTIONS ARE
 DOING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME
 THING.
 BUT FROM A CORPORATE
 PERSPECTIVE.
 ON THE DEFENSE SIDE, YOU CAN
 LOOK AT IT AND SAY THEY'RE NOT
 DIRECTLY DISTRIBUTING.
 THEY'RE BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE
 FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS.
 BUT THAT'S PART OF ENGAGING IN
 BUSINESS AND SELLING A DANGEROUS
 PROTECT.
 YOU'RE HELD TO A HIGH STANDARD.
 THAT'S WHY THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE
 FOR THAT, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
 NOT DIRECTLY SELLING THE DRUGS.
 THANKS SO MUCH.
 I APPRECIATE IT.
 THE NEW CHARGES ARE OUT.
 WE'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON WHAT
 HAPPENS NEXT.
 NOW, COMING UP, DOZENS OF FOLKS
 SAY THAT THEY WERE RECORDED
 WHILE GETTING MASSAGED IN THE
 SPA IN THE ROBERT KRAFT
 PROSTITUTION STING.
 THEY SAID THEY DID NOTHING WRONG
 AND THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE

 THE EVIDENCE THE GOVERNMENT H
 AGAINST HER IN THE COLLEGE
 ADMISSIONS CANDLE.
 SHE, OF COURSE, IS THE ACTRESS
 LORI LOUGHLIN AND HER FASHION
 DESIGNER HUSBAND.
 JOINING A DOZEN OTHER DEFENDANTS
 ASKING FOR THE FEDS TO TURN IT
 OVER, ALL THE EVIDENCE.
 THEY CLAIM THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY
 OF IT AND THEY NEED A CHANCE TO
 REVIEW IT.
 PROSECUTORS SAY THE FULL HOUSE
 STAR AND HER HUSBAND PAID
 $500,000 TO BRIBE THEIR
 DAUGHTER'S WAY INTO THE
 UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
 CALIFORNIA.
 THEY PLEADED NOT GUILTY EARLIER
 THIS MONTH.
 TRACE GALLAGHER HAS MORE.
 THE EVIDENCE IS KEY.
 LOUGHLIN AND HER HOUSE ARE
 FACING MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES
 FOR FUNNELING THE $500,000 BRIBE
 THROUGH THE RINGLEADER'S CHARITY
 AND THE WIRE FRAUD CHANGES
 BECAUSE SOME OF THE MONEY WAS
 T IN OUTSIDE THE UNITED
 STATES.
 THE CHARGES INDICATE THE FEDS
 HAVE THINGS LIKE BANK RECORDS,
 CASH CHECKS, WIRE TRANSFERS,
 ET CETERA.
 FOR NOW, LOUGHLIN AND HER
 HUSBAND HAVE PLEADED■ GUILTY
 BECAUSE THE PLEA DEAL INCLUDES
 SIGNIFICANT JAIL TIME UP TO FOUR
 YEARS.
 THEY INITIALLY PASSED ON A MORE
 LENIENT PLEA DEAL AND ANOTHER
 CHARGE WAS ADDED.
 EXPERTS SAY THE COUPLE'S
 ATTORNEYS WILL NEED TO SEE HOW

 LOUGHLIN IS REPORTEDLY CONCERNED
 THAT HER DAUGHTERS MIGHT BE
 CHARGED AS WILLING PARTICIPANTS

 SOMETHING WAS UP.

 TALKING.
 HE'S NOT SAYING MUCH.
 HE'S WORKED OR "FULL HOUSE" WITH
 LOUGHLIN FOR EIGHT YEARS.
 WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE

 Shepard: THE SUPREME COURT HEARING ARGUMENTS ON WHETHER THE
 2020 CENSUS SHOULD ASK PEOPLE IF
 THEY'RE LEGAL CITIZENS OF THE

 WHICH LEAD TO AN INACCURATE

 SOME AREAS LOSING SEATS IN
 CONGRESS AND LOSING FEDERAL
 FUNDING.
 ACCORDING TO OUR TEAM IN THE
 COURTROOM, THE ARGUMENTS WERE AT
 TIMES HEATED.
 SELF JUSTICES INTERCEPTED

 CHINA IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
 AMERICAN-MADE SATELLITES USING
 THOSE SATELLITES FOR EVERYTHING
 FROM SPREADING CHINESE STATE
 MESSAGES TO HELPING CHINESE
 POLICE CRACK DOWN ON
 ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS.
 ANALYSTS WARN BEIJING'S MILITARY
 COULD USE THE UNITED STATES
 TECHNOLOGY TO GUIDE CHINESE
 MISSILES TO THEIR TARGETS.
 ALL OF THAT ACCORDING TO AN
 INVESTIGATION BY THE "WALL
 STREET JOURNAL."
 THE JOURNAL'S PARENT COMPANY AND
 FOX NEWS SHARE COMMON OWNERSHIP.
 THERONES THAT BAN CHINA
 FROM BUYING U.S.-BIT SATELLITES.
 ACCORDING TO THE REPORTING OF
 THE JOURNAL, THERE'S NO LAW
 REGULATING USE OF OUR SATELLITES
 FREQUENCIES.
 SO CHINA IS ESSENTIALLY RENTING
 OUR SERVICES IN SPACE AND COULD
 POTENTIALLY USE THEM AGAINST US.
 LET'S BRING IN KATE O'KEEFE, A
 REPORTER FOR THE "WALL STREET
 JOURNAL."
 KATE, THANK YOU.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 FOR THOSE THAT UNDERSTAND
 SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY, IT'S LIKE
 A BUNCH OF WINDOWS ON THE
 SATELLITE.
 YOU CAN USE THEM TO BOUNCE
 THINGS OFF.
 INFORMATION AND OTHERWISE.
 WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE CHINESE
 CAPABLE OF DOING WITH OUR
 SATELLITES?
 WHAT WE FOUND IN THIS
 INVESTIGATION IS THAT CHINA IS
 BASICALLY MAKING USE OF A FLEET
 OF U.S.-MADE SATELLITES TO
 ACHIEVE STRATEGIC GOALS THAT RUN
 COUNTER TO U.S. FOREIGN POLICY.
 IN ONE CASE, WE FOUND CHINA WAS
 USING SOME OF THESE SATELLITES
 TO CONNECT CHINESE MILITARY
 UNCONTESTED OUTPOSTS IN THE
 SOUTH CHINA SEA.
 IN OTHER CASES, WE FOUND THE
 SATELLITES WERE BEING USED BY
  TO BOLSTER THEIR POLICE
 FORCES IN REGIONS LIKE TIBET
 WHERE INTERNATIONAL GROUPS HAVE
 DOCUMENTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.
 HAS THE UNITED STATES WEIGHED
 IN ON THIS?
 SO ONE INTERESTING THING
 ABOUT THIS PROJECT THAT WE
 LEARNED IS THAT ALL OF THIS
 ACTUALLY APPEARS TO BE LEGAL
 BECAUSE THE U.S. BANS AMERICAN
 COMPANIES FROM DIRECTLY SELLING
 SATELLITES TO CHINA.
 THERE'S NO REGULATION ON HOW THE
 SATELLITE IS USED IN SPACE.
 SO THAT'S A REALLY WORK AROUND
 THAT CHINA HAS FOUND THAT HAS
 ENABLED THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
 OF THIS U.S. TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT
 ACTUALLY BUYING IT.
 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR CHINA.
 THEIR SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY IS
 INFERIOR TO U.S. TECHNOLOGIES.
 Shepard: UNDERSTANDING THE
 LAW, HAS THE UNITED STATES
 COMMENTED ON THE FACT THAT THIS
 IS HAPPENING?
 DO WE KNOW IF THE U.S. WAS
 AWARE?
 U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN
 AWARE OF THIS GENERAL DYNAMIC
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE APPROVED THE
 EXPORT LICENSES FOR THESE
 COMPANIES.
 Shepard: IT'S A FASCINATING
 ARTICLE.
 KATE O'KEEFE FOR THE "WALL
 STREET JOURNAL," OUR CORPORATE
 COUSIN.
 YOU CAN READ IT NOW AT WSJ.COM.
 THANKS.
 THE PRIME MINISTER OF SRI LANKA
 IS WARNING THAT MORE EXPLOSIVES
 AND MORE ATTACKERS ARE STILL OUT
 THERE AFTER SUICIDE BOMBERS
 KILLED MORE THAN 320 PEOPLE ON
 EASTER SUNDAY.
 ISIS NOW CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY
 FOR THE BOMBINGS.
 SRI LANKAN OFFICIALS SAY THEY
 HAD SUSPECTED LINKS TO THE
 RROR GROUP.
 THE COUNTRY'S DEFENSE MINISTER
 SUGGESTS THAT THE ATTACKS WERE
 IN RESPONSE TO LAST MONTH'S
 MOSQUE ATTACKS IN NEW ZEALAND.
 HE DIDN'T OFFER EVIDENCE TO
 SUPPORT THAT.
 MORE IN JUST A MOMENT.
 FIRST, TAKE LOOK AT THIS VIDEO
 NEW TO IT.
 IT SHOWS THE SUSPECTED BOMBER
 WALKING OVER TO THE
 ST. SEBASTIAN CHURCH NORTH OF
 COLUMBO.
 THAT IS THE CHURCH THAT YOU JUST
 SAW.
 YOU CAN SEE HE'S WEARING A
 BACKPACK HERE.
 AS HE MAKES HIS W■4 TO THE
 CHURCH PACKED WITH LOTS OF
 PEOPLE.
 INVESTIGATORS SAY THE ATTACKS
 KILLED PEOPLE FROM 12 COUNTRIES
 AND 45 ■■■.
 A SPOKESPERSON CONFIRMED FOUR
 AMERICANS ARE AMONG THE DEAD.
 SRI LANKA ON THE STATE OF THE
 EMERGENCY ALLOWING THE MILITARY
 TO ENFORCE ITS WARTIME POWERS.
 OFFICIALS CAN SEARCH PROPERTY
 WITHOUT A WARRANT.
 THERE'S A CURFEW IN EFFECT.
 NO MOVEMENT OVERNIGHT.
 EVEN BEFORE CURFEW, A REPORTER
 FOUND THE STREETS OF SRI LANKA'S
 CAPITOL NEARLY DESERTED.
 A LOT OF FEAR IN SRI LANKA.
 A LOT OF SECURITY INCLUDING WHAT
 YOU SEE AT THIS HOTEL.
 THAT'S THE CASE ACROSS THE CITY
 OF COLUMBO, SRI LANKA'S CAPITOL.
 Shepard: THE PRIME MINISTER
 SAYS PEOPLE WILL LIKELY LOSE
 THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF
 INTELLIGENCE FAILURES.
 CATHERINE HERRIDGE REPORTING ON
 ALL OF THIS LIVE FROM
 WASHINGTON.
 CATHERINE?
 WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CLAIMING
 RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE
 DAY, BEGINNING WITH THE TERROR'S
 OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCY.
 THAT READS --
  THIS STATEMENT DID NOT OFFER
 EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THE CLAIM
 AND THERE'S NO DIRECT EVIDENCE
 THE TERROR GROUP WAS INVOLVED.
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE UNLIKE
 AL-QUAIDA, ISIS HAS MADE FALSE
 CLAIMS IN THE PAST.
 ABOUT THREE HOURS LATER, A
 SECOND CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY
 CAME IN LISTING SEVEN
 INDIVIDUALS AND IDENTIFYING THEM
 AS BOMBERS AS WELL AS THEIR
 ALLEGED TARGETS.
 FINALLY AN HOUR AGO, ANOTHER
 CLAIM INCLUDING ALLEGED VIDEO OF
 THE ATTACKERS SWEARING LOYALTY
 TO ISIS'S LEADER WHOSE
 WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN IN IRAQ.
 TOM JOHNSON WRITES ABOUT
 AL-QUAIDA AND TOLD FOX NEWS THAT
 THE VIDEO IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE
 IT MAY BE THE ATTACKS WERE MORE
 THAN INSPIRED BY ISIS.
 Shepard: CATHERINE, A
 SRI LANKAN OFFICIAL SAID THIS
 WAS A RETALIATION FOR THE
 SHOOTING AT MOSQUES IN
 NEW ZEALAND.
 DO YOU HAVE DETAILS?
 THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIO
 ATTACKS■ WERE RETALIATION FOR T
 NEW ZEALAND BOMBINGS AT MOSQUES.
 THE LAST 48  ATT ■■■/97S/■/
 BEARS THE HALL M■ Np■>G>■>ISIS .
 IT WAS ATTACKS ON PLACES OF■
 WORSHIP, TOURIST SITES WHICH
 DAMAGE THE ECONOMY.
 THIS MORNING THE SRI LANKAN
 PRIME MINISTER SEEMED TO QUALIFY
 THOSE DEFENSE SECRETARY'S
 COMMENTS SAYING IT WAS POSSIBLE
 THE ATTACKS WERE LINKED AND
 EMPHASIZED THE LIKELY ROLE OF
 EXTERNAL FORCES.
 WE HAVE NEWS COMING IN FROM
 CAIRO THAT IS SUPERIOR HAS
 CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY.
 ALL THAT WE KNEW EARLIER.
 NEW ZEALAND'S PRIME MINISTER
 HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT
 THIS CONNECTION SAYING THE
 INVESTIGATION IS IN ITS EARLIER
 STAGES AND HAS NOT SEEN
 INTELLIGENCE THAT SUPPORT THAT
 CONCLUSION OR THE THAT LINK,
 SHEP.
 Shepard: THANKS, CATHERINE.

 Shepard: THE TWO BROTHERS THAT SAY JUSSIE SMOLLETT PAID
 THEM TO STAGE A HATE CRIME
 ATTACK ARE SUING THE ACTOR'S
 ATTORNEYS FOR DEFAMATION.
 I SAID THEIR NAMES WRONG BEFORE
 THE COMMERCIAL.
 THEY'RE THEU%■áNN■
 SMOLLETT'S LEGAL TEAM HAS
 INSISTED THE ATTACK WAS REAL
 EVEN THOUGH THE OSUNDAIRO
 BROTHERS CONFESSED TO POLICE AND
 TOLD A GRAND JURY THAT SMOLLETT
 ORCHESTRATED THE WHOLE THING.
 THE BROTHER'S LAWSUIT CLAIMS
 THAT SMOLLETT'S LAWYERS MADE
 FALSE AND VICIOUS REMARKS ABOUT
 THEM INCLUDING THEY WORE WHITE
 FACE WHEN THEY ATTACKED THE
 ACTOR.
 WE WANT TO END THESE
 MALICIOUS ATTACKS AND ENSURE
 THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR
 CONTINUING TO DESTROY THE
 REPUTATION OF THE CHICAGO POLICE
 DEPARTMENT, THE CITY OF CHICAGO
 AND THAT OF THE OSUNDAIRO
 BROTHERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
 Shepard: SMOLLETT HAS
 ADMITTED THAT HE DID WRITE A
 CHECK TO THE BROTHERS, BUT HE
 CLAIMS THAT CHECK WAS FOR A
 NUTRITION AND WORKOUT SERVICE.
 MIKE TOBIN REPORTING FROM
 CHICAGO.
 WE JUST HEARD FROM SMOLLETT'S
 ATTORNEY ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT,
 RIGHT?
 YEAH, MARK GARRAGOS CAME OUT
 SWINGING.
 HERE'S THE STATEMENT.
 NOW, THE BROTHERS DO ADMIT THAT THEY EXECUTED THE ATTACK
 BUT CLAIM THE HOAX WAS CONCEIVED
 AND DIRECTED BY JUSSIE SMOLLETT.
 THEIR ATTORNEYS SAY THEY'RE JUST
 TRYING TO CLEAR THEIR NAME.
 THEY WERE ASKED TO DO
 SOMETHING BY A FRIEND THEY
 TRUSTE AT THE END OF THE
 DAY, THE FRIEND NAMED THE TRUTH.
 THE SUIT DOES NOT NAME JUSSIE
 SMOLLETT.
 IT CLAIMS THE OSUNDAIRO BROTHERS
 THAT SAID THAT THINGS THAT
 WEREN'T TRUE AND THAT THEY
 EXECUTED A HATE CRIME OR WORE
 WHITE FACE.
 THE BROTHERS CLAIM THEIR
 PERSONAL TRAINING BUSINESS WAS
 DAMAGED, THEY SUFFERED EMOTIONAL
 DISTRESS AND THAT IS ACCORDING
 TO THE SUIT, SHEP.
 Shepard: MIKE, WHAT SORT OF
 DAMAGES ARE THEY SEEKING?
 AN UNSPECIFIED NOTHING.
 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR PUNITIVE

 THAT'S WHAT ELON MUSK SAID.
 HE HOSTED AN INVESTOR DAY
 YESTERDAY TRYING TO WOO
 INVESTORS AND HE SPOKE TO
 SEVERAL OF THEM.
 LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
 ABOUT THIS BOLD PROMISE.
 WE HAVE CARS BEING PRODUCED
 RIGHT NOW AND HAVE EVERYTHING
 NECESSARY FOR FULL SELF-DRIVING.
 ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS IMPROVE
 THE SOFTWARE.
 THERE YOU HAVE IT.
 JUST THE SOFTWARE.
 IT'S A COMPLETE OF CARS CALLED
 ROBO TAXIS.
 HE'S MADE SOME BOLD PROMISES IN
 THE PAST.
 IN 2018, TESLA PROMISED 500,000
 VEHICLES.
 THEY PRODUCED AFTER THAT.
 LAST YEAR, THEY SAID 10,000
 MODEL 3S PER WEEK BUT THEY
 HAVEN'T CUT CLOSE TO THAT
 NUMBER.
 SO YOU HAVE TESLA AS A HOLD
 MAKING BOLD PROMISES AND
 INCLUDING THEY CREATED THE
 WORLD'S FASTEST COMPUTER FOR

 VERY GOOD.
 ITS A BIG BOUNCY BALL FOR TESLA.
