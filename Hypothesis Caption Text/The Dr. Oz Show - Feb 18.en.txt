 GROCERY STORE STEAK. SO MANY CUTS TO CHOOSE FROM.
 WE ARE GOING BEHIND THE
 BUTCHER'S COUNTER.
 YOU COULD SLICE YOUR MEAT IN
 HALF IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK
 FOR.
 ARE YOU GETTING THE BIGGEST
 BANG FOR YOUR BUCK?
 WHAT DO YOU FEEL THAT MOMENT
 YOU PRESS CLICK?
 ARE YOU ADDICTED TO ONLINE
 SHOPPING?
 YOU ARE SPENDING BETWEEN
 $3,000 AND $4,000 A MONTH.
 AFFECTING YOUR BRAIN THE WAY
 DRUGS DO.
 COMING UP NEXT.
 DR. OZ: ARE YOU READY FOR SEASON 10!
 AUDIENCE: YEAH!
 I LOVE YOU, DR. OZ.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: STEAK.
 EVERYONE LOVES IT.
 IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE FOR THE
 WEALTHY.
 BUT SOME OF YOU ARE BEING OVER
 CHARGED FOR BEEF CUTS AT THE
 SUPERMARKET.
 IS THIS THERE IS MEAT
 CONSPIRACY GOING ON AT YOUR
 LOCAL GROCERY STORY.
 BRIAN IS TAKING US BEHIND THE
 SWINGING DOORS TO REVEAL
 SECRETS.
 WE WANT OUR BEST BANG FOR THE
 BUCK.
 MEAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS
 DESIRABLE.
 WHAT IS THE FIRST TIP TO MAKE
 SURE IT GOES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
 THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS
 GET TO KNOW THE BUTCHER.
 ASK THEM WHICH CUTS OF MEAT
 THEY LIKE.
 I GUARANTEE YOU THEY ARE NOT
 THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES IN THE
 CASE.
 THEY CAN TELL YOU WHICH TO CUT
 AND WHAT IS THE BEST VALUE FOR
 THAT DAY.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS A TYPICAL WAY A
 BUTCHER CAN SAVE YOU MONEY?
 WHEN YOU ARE BUYING A ROAST,
 TELL THEM TO TRIM OFF THE
 EXCESS FAT AND BONE SO YOU ARE
 JUST PAYING FOR THE MEAT THAT
 YOU EAT.
 NOT EVERYBODY WILL DO THIS, BUT
 YOU CAN ASK THEM WHAT IT WILL
 DELIVER.
 DR. OZ: I NEVER THOUGHT OF
 ASKING FOR THAT.
 WHY PAY FOR BONE UNITED STATES
 YOU HAVE A PET.
 COUPONS, ANOTHER GREAT MONEY
 SAVING TIPS FOR ANYONE BUYING
 STEAKS.
 WHAT IS THE SECRET?
 THE SECRET IS MORNING MEAT
 MARK-DOWNS.
 LET ME TELL WAS THAT IS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 YES.
 NOW, YOU GO TO YOUR SUPERMARKET
 BETWEEN 8:00 A.M. AND 9:00 A.M.
 THEY ARE GOING TO BE MARKING
 DOWN MEAT.
 IT IS GOING TO BE 50% OFF,
 MAYBE 40% OFF.
 I CALL THEM MY MORNING MEAT
 MARK-DOWNS.
 CALL YOUR BUTCHER, CALL YOUR
 SUPERMARKET AHEAD OF TIME AND
 SAY LISTEN, WHAT TIME ARE YOU
 PUTTING THAT MEAT OUT?
 IT IS ON SALE.
 THAT IS A TIP.
 THAT IS AMAZING.
 YOU SEE HOW THIS IS $7:30?
 IT IS DOWN TO $4.10.
 DR. OZ: I HAD NO IDEA THEY HAVE
 EVER MARKED IT DOWN.
 I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER GONE
 GROCERY SHOPPING AT 8:00 OR
 9:00 IN THE MORNING.
 WHEN YOU ARE A COUPONER LIKE
 ME YOU DO.
 DR. OZ: AND THAT IS A RIBEYE
 STAKE?
 YES.
 NO PROBLEM.
 DR. OZ: PUT YOUR BUTCHER HAT ON
 AND TEACH US.
 THEY HAVE LABELS ON THEM.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO
 CHECK OUT IS THE LABEL.
 YOU LOOK FOR THE GRADE.
 PRIME, CHOSE AND SELECT.
 SELECT IS THE LOWEST GRADE AND
 YOU USUALLY DON'T SEE THAT.
 PRIME IS THE HIGHEST CHOICE.
 IT COMES WITH A HIGH PRICE TAG.
 WHAT YOU WANT TO GET IS CHOICE.
 IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR,
 IT CAN BE JUST AS GOOD AS A
 PRIME STEAK.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR?
 THE MARBLING ON THE STEAK,
 THE FAT WITHIN THE MEAT.
 THESE STRIPS OF FAT IN HERE,
 THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO GET.
 IF YOU HAD THREE STEAKS ALL
 SIMILAR CUTS, YOU WANT TO GET
 THE ONE WITH MOST MARBLING IN
 IT.
 AS THAT STEAK COOKS, THAT FAT
 MELTS, AND IT IS GOING TO GIVE
 YOU A GREATER PERCEPTION OF
 JEWELSINESS AND TENDERNESS AND
 IT WILL BE MORE FLAVORFUL.
 DR. OZ: IF I WANTED A LOW FAT
 MEAL, I COULD GET A SLIGHTLY
 MARBLED CUT?
 OR IT TASTES LIKE RUBBER?
 NO.
 IT DEPENDS ON WHICH CUT YOU
 BUY.
 DR. OZ: THE NEXT AFFORDABLE
 CAN'T THING YOU CAN DO IS FIND
 A STEAK THAT YOU CAN DO.
 SHE AS HER FAMILY LOVES A GREAT
 STEAK DINNER.
 WHAT KIND OF STEAK DO YOU GET
 TO FEED A FAMILY OF FIVE?
 I LIKE TO GET RIBEYE STAKE.
 IT IS THE BEST TYPE OF STEAK.
 I HAVE TRIED OTHER MEATS.
 IT COMES OUT TASTING TOUGH AND
 CAN GET EXPENSIVE.
 DR. OZ: I LOVE RIBEYE, AND IT
 IS PRICEY.
 BRIAN HAS SOMETHING ELSE, THE
 TASTIEST MIKE GOLIC ECONOMICAL
 CHOICE.
 HE IS BRINGING IT TO YOU.
 WHAT IS THIS CALLED?
 THIS IS A TRI-TIP.
 IT IS CUT RIGHT FROM THE
 SIRLOIN OF THE SATERI.
 IT HAS A NICE INCH OF
 INTRAMUSCULAR FAT.
 IT COMES IN A CHUNK.
 IF YOU SLICE IT THIN, VERY
 TENDER.
 DR. OZ: YOU BE THE JUDGE.
 I TRUST THE BUTCHER, BUT I
 TRUST THE MOM MORE.
 YES.
 IT IS VERY TENDER.
 DR. OZ: WOULD IT REPLACE YOUR
 RIBEYE?
 I THINK SO.
 DR. OZ: IF THE TESTER, WE WILL
 SEE IF IT IS ECONOMICAL.
 THE RIBEYE THAT SHE USED TO BUY
 WOULD COST HER ABOUT $70 TO
 FEED A FAMILY OF FIVE.
 THE TRI-TIP CAN FEED THE SAME
 FAMILY FOR $40.
 ENJOY.
 DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE
 FANCY NAMES.
 ASHEVILLE AND JOY ARE HERE WITH

 THEY ARE TELLING US WHAT THEY
 ARE EATING.
 WHAT DO YOU ORDER WHEN YOU GO
 OUT FOR A MALE?
 WELL, I LOVE A NILES FILLET
 MIGNOT, GRASS FEED.
 DR. OZ: THAT WOULD PROBABLY
 COST YOU A LITTLE BUILT.
 YOU HAVE STEAKS IN FRONT OF YOU
 THAT ARE NOT GRASS FED FILLETS.
 I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THEM.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS?
 IT IS JUICY.
 IT TASTES LIKE IT HAS BEEN
 MARINATED FOR A WHILE TOO.
 JOEY, YOUR THOUGHT?
 IT IS NICE.
 SUCCULENT, DR. OZ.
 DR. OZ: SUCCULENT.
 TAKE OFF YOUR BLINDFOLDS.
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 REVEAL WHAT THEY JUST HAD.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT
 BEEF TENDERLOIN AND FIEN A.L.
 MIGNOT IS THE BEST COURTS.
 IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH FLAVOR
 AS OTHER CUTS.
 I HAVE REPLACED THAT TENDERLOIN
 WITH A HANGER STEAK.
 IF YOU SLICE IT AGAINST THE
 GREEN, IT HAS A LOT OF BEEFY
 FLEAFER AND JUICE TOO.
 DELICIOUS.
 DR. OZ: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BREAK
 THE BANK.
 I LOVE EATING THIS AT HOME
 BALLS IT DOESN'T BREAK THE
 BANK.
 THIS STEAK HERE IS A FLAT
 IRON.
 DR. OZ: THEY ARE DIFFERENT?
 YES.
 THIS IS THE CUT I LIKE TO THINK
 REPLACES THE PORTERHOUSE.
 VERY JUICY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 DR. OZ: HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
 WE OVER PAY FOR MEAT?
 DO YOU THINK WE COULD
 HASSELBECK OUR MEAT BILL?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 YOU COULD SLICE YOUR MEAT BILL
 IN HALF IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO
 LOOK GO.
 DR. OZ: WE ARE CONTINUE AFTER
 BREAK.
 CHEF BRIAN IS GOING TO REVEAL
 THE CHEAPEST TASTIEST STEAK IN
 THE SUPERMARKET AND SHOW YOU
 HOW TO PREPARE IT LIKE A PRO.
 YOU WILL NOT WANT TO MISS THIS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DID YOU KILL TRAVIS ALEXANDER?
 YES, HE DID.
 CONVICTED OF BRUTALLY
 KILLING HER BOYFRIEND.
 THE BLOODY CRIME SEEN.
 IT WAS EVERYWHERE.
 WHY HER LAWYER SAID TAKING
 ON HER CASE RUINED HIS LIFE,
 CAREER AND HEALTH.
 THIS ISN'T THE WAY I WANTED
 TO LIVE LIFE.
 ADDICTED TO LACKS TIFFELS.
 I COULDN'T GET THROUGH A DAY
 BECAUSE I WAS CONSTANTLY GOING
 BACK AND FORTH TO A BATHROOM. T.
 Is your dry skin cream not doing             enough?
   Try Eucerin Advanced Repair              cream.

       When you eat a bowl           of oatmeal,
   you're getting beta-glucan.
      That's a soluble fiber
     that slows the breakdown        of carbohydrates.
     And that provides energy           that lasts.
 TOMORROW.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH OUR
 INVESTIGATION INTO SUPERMARKET
 STEAK.
 BRIAN HAS INVESTIGATED, COOKED
 AND TESTED ALL THE SUPERMARKET
 STEAKS.
 HE CAN TELL US WHICH IS THE
 TASTIEST AND CHEAPEST STEAK TO
 BUY SO YOU DON'T OVERSPEND.
 IT IS WHAT?
 FLANK STEAK.
 DR. OZ: MY SON HAS BEEN BUYING
 THAT EXCLUSIVELY, AND IT TASTES
 SO GOOD.
 IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
 CUTS.
 IT IS NICE AND EVEN.
 IT GOES WELL IN STIR FRIDAY,
 TACOS, IN THE PAN.
 IT HAS A NICE AMOUNT OF FAT,
 BUT IT IS ALSO LEAN.
 YOU CAN SEE THE GRAIN
 STRUCTURE.
 IT HELPS WITH SLICING.
 DR. OZ: WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE
 GET FLANK STEAK?
 BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
 A LOT.
 DR. OZ: YES.
 THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE ALL MAKE
 IS WHAT WITH MEAT?
 PEOPLE DON'T GET THE RIGHT
 TEMP.
 THEY OVER COOK IT AND UNDERCOOK
 IT IT IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE
 PEOPLE TEND TO FOLLOW RECIPES
 AND THEY LOOK AT THE TIMES WHEN
 YOU NEED TO BE GOING BY THE
 VISUAL CUES OR THE ACTUAL
 NUMBERS THE YOU NEED TO INVEST
 IN A DIGITAL VERLANDER TER.
 YOU CAN GET THEM FOR A FEW DAYS
 ONLINE AND THEY MAKE A WORLD OF
 DIFFERENCE.
 THAT IS WHAT CHEFS USE.
 DR. OZ: LOOK AT THIS CHART.
 DON'T GO BY THE OUTSIDE.
 LOOK AT THE TEMP CHART AND YOU
 WILL GET THERE.
 DO YOU EVER LOOK AT IT AND SAY
 THIS IS RARE?
 YES.
 YOU CAN HOLD YOUR FINGERS
 TOGETHER, PINKIE TO THUMB, THAT
 IS WELL DONE.
 THIS IS RARE, MEDIUM RARE.
 DR. OZ: RARE, WELL-DONE.
 RARE, WELL-DONE.
 THAT WITH YOUR TEMP CHART AND
 YOU ARE GOOD.
 AND THEN THE MEAT?
 ONE OF THE MISTAKES PEOPLE
 MAKE IS THEY DON'T DRY THE MEAT
 BEFORE IT HITS THE SKILLET.
 IN ORDER TO GET THE BROWNING
 CARMELIZATION IS TO MAKE SURE
 THE MOISTURE IS GONE.
 YOU WANT TO CUT IT INTO
 INDIVIDUAL STEAKS.
 SPLIT THIS ONE DOWN THE MIDDLE.
 THEN I WILL CUT IT INTO A
 LITTLE STEAK LEAK THIS SO YOU
 CAN HAVE INDIVIDUAL PORTIONS
 FOUR GUESTS.
 ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS HEAT UP A
 LITTLE OIL IN A CAST-IRON
 SKILLET HERE.
 SEASON THE STEAK UP NICELY.
 A LITTLE KOSHER SALT AND BLACK
 PEPPER.
 DR. OZ: WHEN IT STARTS TO
 BUBBLE A LITTLE BIT, YOU THROW
 IT ON.
 YOU WILL SEE THE OIL START
 TO SHIMMER AND BARELY SMOKE.
 THEN IT IS HOT, AND YOU DROP
 THE STEAK IN THERE.
 YOU WANT TO HEAR THAT SIZZLE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: ALL RIGHT.
 ONCE YOU HAVE REGALED YOUR
 GUESTS WITH THIS, THERE IS A
 BIG MISTAKE WE ALL MAKE.
 IT COMES OFF AND LOOKS SO GOOD.
 BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS
 VIDEO, AUDIENCE.
 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY OF
 YOU ARE DOING.
 YOU ARE NOT LETTING YOUR MEAT
 REST.
 IT IS STILL HOT, LOOKS GREAT.
 BIG MISTAKE.
 WHY SHOULD YOU LET YOUR MEAT
 REST?
 WHEN YOU PULL THE MEAT OUT
 OF THE SKILLET OR OFF THE
 GRILL, IT IS STILL COOKING.
 YOU NEED TO GIVE IT TIME TO
 COME DOWN TO TEMP WHERE IT IS
 EVEN ENJOYABLE TO EAT.
 AS THE MEAT COOKS, ALL THE
 JUICES IN THE MEAT ARE RUSH TO
 THE CENTER.
 IF YOU WERE TO IMMEDIATELY
 STARS SLICING THAT, THE JUICES
 WOULD RUSH OUT ON TO YOUR
 BOARD.
 DR. OZ: IT STOPS BURNING ME.
 KEEP TALKING.
 YOU WANT TO GIVE IT TIME FOR
 THE JUICES TO REDISTRIBUTE.
 I USE A WIRE RACK.
 THE REASON IS THE AIR
 CIRCULATES AROUND THE MEAT AS
 IT COOLS.
 YOU ARE NOT LETTING IT SIT IN
 ITS JUICES.
 YOU SEE THE JUICES THAT COME
 OFF IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN.
 IF IT IS SITTING IN ITS JUICES,
 WASHES OFF THE CARMELIZED
 EXTERIOR.
 DR. OZ: MANY OF US DO THIS PART
 WRONG.
 RIGHT.
 THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
 KEY NEXT TO TEMP IT GETTING A
 TENDER CUT OF MEAT.
 YOU WANT TO SLICE AGAINST THE
 GREEN.
 THAT IS WHY I LOVE FLANK.
 YOU CAN SEE THE GRAIN.
 TURN IT 90 DEGREES.
 PUT YOUR KNIFE 90 DEGREES TO
 THAT AND GIVE IT SOME THIN
 SLICES.
 DR. OZ: IF YOU DON'T DO THAT,
 THE MEAT IS CHEWIER?
 IF YOU WERE TO CUT IT WITH
 THE GRAIN, IT WOULD BE TOO
 CHEWY.
 DR. OZ: TRY IT AND YOU WILL
 SEE.
 THANK YOU BRIAN.
 CHECK YOU OUT COOKS COUNTRY
 MAGEE S.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, A LOOK
 INSIDE THE CHICKEN NUGGETS
 RECALL THAT IS FREAKING
 EVERYBODY OUTS.
 DR. OZ:
 DR. OZ: COMING UP WHAT, IS THE
 DEAL WITH ALL THE CHICKEN
 NUGGET RECAL
  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away

 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: TODAY WHAT, IS THE DEAL
 WITH ALL THE CHICKEN NUGGET
 RECALLS LATELY?
 THERE IS WOOD CHIPS I HAVE
 SEEN, PIECES OF RUBBER
 LITERALLY.
 THAT IS WHAT THE REPORTS ARE.
 120,000 POUNDS OF NUGGETS WERE
 RESENTLY RECALLED FROM TWO
 MAJOR BRANDS FOR CONTINUED
 CONTAMINANTS AND POSSIBLE ALER
 GENERALS.
 BEHIND THE FOOD HEADLINES, WE
 COVER WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON.
 OUR CHEF IS HERE TO HELP
 INVESTIGATE.
 WHAT I HAVE READ ABOUT RUBBER,
 I WASN'T QUITE SURE HOW WOULD
 IT GET INTO THE CHICKEN NUGGET?
 WELL, HERE'S THE STORY.
 PEOPLE STARRED FINDING LITTLE
 BITS OF RUBBER THIS THEIR
 CHICKEN NUGGETS, AND THEY
 STARTED CALLING IN.
 THEY DID A LITTLE
 INVESTIGATION, AND WHAT
 HAPPENED WAS A PIECE OF A
 RUBBER SEAL IN SOME OF THE
 MACHINERY THEY USE TO MAKE THE
 NUGGETS, FELL IN THERE, GOT
 MIXED IN, AND IT WENT OUT.
 I HAVE HEARD OF RUB ERI
 NUGGETS, BUT NOT RUBBER IN THE
 NUGGETS.
 70,000 POUNDS OF GLUTEN FREE
 NUGGETS WERE RECALLED BECAUSE
 THEY HAD WOOD CHIPS.
 WHY WOULD THERE BE WOOD CHIPS
 IN THERE?
 THEY LOOKED AT THIS ONE, AND
 THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
 THEY SAID THERE MAY BE WOOD IN
 THERE SO THEY DID THE RECALL.
 DR. OZ: NO ONE HAS REPORTED
 ADVERSE REACTIONS AFTER EATING
 THE NUGGETS.
 THE RECALL WAS BEING MADE OUT
 OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION.
 YOU SAY IT IS OFTEN A CHALLENGE
 TO DETERMINE THINGS?
 IT IS PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF
 THE NATURE OF THE WAY THEY ARE
 MADE.
 THEY CHOP IT UP INTO BITS AND
 PIECES, AND IT IS THIS BIG MIX.
 DR. OZ: LET'S GO TO THAT.
 YOU ALL THINK CHICKEN NUGGETS
 ARE BASICALLY CHICKEN FROM A
 CHICKEN WREST, CHOPPED UP INTO
 PIECES AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS.
 YOU PASTE THEM TOGETHER, IT
 PROBABLY LOOKED LIKE THAT
 ORIGINALLY.
 IS THAT WHAT WE ALL THINK?
 THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD
 THINK.
 I WOULD HOPE.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS NOT QUITE WHAT
 HAPPENS.
 EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS WITH
 NUGGETS?
 YOU HAVE WATER, SOY, WHEAT
 PROTEIN, SALT, AND A MYSTERY
 INGREDIENT LIKE WHY IS THAT
 THERE?
 SUGAR.
 YOUR ARE PROBABLY GOING TO DUNK
 IT INTO BARBECUE SAUCE
 ANYWHERE.
 WHY DO THAT?
 DR. OZ: THERE ARE SOME GUYS
 DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY, SOME
 ARE NOT.
 REWARD THE GUYS DOING THE RIGHT
 JOB.
 I BET MOST ARE TRYING TO DO THE
 RIGHT JOB.
 IF WE OPEN OUR EYES, WE CAN
 SUPPORT THEM.
 IF WE IGNORE THE OTHERS, YOU
 WON'T HAVE THAT STUFF.
 HELP US FIGURE OUT WHICH
 PRODUCTS TO BUY.
 WE SHOWED CHICKEN BREASTS, WE
 SHOULD LOOK FOR THAT, RIGHT?
 RIGHT.
 THE FIRST INGREDIENT SHOULD BE
 CHICKEN.
 THE FIRST INGREDIENT SHOULD SAY
 CHICKEN BREAST, AND THEN THE
 SECOND THING, THE LESS
 INGREDIENTS THE BETTER.
 THE REST SHOULD BE FLOUR AND
 SEASONINGS THAT GO IN THE
 COATING.
 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRONOUNCE
 ALL
 DR. OZ: GOD BLESS YOU.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 YOUR WEAR HELPS YOU STAY ACTIVE.
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR ONLY
 ACTIVITY IS PUTTING THOSE
 STRETCHY PANTS ON.
 DONCIC WE ARE INVESTIGATING THEE
      <i> When you're expecting</i>     <i> a little angel, be soft.</i>

 THAT IS WEDNESDAY.
 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: TODAY WE ARE TALKING
 ABOUT A VERY REAL ADDICTION
 THAT AFFECTS MILLIONS OF
 PEOPLE.
 YOU MAY NOT REALIZE THAT YOU
 ARE ONE OF THEM.
 IF YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH YOUR
 INBOX FLOODED WITH PROMOTIONS
 FROM STORES.
 FILING YOUR CART UP WITH THINGS
 YOU DON'T REALLY NEED.
 A CLICK, THE SWEATER, SHOES
 THAT LOOK TO PRETTY, NEW SKIN
 PRODUCT.
 YOU FEEL THAT EUPHORIA WITH THE
 PURCHASE.
 BUT THEN THE DREADED CREDIT
 CARD BILLS COME, ALONG WITH
 PANIC AND GUILT.
 HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?
 I AM TALKING ABOUT EXTREME
 ONLINE SHOPPING ADDICTION.
 DR. OZ: RETAIL THERAPY HAS GONE HIGH TECH AND VERY INEVASIVE.
 FOR MANY, EVERY SALE TEXT OR
 E-MAIL MEANS TEMPTATION AND
 FUELS ONLINE SHOPPING
 ADDICTION.
 YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO BUY
 SOMETHING BECAUSE THE COUPONS
 THEY SEND YOU.
 THE LINK IS RIGHT THERE.
 CONSTANTLY REMINDING YOU THAT
 YOU WANT ME, YOU WANT TO BUY
 ME.
 YOU NEED TO BUY ME.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF
 BED.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OFF THE
 COUCH OR LEAVE YOUR OIFMENT YOU
 CLICK AND IT IS THERE.
 I AM A REALTOR, I HAVE TO LOOK
 GOOD.
 IT DOES GET EXPENSIVE TO KEEP
 UP TO DATE, TO BE IN FASHION.
 YOU NEED SLACKS, YOU NEED
 SKIRTS, YOU NEED EVERYTHING,
 AND YOU NEED BAG TO GO WITH IT.
 I LOVE SHOES AND
 POCKETBOOKS, ALL TYPES.
 SHOES AND POCKET BOOKS MAKE ME
 HAPPY.
 CAN YOU GRAB THE MIROTIC LK
 PLEASE?
 IF I AM NOT ON TOP OF HOUSE
 TREMENDOUS AS A REALTOR, HOW AM
 I GOING TO EFFECTIVELY SELL
 YOUR HOME?
 YOU NEED NEW MUGS, AND THEN YOU
 NEED NEW SILVERWARE, AND IT
 KIND OF SNOWBALLS, AND YOU NEED
 NEW THINGS TO GO WITH NEW
 THINGS.
 HER HUSBAND DOESN'T AGREE.
 I THINK IT IS A PROBLEM
 BECAUSE SHE -SHE THINKS IT
 ISN'T, BUT SHE DOESN'T.
 SHE WANTS IT.
 SHE MAY NOT KNOW HOW MUCH.
 I HANDLE ALL THE BILLS.
 I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN THEY WENT
 FROM BEING DELIVERED IN THE
 MAIL TO ONLINE BECAUSE THEN MY
 HUSBAND CANO SEE THEM.
 IF MADE MY LIFE A LOT EASIER.
 WE HAVE A SECURITY CAMERA AT
 THE FRONT DOOR, AND WE GET
 NOTIFICATIONS ON OUR PHONES.
 I DISABLED MY HUSBAND'S ON HIS
 PHONE WHEN I KNOW I AM GETTING
 A DELIVERY, AND I FIX IT AFTER
 I GET THE DELIVERY.
 BUT AS A UPS DELIVERYMAN,
 ERIC KNOWS ABOUT THE RISE IN
 ONLINE SHOPPING.
 MOST OF THE TIME I DELIVER
 TO THE SAME HOUSES OVER AND
 OVER AND THINK THEY ARE ADDICT
 THE TO THIS.
 NOW I SEE IT AT MY HOUSE, I
 KNOW THAT IS A PROBLEM.
 DR. OZ: I AM JOINED NOW BY
 JOYCE AND HER HONEST
 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF WHAT IS
 HAPPENING.
 THANK YOU FOR TELLING THE
 TRUTH.
 HOW BAD HAS YOUR ONLINE
 ADDICTION GOTTEN?
 IT HAS GOTTEN PRETTY BAD.
 I WAKE UP THINKING ABOUT IT.
 I THINK ABOUT IT THROUGHOUT THE
 DAY.
 I AM GETTING THE E-MAILS, THE
 TEXT REMINDERS, ON MY SOCIAL
 MEDIA.
 IT IS PRETTY MUCH CONSUMING MY
 DAY.
 DR. OZ: SO YOUR HUSBAND ERIC
 KINDLY JOINS YOU.
 HE IS IN THE AUDIENCE A SAFE
 DISTANCE AWAY.
 HOW BAD DO YOU THINK YOUR
 WIFE'S ADDICTION HAS BECOME AND
 HOW IS IT AFFECTING YOU AND THE
 FAMILY?
 WELL, IT IS BAD.
 IT IS REALLY BAD.
 WE GET TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE
 IN AN ARGUMENT.
 WE SAY WE HAVE TO STOP.
 WHEN WE GET HOME, I START TO
 FEEL WHY ARE WE RECYCLING SO
 MANY BOXES?
 THEN SHE CONTINUES.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, DR.
 OZ.
 I NEED HELP.
 DR. OZ: YOU REALIZE THIS IS NOT
 JUST ABOUT THE SHOPPING.
 WE SEE PICTURES OF THE CLOSET
 FULL OF SHOES, AND EVERYONE
 GASPS.
 BUT THE DEEPER PAIN IS WHEN
 YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS DESTROYED
 OR HURT IN ANY WAY THROUGH THIS
 ADDICTION?
 I FEEL TERRIBLE.
 I FEEL SO GUILTY, AND IT
 BOTHERS ME.
 I FEEL BAD WHEN HE IS UPSET AT
 ME, BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T STOP
 ME.
 I ALMOST NEED TO DO IT.
 WHEN I AM BUYING SOMETHING FOR
 THE FAMILY, WHEN I AM BUYING
 SOMETHING FOR THE KIDS OR FOR
 HIM, I AM HAPPY.
 GREAT, HE NEEDED GLASSES,
 READERS.
 I DON'T BUY HIM ONE PAIR, I BY
 HIM THREE.
 I KNOW HE IS GOING TO BREAK ONE
 PAIR.
 DR. OZ: THOSE SEEMS LIKE
 EXCUSES TO ME.
 YOU HAVE WAYS OF JUSTINNING IT,
 AND SO THE RELATIONSHIP IS
 BEATEN UP.
 ALICIA HAS JOINED US.
 SHE ADMITS TO SPENDING BETWEEN
 $3,000 AND $4,000 A MONTH ON
 ONLINE PURCHASE, MOSTLY ON
 CLOTHES AND SHOES.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: HOW BAD HAS YOUR
 ADDICTION TO SHOPPING GOTTEN?
 IT IS BAD.
 IT IS TO THE .WHERE I WAKE UP
 IN THE MORNING -TO THE POINT
 WHERE I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
 AND I WANT TO GO ONLINE.
 I SLEEP GOING ONLINE.
 I DREAM BEING ON LINE.
 DR. OZ: HOW IS YOUR
 RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FAMILY?
 CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW MY
 HUSBAND IS IN KUWAIT.
 DR. OZ: HE IS IN THE ARMED
 FORCES?
 HE IS IN THE ARMY.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU FOR THAT.
 LET US HELP HIM AND HELP YOU.
 AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE TONS
 AND TONS OF STUFF THAT SINCE HE
 HAS BEEN GONE, TO HELP ME COPE
 WITH HIM BEING GONE.
 WHAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER IS
 SHOPPING.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS YOUR LOWEST
 POINT?
 HOW BAD HAS IT GOTTEN?
 MY LOUEST POINT I RECALL IS
 WHEN HE WAS HOME ONE DAY AND HE
 GAVE ME SOME MONEY TO GO PAY
 THE ELECTRIC BILL.
 BUT THERE WAS A SALE GOING ON,
 SO I WENT AHEAD AND I WENT
 SHOPPING, FIGURING LIKE OK, I
 WILL TAKE CARE OF IT NEXT WEEK,
 NOT KNOWING THAT IT WAS DUE AT
 THAT TIME.
 SO HE WAS WORKING AT HOME, AND
 WE GOT A KNOCK AT THE DOOR, AND
 IT WAS THE ELECTRIC PEOPLE
 COMING TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS.
 DR. OZ: TURN OFF THE
 ELECTRICITY?
 YES, BECAUSE OF THE FACT
 THAT I FORGOT TO PAY IT.
 DR. OZ: YOU DIDN'T FORGET NOT
 TO PAY IT.
 YOU DECIDED NOT TO PAY IT.
 HE WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT?
 YES.
 THAT WAS EMBARRASSING.
 I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO JUST
 DIANE JUST CRY.
 HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID I GAVE
 YOU THAT MONEY TO GO PAY THE
 ELECTRIC BILL.
 I WAS LIKE I KNOW.
 I'M SORRY.
 DR. OZ: LET'S DIVE INTO WHY
 THAT CHOICE IS HAPPENING.
 JOYCE, WHAT DO YOU FEEL THAT
 MOMENT YOU PRESS CLICK AND BUY
 SOMETHING?
 IT IS ALMOST A HIGH.
 IT IS EXHILARATING.
 YES.
 DR. OZ: ALMOST A HIGH.
 IT IS LIKE A DRUG.
 IT FEELS REALLY GOOD.
 DR. OZ: WELL, IT TURNS OUT IT
 IS EXACTLY LIKE A DRUG.
 IT IS LITERALLY AFFECTING YOUR
 BRAIN THE WAY DRUGS DO.
 WHEN YOU TAKE CRACK COCAINE,
 YOU TURN ON THE DOPE MINUTE.
 -DOMPAMINE.
 SUGAR DOES TO.
 WHEN YOU DO THINGS THAT FEEL
 GREAT, IT IS SUPPOSED TO FEEL
 GREAT SO YOU DO MORE OF THEM.
 THERE IS WAYS OF HACKING THE
 SYSTEM.
 IT MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT WHEN
 YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING GREAT
 NECESSARILY.
 FOR THAT REASON, YOU GET THE
 SAME DRUG HIGH, THE SAME
 ADDICTIVE REACTIONS.
 HE HAS A REAL PROBLEM WITH THE
 ENACT THAT YOU ARE NOT HONEST
 ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
 YOUR HUSBAND IS SERVING OUR
 NATION BRAVELY, BUT HE FINDS
 OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING.
 WHAT I AM DOING IS TAKING
 ALL THE STUFF THAT IVAN I AM
 ACTUALLY OPENING UP A LITTLE
 BOTIQUE IN MY HOUSE SO I CAN
 KIND OF GET RID OF A LOT OF
 STUFF.
 DR. OZ: THAT HELPS A LITTLE
 BUILT.
 YEAH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: ARE YOU OPEN TO GETTING
 HOPE TO DEAL WITH THE
 UNDERLYING REASON THAT YOU WANT
 SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T NEED,
 THAT YOU WANT TO COMPROMISE THE
 MOST PRECIOUS COVENANT WE HAVE
 WITH THE PEOPLE WE LOVE FOR AN
 ADDICTION TO SHOPPING?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: COMING UP, WE ARE GOING
 TO OFFER SOME CONCRETE
 SOLUTIONS TO HELP EVERYONE AT
 HOME WITH THEIR ONLINE SHOPPING
 ADDICTION BECAUSE THERE ARE A
 LOT OF US.
 NEXT.
 DID YOU KILL TRAVIS
 ALEXANDER?
 YES, I DO.
 WHYLER LAWYER SAYS TAKING ON
 HER CASE RUINSED HIS LIFE,
 CAREER AND HEALTH.
 PLUS, ADDICTED TO LAXATIVES.
 I WAS CONSTANTLY GOING BACK
 AND FORTH TO A BATHROO
        (VO) At Pro Plan,

         It hasn't always        been easy, has it?

       There have been days    when you doubted yourself.

        And days when you       were ready to quit.

         But you didn't.

  Because you had the courage to venture into something powerful.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK TALKING
 ABOUT ONLINE SHOPPING
 ADDICTION.
 IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
 IN FACT, THERE IS BETWEEN 5%
 AND 8% OF AMERICANS WE THINK
 WHO SUFFER FROM SOME SORT OF
 SHOPPING ADDICTION.
 WE ARE JOINED BY THE AUTHOR OF
 A PODCAST.
 LET'S GO THROUGH THIS.
 KEEP TRACK OF THESE.
 THE FIRST IS ANXIETY AND
 STRESS, DEALING WITH THE
 ISOLATION THAT RESULTS.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 WE HAVE A STRING OF BAD DEAS
 WHERE WE ARE DOWN ON OURSELVES,
 OFTEN WE TURN TO VICES.
 SHOPPING ADDICTION IS ONE OF
 THOSE VICES THAT MILLIONS TURN
 TO.
 SOCIAL MEDIA IS FUN AN
 ENGAGING, BUT ON THE OTHER END
 IT CAN BE A RABBIT HOLE.
 IT LOOKS PERFECT AND FILTERED.
 THEN YOU START TO FEEL BAD
 ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR TURN TO
 YOUR VICE IN SHOPPING.
 24/7 AVAILABILITY, AND IN
 YOUR PHONE IN YOUR HAND.
 YOU LITERALLY SHOP FOR
 SOMETHING, IT IS ON YOUR
 DOORSTEP THE NEXT DAY.
 THEN FINALLY IT IS ALL THE
 TARGETED E-MAILS, ALL THE
 TARGETED YARDS WE EXPERIENCE
 ONLINE.
 OUR WEB BROWSERS ARE STALKING
 US.
 WE KNOW WHAT WE LIKE AND HAVE
 SEARCHED FOR, AND WE GET THOSE
 ADAMS.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
 GOING ON IN YOUR LIVES?
 THE FEEDS FOR ME.
 THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY THERE.
 WHEN I GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU
 CAN CLICK THE LINK, AND IT
 TAKES YOU DIRECTLY INTO THE
 CART.
 AND IF YOU LEAVE IT THERE, IT
 REMINDS YOU TO GO BACK AND LOOK
 FOR IT.
 IF YOU GO TO A STORE'S WEBSITE
 AND YOU DROP IT IN THE CART, IT
 TELLS YOU AGAIN, AND IT SENDS
 YOU A COUPON.
 IT ADDS YOU TO A MAILING LIST
 AND IT SENDS YOU A COUPON IN
 THE MAIL.
 DR. OZ: NOT AN ACCIDENT.
 YOU THINK IT IS CALLED SERVICE.
 IT IS CALLED HUNTING.
 THEY SEE YOU OUT THERE, A BIG
 BULLSEYE, BALLS YOU ARE YELLING
 OUT HERE I AM.
 THE PRODUCER IS GOING TO GIVE
 US CREET SOLUTIONS FOR
 EVERYBODY.
 FOR EVERYBODY OUT THERE
 WATCHING, WE ARE GOING TO HELP
 YOU OUT.
 FIRST IS UNSUBSCRIBE.
 YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY.
 WHEN YOU GET ALL OF THOSE
 TARGETED E-MAILS, ALTHOUGH
 THOSE SHOP SITES, YOUR FIRST
 INSTINCT EXTINCT SHOULD BE TO
 UNPRESCRIBE -JUNE SUBSCRIBE.
 HOW DO YOU DELAY
 GRATIFICATIONS?
 IT IS LIKE A TWO-STEP
 PROCESS.
 YOU CAN LEARN BY GOOGLING IT.
 YOU CAN BLOCK CERTAIN WEBSITES.
 YOU CAN BLOCK THEM ON YOUR
 PHONE OR COMPUTER SO YOU DON'T
 GET THE TEMPTATION.
 IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE ALWAYS ON
 ONE PARTICULAR SITE, BLOCK IT
 TEMPORARILY.
 THEN DELAY GRATIFICATION.
 MY TIP IS DISTANCE YOURSELF FOR
 24 HOURS, GO TAKE A WALK, A
 SHOWER.
 COME BACK THE NEXT DAY.
 WHY?
 WE TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE LEVELS
 SURGING WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO
 BUYING SOMETHING.
 THAT IS NOT WHEN YOU WANT TO
 MAKE A RATIONAL CHOICE.
 THEN YOU REALIZE YOU PROBABLY
 DON'T WANT THE SHOES.
 WHAT IF YOU TRIED THAT
 ALREADY?
 YOU BLOCKED IT, AND THEN YOU
 LEAVE IT AND COME BACK.
 DR. OZ: I AM BLOCKING, YOU ARE
 BLOCKING HERE.
 WHAT I AM HEARING IS THEY ARE
 CHUMMING THE WATER FOR YOU.
 YOU HAVE TO STOP.
 THAT YOU COULD LET THEM PUT
 THAT STUFF AROUND YOU BECAUSE
 YOU START GOBBLING UP WHATEVER
 IS AROUND YOU.
 PART OF IT IS AROUND YOU, AND
 YOU HAVE TO AVOID THE PRIME
 TIME ONLINE SHOPPING.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
 HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR HABITS.
 PRIME SHOPPING HOURS ONLINE IS
 AFTER WORK AND BEFORE WE GO TO
 BED.
 YOU HAVE GIVEN US GREAT
 TACTICS.
 HOW DO YOU GET THE EMOTIONAL
 SUPPORT.
 THIS IS THE CRUX OF IT.
 YOU HAVE TO LOOK WITHIN.
 WHAT IS THE EMOTIONAL VOID THAW
 OF TRYING TO FILL WITH STUFF?
 THIS ISN'T ABOUT EASY ACCESS OR
 TECHNOLOGY ALL THE TIME.
 REALLY AT THE HEART OF IT IS
 THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING.
 I THINK TRULY TO ADDRESS THAT
 IS OF THE UTMOST.
 FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MEANS
 THERAPY.
 FOR OTHERS IT MAY MEAN REACHING
 OUT TO FRIENDS.
 I THINK COMING ON THIS SHOW AND
 BEING OPEN AND HONEST WITH US
 AND YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS IS
 AN AMAZING FIRST STEP, AND I
 WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT.
 IT IS REALLY THE FIRST STEP TO
 RECOVERY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE
 WE DO THINK YOU ARE FILLING A
 VOID WITH SHOPPING, WHAT IS
 THAT STERIOD?
 WHERE DO YOU NEED HELP AND
 EMOTIONAL SUPPORT?
 I BELIEVE MINE RIGHT NOW IS
 MY HUSBAND NOT BEING HERE AND
 ME NOT HAVING ANYONE TO TALK TO
 AT NIGHT TIME, AND THE
 COMMERCIALS ARE ON.
 I ALSO LIKE SHOPPING WHEN I AM
 STRESSED, OR MY ANXIETY.
 BUT RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE IT IS
 BECAUSE OF HIM NOT BEING HERE.
 DR. OZ: AT LEAST YOU HAVE A
 TARGET NOW.
 LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO.
 I WOULD RATHER HE SEND YOU SPAM
 E-MAILS RATHER THAN FROM
 SHOPPERS.
 ERIC IS HERE.
 WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO?
 WHAT IS THE VOID YOU ARE
 FEELING THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE
 TO HELP YOU?
 HE COULD BE HERE, BUT HE
 WORKS.
 HE IS ALWAYS WORKING, AND THERE
 IS ALWAYS OVERTIME.
 HE IS ALSO A SOCCER COACH.
 I WILL NEVER BLAME MY KIDS FOR
 ANYTHING, BUT WE HAVE KIDS.
 WHOSE KIDS DON'T TAKE UP A
 MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME?
 THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING.
 DR. OZ: SO YOU ARE BOTH LONELY,
 WHICH IS PROBABLY A BIG REASON
 WHY SHOP HAS BECOME AN
 ADDICTION.
 THE REAL PERSON YOU HAVE TO
 KEEP COMPANY WITH IS YOU.
 I KNOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO
 SOLVE IT JUST LIKE THAT, BUT AT
 LEAST WE KNOW WHAT TO AIM AT.
 WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GET A
 TRUE SENSE OF NULL FILAMENT
 DOING THE THINGS YOU ARE DOING.
 OBVIOUSLY YOU CHASE AWAY THE
 PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU MOST, WHICH
 MAKES YOU LONELIER.
 WHAT DO YOU DO WITH AN ONLINE
 SHOPPING ADDICTION?
 SOME AT HOME HAVE WOKEN UP TO
 THAT REALITY?
 REACH OUT TO SOMEONE YOU
 TRUST, A FRIEND.
 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT FEELINGS
 OF ISOLATION, FEELING LONELY.
 YOU CAN ONLY CONTROL WHAT YOU
 CAN CONTROL.
 YOU CONTROL YOUR ENVIRONMENT,
 CONTROL YOUR COMMUNITY, REACH
 OUT TO PEOPLE.
 IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND AND YOU
 ARE WATCHING, I HAVE A FRIEND
 WITH AN ONLINE SHOPPING
 ADDICTION, BE THE FRIEND, CALL
 YOUR FRIEND.
 SHOW UP, INITIATE ACTIVITIES
 TOGETHER.
 THEN BREAK THE ICE AND TALK
 ABOUT HOW YOU ARE REALLY
 FEELING.
 YOU CANNOT KEEP IT BOTTLED UP.
 DR. OZ: GOD BLESS YOU BOTH FOR
 BEING HERE.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A
 SHOPPING ADDICTION,
 DR. OZ: GOD BLESS YOU.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 YOUR WEAR HELPS YOU STAY ACTIVE.
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR ONLY
 ACTIVITY IS PUTTING THOSE
 STRETCHY PANTS ON.
 DONCIC WE ARE INVESTIGATING THEE
        I'm a close talker.

      I didn't know what was           happening...
         so I kept it in.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: ITCH, YOU SCRATCH IT,
 AND THEN YOU REPEAT.
 RIGHT?
 WE ALL DO IT.
 WE ITCH, SCRATCH, REPEAT.
 ITCH, SCRATCH, REPEAT.
 WE ARE HARD WIRED.
 CHANCES ARE, IF YOU ARE AN
 ECZEMA SUFFERER, THIS AN
 EMBARRASSING CYCLE THAT YOU AND
 YOUR SKIN ARE ALL TOO FAMILIAR
 WITH.
 I HAVE BROUGHT IN A BOARD
 CERTIFIED DERMATOLOGIST TOE
 TALK ABOUT THIS.
 THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: ITCHING IS A NATURAL
 RESPONSE, BUT SOMETIMES IT GETS
 OUT OF HAND.
 ECZEMA IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE.
 EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS AND WHAT
 CAUSES THIS?
 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT
 TYPES OF ECZEMA, BUT ONE OF THE
 MOST COMMON IS ATOPIC ECZEMA OR
 ATOPIC DERMATITIS.
 IT IS A CHRONIC CONDITION.
 IT AFFECTS 30% OF CHILDREN AND
 15% OF ADULTS.
 UNFORTUNATELY, THE PREVALENCE
 IS ON THE RISE.
 IT RUNS IN FAMILIES AND IT IS
 TRIGGERED BY CERTAIN THINGS,
 SOME ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS,
 IRRITANTS, ALLERGENS AND
 CHANGES IN THE WEATHER.
 IT CAN BE REALLY DISRUPTIVE TO
 NOT ONLY THE PERSON BUT FAMILY
 MEMBERS AS WELL.
 IT IS REALLY A QUALITY OF LIFE
 ISSUE.
 DR. OZ: REMIND EVERYBODY OF THE
 CLASSIC SYMPTOMS.
 THIS TYPE OF ECZEMA IS
 CHARACTERIZED BY RED, INFLAMED,
 DRY AND ITCHY SKIN.
 IT IS INTENSELY ITCHY, SO
 PEOPLE START TO SCRATCH IT,
 WHICH CAN MAKE IT WORSE.
 OVER TIME THE SKIN CAN THICKEN
 AS WELL.
 ANOTHER KEY FACTOR IS IT IS
 CHRONIC AND RELAPSING.
 YOU HAVE FLAIR UPS AND
 RECURRENCES, AND PERIODS OF
 RASH-FREE SKIN.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS YOUR
 OPPORTUNITY.
 LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT EXPERTS
 BELIEVE IS HAPPENING IN THE
 ECZEMA CYCLE.
 WE HAVE BUILT A LITTLE MODEL.
 LET'S SAY THIS IS THE IS YOUR
 -IS THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN.
 HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE SKIN THAT
 LOOKS LIKE.
 THIS NORMAL, FINE, NO PROBLEMS.
 WITH ATOPIC ECZEMA, SOMETHING
 IRRITATES YOUR SKIN.
 YOU START TO GET A LITTLE
 ITCHING.
 AS THE IRRITANT BECOMES MORE
 PREVALENT, YOU START TO ITCH
 HARDER AND HARDER AND YOU
 SCRATCH IT.
 THEN YOU START TO HAVE THE
 BEGINNINGS OF AN ECZEMA
 FLAIR-UP.
 IT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE
 ONCE IT IS THERE IT IS HARDER
 TO STOP IT.
 YOU GET WRINKLING OF THE SKIN.
 IT LOOKS IRRITATED AND WILL DRY
 IT OUT.
 THE MORE YOU ITCH IT, THE MORE
 YOU GET PROBLEMS.
 YOU DON'T JUST GET THE SCALING,
 BUT MORE SIGNIFICANCE BREAKS IN
 THE SKIN, WHICH COULD
 COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE THAT MUCH
 MORE.
 WHAT IS THE GOAL OF TREATING
 ECZEMA WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO
 ITCH AWAY EVERYTHING?
 YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TO THE
 POINT WHERE YOU ARE BREAKING
 DOWN THE SKIN.
 WHEN YOU HAVE A SEVERE FLAIR UP
 LIKE THIS, YOU MAY NEED TO GO
 TO A DERMATOLOGIST TO GET A
 STEROID CREAM TO CALM THIS
 DOWN.
 SINCE THIS IS A CHRONIC
 RELAPSING CONDITION, THE
 LONG-TERM GROLE IS TO PROLONG
 THE FLAIR-FREE PERIODS AND
 REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE.
 THE NUMBER ONE THINGS YOU CAN
 DO FOR YOUR SKIN IS
 MOISTURIZING YOUR SKIN EVERY
 DAY.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND
 FOR LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF
 ECZEMA?
 I LIKE TO RECOMMENDED USERIN
 KAREEM.
 IT IS AN OVER THE COUNTER
 PRODUCT THAT CAN BE USED EVERY
 DAY TO REDUCE THE IRRITATION
 AND DRYNESS OF THE SKIN.
 IT ALMOST FORMS LIKE A
 PROTECTIVE SEAL OVER THE SKIN
 TO SOOTHE IRRITATION AND
 REDNESS, AND IT IS
 STEROID-FREE, WHICH MEANS YOU
 CAN USE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY,
 WHICH IS KEY.
 USERIN CONDUCTED A STUDY IN
 WHICH THEY LOOK THE OUT FOUR
 OUT OF FIVE CHILDREN USING THE
 CREAM EVERY DAY, AND IT SHOWED
 THEY WERE FLAIR-FRY FOR SIX
 MONTHS WITH EVERY DAY USE.
 IF YOU ARE THE PARNTSDE OF A
 CHILD WITH THAT TYPE OF ECZEMA,
 SIX MONTHS OF NO FLARES IS A
 VERY, VERY BIG DEAL.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THAT IS GOOD.
 AND FOR THE ADULTS THAT WERE
 USING IT, THEY SHOWED
 IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR MILD TO
 MODERATE SYMPTOMS OF IN TWO
 WEEKS OF USING.
 DR. OZ: WE GAVE USERIN TO TWO
 OF MY VIEWERS.
 TERESA HAS BEEN USING IT FOR A
 FEW WEEKS, AND PATRICIA FEW
 MONTHS.
 DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR SKIN WAS
 LIKE BEFORE YOU STARTED USING
 THIS APPROACH.
 FIRST OF ALL, ECZEMA CAME
 INTO MY LIFE OUT OF NOWHERE
 WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY
 SECOND BABY.
 HE ACTUALLY HAS A LITTLE BIT OF
 ECZEMA TOO, AND I STARTED USING
 IT ON HIM.
 FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FROM MY
 DAIRY.
 I CUT OUT DAIRY AND A LOT OF
 THINGS, DRIVING MYSELF CREZZ.
 THEN I STARRED USING ALL THE
 NATURAL CREAMS.
 IT LITERALLY TOOK OVER MY LIFE,
 CHANGING DETERGENT ENTS AND
 SHEETS AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN
 THINK OF.
 SOME OF IT WENT AWAY, BUT THE
 KNUCKLES, THE PARTS THAT GET
 CONSTANT TOUCH, AS I AM A BUSY
 MOM OF TWO.
 THEY WILL ACTUALLY KEPT THE
 SAME AND GETTING WORSE,
 IRRITATED AND CRACKING.
 IT WAS JUST UNCOMFORTABLE.
 HAVING THAT ON YOUR HANDS, AND
 IT NEVER WAS GETTING A CHANCE
 TO RECOVER.
 ANYTHING I WAS USING WAS GOING
 TO TAKE LONGER TO RECOVER.
 DR. OZ: OH, MY GOODNESS.
 LOOK AT THIS.
 YES.
 A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
 DR. OZ: SHE IS JUST TRYING TO
 GET US TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE
 RING.
 IT IS REALLY ABOUT THE RING.
 THAT IS REMARKABLE.
 THIS IS ANOTHER THING.
 HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THE RING
 WHEN YOU HAVE THE ECZEMA HERE?
 I HAVE TO GET RID OF IT.
 DR. OZ: ARE YOU SURPRISED AT
 WHAT TERESA IS SAYING?
 NO.
 AS A DERMATOLOGIST, WE HEAR A
 LOT ABOUT ECZEMA AND ABOUT HOW
 IT AFFECTS PEOPLE'S LIVES.
 THERE ARE REAL PHYSICAL
 PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
 THAT COME ACROSS, THAT ARE
 REALLY IMPORTANT, WITH ATOPIC
 DERMATITIS.
 PEOPLE FEEL ITCHY IN THEIR
 CLOTHING.
 THEY ARE SOMETIMES EMBARRASSED
 TO SHOW THEIR SKIN, AND IT CAN
 REALLY AFFECT YOUR SLEEP
 PATTERN.
 IF THAT IS HAPPENING IN YOUR
 FAMILY, IT IS EXTREMELY
 DISRUPTY.
 SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING IT
 ON MY SON, HE HAS BEEN HAVING
 BETTER SLEEP.
 DR. OZ: PATRICIA, YOU HAVE BEEN
 USING IT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS?
 WE HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A
 VERY LONG TIME.
 MY DAUGHTER ACTUALLY STARTED
 WITH ECZEMA WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT

 SHE IS 8 NOW.
 WE HAVE BEEN USING USERIN FOR A
 LONG TIME, BUT MUCH MORE
 CONSISTENTLY.
 EVERY DAY WE USE IT.
 WE HAVE HAD ZERO SFLARE UPS.
 I AM VERY EXCITED THAT I DON'T
 HAVE ANY SFLARE UPS.
 DR. OZ, PATRICIA KNOWS, WHEN
 YOU HAVE A YOUNG CHILD WITH
 ECZEMA, IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL.
 TO BE USING IT EVERY DAY TO
 PREVENT THE FLAIR UPS.
 IF YOU CAN PREVENT THE FLAIR
 UPS FOR MONTHS ON END AND THE
 KIDS ARE SLEEPING, IT IS A VERY
 LEPISTOFUL THING.
 DR. OZ: HOW DID YOUR CITIZEN --
 HOW DOES YOUR SKIN FILE
 DIFFERENTLY?
 I HAVE NO CRACKS ON MY ENDS,
 ON MY LEGS WHERE I USUALLY GET
 IT ARE FREE OF IT IT IS
 AMAZING.
 DR. OZ: THE
 [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]
 IS ARE YOUR FRIENDS JEALOUS OF
 YOU AND YOUR HAPPINESS?
 TOTALLY.
 DR. OZ: DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU
 FEEL GOOD?
 TOTALLY.
 DR. OZ: USERIN IS OUR PARTNER.
 THE FIRST 5,000 PEOPLE DOING TO
 DOCTOROZ.COM WILL RECEIVE A
 COUPON FOR A FREE TEA-PARTY OF
 THE ECZEMA CREAM.
 I AM NOT GOING TO STOP THERE.
 MY ENTIRE STUDIO AUDIENCE IS
