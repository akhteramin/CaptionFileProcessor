 THROWING ET OVER TO ALEX WHIT.
 IF THEY CAN UNDERSTAND.
 THEY CAN'T HAND TELL BETWEEN
 SHOW.
 SEND US THE SHOW.
 IT WILL BE A SHOW ONE DAY.
 THANK YOU, SEE YOU TOMORROW.
 A VERY GOOD DAY FROM ALL OF YOU
 IN NEW YORK.
 WELCOME TO WEEKENDS WITH ALEX
 WITT.
 MICHAEL COHEN, WHAT HE BROUGHT
 THIS WEEK?
 A MEMBER OF THE INTEL HOUSE WILL
 TALK TO ME TO TELL ME WHY THE
 NEW DOCUMENTS MATTER SO MUCH.
 WHAT DOES THE DEPARTURE OF
 THE SIXTH DIRECTO MEAN GOING
 FORWARD?
 AND THE PRESIDENT PAYING
 RESPECTS TO AN ALABAMA HOME THAT
 WAS HIT SO HARD.
 WHY WAS HE SEENING BIBLES WHEN
 THERE?
 HAPPENING NOW, THREE MAJOR
 STORIES.
 GROWING FALLOUT OVER THE
 SENTENCING OF FORMER CAMPAIGN
 PAUL MANAFORT.
 DEMOCRATS FACING A GROWING
 BACKLASH OVER CONGRESSWOMAN
 ILHAN OMAR AND 2020 HOPEFULS ARE
 MAKING THEIR CASE ACROSS THE
 COUNTRY.
 AFTER TOURING THE DAMAGE IN
 ALABAMA, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED
 BIBLES.
 HIS TEAM SED SAYS PEOPLE IN A
 BAPTIST CHURCH ASKED HIM FOR HIS
 AUTOGRAPH.
 BEFORE LEAVING, THE PRESIDENT
 SIGNED SIDED WITH MANAFORT.
 MANY BELIEVE IT WAS A LENIENT
 SENTENCE FOR MULTI-MILLION
 DOLLAR CRIMES.
 I FEEL BADLY FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 THE JUDGE SAID THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
 I DON'T EVEN DISCUSS IT.
 THE ONLY ONE DISCUSSING IT IS
 YOU.
 I HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT.
 WELL, TO BE TOTALLY CLEAR.
 JUDGE TS ELLIOT DID NOT S
 THERE WAS NO COLLUSION, BUT
 MANAFORT WAS NOT BEING SENTENCED
 FOR CRIMES RELATED TO COLLUSION.
 THERE IS DISTINCTION THERE.
 ALSO DEVELOPING THIS HOUR,
 ALMOST A WEEK OF HER
 ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS, DEMOCRAT
 OMAR FIND HERSELF AT THE OPEN OF
 DISCUSSION AFTER SAYING THIS
 ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
 WE CAN'T ONLY BE UPSET WITH
 TRUMP.
 HIS POLICIES ARE BAD BUT MANY OF
 THE PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE HIM
 ALSO HAD REALLY BAD POLICIES.
 THEY JUST WERE MORE POLISHED
 THAN HE WAS.
 I WOULD TALK ABOUT THE FAMILY
 SEPARATION OR CAGEING OF KIDS
 AND PEOPLE WOULD POINT OUT THAT
 THIS WAS TRUMP.
 I MEAN, THIS WAS OBAMA.
 I WOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE
 DRONING OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE
 WORLD AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT
 WAS A OBAMA.
 WELL, EARLIER, I SPOKE WELL
 NOR HOLMES NORTON, THE
 DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN
 REPRESENTING DVENLTH LISTEN TO
 HER ACTION OF OMAR'S CRITICISM
 OF PRESIDENT OBAMA.
 I'M ALMOST RELIEVED.
 BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS SHE
 IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY CRITIC.
 I TELL YOU, I THINK THE
 PRODUCTION I PRODUCT OF SOCIAL
 MEDIA, WHEN PEOPLE HEAR HER NO
 THEY ARE PROBABLY WRITING HER
 OFF.
 NO EXPERIENCE, HOW ARE YOU TO
 UNDERSTAND HOW ARE YOU TO BEHAVE
 AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.
 IN TERMS OF HER SPEAKING HER
 MIND.
 THAT'S WHAT FREE SPEECH IS ALL
 ABOUT.
 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES BACK
 OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, IN
 FACT, DEMOCRAT BERNIE SANDERS IS
 SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN IOWA.
 WE WILL BRING YOU HIS FRIENDS
 AND LATER THIS HOUR, WE WILL
 BRING YOU THE STRATEGIST.
 THE QUESTION IS WHY HE LEFT AND
 WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT SANDER,'
 NEW RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
 MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
 RAILING AGAINST HIS FORMER
 ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN CALLING
 HIM A LIAR FOR CLAIMING UNDER
 OATH HE NEVER ASKED FOR A
 PARDON.
 KELLY O'DONNELL IS JOINING US
 FROM WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA,
 RIGHT HERE WHERE THE PRESIDENT
 IS SPENDING HIS WEEKEND.
 WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THIS FRONT?
 Reporter: WELL, ANNA, ON A
 WINDY SATURDAY HERE IN WEST PALM
 BEACH, LET ME TELL YOU THE
 PRESIDENT HAS BEEN HAMMERING
 AWAY AT MICHAEL CON.
 TODAY HE'S AT HIS GOLF COURSE,
 WHERE PRESUMABLY HE IS GETTING
 SOME OF THAT ENERGY OUT DRIVING
 ON THE LINKS, B BEFORE HE LEFT
 THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WAS VERY
 SHARP IN HIS CRITICISM OF COHEN
 AND FOR AS LONG AS MICHAEL COHEN
 IS HEADING TO PRISON AND
 AVAILABLE TO CONGRESS AND
 OTHERS, THE PRESIDENT MAY SEE
 HIM AS AN OPPORTUNITY TARGET TO
 GO AFTER HIM, TRYING TO EXPLOIT
 A PERCEIVED DISCREPANCY IN
 COHEN'S OWN COMMENTS ABOUT A
 REQUEST FOR A PARDON.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IMPRESSED BY
 THIS FROM REPORTERS AS HE WAS
 HEADEDAWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
 ON FRIDAY.
 HERE'S HOW HE LAID OUT ABOUT
 HEN AND THE DISPARITY ON
 COHEN'S POSITION ON WHETHER OR
 NOT HE EVER WANTED A PARDON.
 I KNOW THAT IN WATCHING AND
 SEEING YOU FOLKS AT NIGHT THAT
 MICHAEL COHEN LIED ABOUT THE
 PARDON.
 IT WAS A STONE COLD LIE.
 HE LIED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.
 WHEN HE LIED ABOUT THE PARDON.
 THAT WAS A LIE.
 HE KNEW ABOUT PARDONS.
 HIS LAWYER, SAID THEY WENT TO MY
 LAWYER AND ASKED FOR PARDONS.
 I CAN GO A STEP ABOVE THAT.
 I WON'T GO INTO IT NOW.
 Reporter: WELL, WHEN THE
 PRESIDENT WAS ON THE PLANE, HE
 TALKED ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN SAY
 HE HAD PERSONALLY ASKED THE
 PRESIDENT FOR A PARDON WHEN THEY
 WERE STILL ON SPEAKING TERMS.
 THAT IS DIFFERENT WHAT HIS
 LAWYERS SAY.
 THEY SAY THEY HAD IM INQUIRED
 ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A
 PARDON WHEN THEY WERE OPERATING
 UNDER WHAT IS KNOWN AS A JOINT
 DEFENSE AGREEMENT WHEN THERE ARE
 SORT OF ALLIES FACING
 PROSECUTIONS AND DOCUMENT AND
 INFORMATION.
 THEY WERE WORKING TOGETHER AT
 THAT TIME.
 UNTIL MICHAEL COHEN WAS INDICTED
 AND LATER COOPERATED AND THAT
 AGREEMENT CLEANED UP.
 COHEN FIRED BACK WITH HIS OWN
 TWEET CALLING THAT ALL LIES,
 ENCOURAGING THE PRESIDENT TO USE
 WHAT WAS THE INTERNATIONAL
 WOMEN'S DAY TO MAKE HIS OWN
 APOLOGY, SAID COHEN, TWO WOMEN
 HE HAD SOME RELATIONSHIP WITH IN
 TERMS OF A CANDIDATE, TWO WOMEN
 WHO RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN THE
 LARGE SCHEME OF THINGS TO TRY TO
 CONCEAL THOSE PERSONAL
 RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAD WITH THE
 PRT THAT HE DENIES, SO
 MICHAEL COHEN AND THE PRESIDENT
 ENTANGLED AGAIN ON TWITTER AND
 IN THEIR COMMENTS PUBLICLY.
 OH, YEAH, IT IS WINDY DOWN
 THERE.
 WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT HOUR.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 JOINING ME A DEMOCRAT FROM THE
 HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
 I'M GOING TO GET TO WHAT
 HAPPENED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN
 FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE
 REGARDING MICHAEL COHEN LATER.
 I DO WANT TO START WITH THE
 COMMENTS, NEW ONES BY YOUR
 CONGRESSMAN ILHAN OMAR.
 SHE COMPLAINS ABOUT TRUMP,
 SAYING WE CAN'T BE ONLY UPSET
 ABOUT TRUMP.
 HIS POLICIES ARE BAD.
 BUT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME
 BEFORE HIM ALSO HAD PROBLEMS.
 DOES IT HELP, SIR, FOR
 DEMOCRATS, THE DEMOCRATS TO
 REVISIT THE OBAMA LEGACY FOR

 SO LOOK, ALEX, I DON'T KNOW
 ANY DEMOCRAT WHO WOULDN'T SAY ON
 OCCASION THEY DISAGREED WITH
 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POLICIES.
 I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE DEMOCRAT
 THAT WOULDN'T SWAP OUT PRESIDENT
 OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A
 NEW YORK SECOND.
 THE FACT IS AN OVERWHELMING
 NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS STRONGLY
 SUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA IN MOST
 OF HIS POLICIES, OH LORD, WOULD
 I LOVE TO HAVE HIM BACK AGAIN.
 I THINK A FEW PEOPLE FEEL
 THAT WAY.
 WITH REGARD TO THE
 CONGRESSWOMAN, IS IT RUSHING THE
 STATE TO SPEAK LIKE THAT?
 WELL, I THINK SHE IS IN A
 DIFFERENT FISH BOWL THAN SHE HAS
 SAID BEFORE.
 ANY UTTERANCE AT ANY TIME WILL
 BE AMPLIFIED.
 IF SHE DOESN'T DO IT, HERSELF.
 IT WILL BE RESPONDED TO IN A WAY
 THAT SHE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE.
 LET'S HOPE THERE ARE GROWTH AND
 LEARNING PAINS GOING ON HERE.
 SO YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES
 PASSED A COMPREHENSIVE AND
 CORRUPTIBLE ANTI-LEGISLATION.
 IT WAS BRAIS PLACED ON
 CONDEMNING ALL FORMS OF HATE AS
 THEY ARE LINGERING OVER THE
 ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS.
 WHY DID HER COMMENTS GET
 ATTENTION ON BOT SIDES OF THE
 AISLE?
 DO YOU THINK IT REFLECTS A
 GENERATIONAL DIVIDE OR
 REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MAKE
 IT LOOK THAT WAY?
 SO I THOUGHT THE THING ABOUT
 THE ANTI-HATE PATH.
 FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE
 23 REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR
 HATE OR AGAINST OPPOSITION TO
 HATE.
 I SIMPLY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
 THAT.
 ONE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY
 BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE AN
 ANTI-WHITE DISCRIMINATION CLAUSE
 IN IT HE COULDN'T SUPPORT IT.
 ONE THING IN SPITE OF ALL THE
 MEDIA ATTENTION GIVEN TO THAT
 PARTICULAR RESOLUTION, WHICH
 PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY, WE ALSO
 TOOK UP THE SWEEPING ETHICS
 REFORM MEASURE IN A GENERATION.
 SO WE DID NOT ALLOW ALL THAT
 ATTENTION ON THURSDAY TO
 DISTRACT US AS WE WERE DRAINING
 THE SWAMP AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE
 CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE
 ELECTORAL SYSTEM.
 YEAH.
 SUPER IMPORTANT.
 NOW WE'LL GET NO WHAT HAPPENED
 WITH LAWYER MICHAEL COHEN
 TESTIFYING AGAIN BEHIND CLOSED
 DOORGS TO YOUR COMMITTEE.
 WE SAW HIM WHEEL IN THESE
 DOCUMENTS.
 SOURCES SAY HE SUPPORTS OPEN
 TESTIMONY WEDNESDAY OF LAST
 WEEK.
 SO WHAT YOU CAN TELL US IN THOSE
 DOCUMENTS, DID YOU FIND EVIDENCE
 THAT SUPPORTS ANY OF THE ONGOING
 INVESTIGATIONS, THAT WOULD
 INCLUDE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I THINK I WOULD ASSUME THE
 PHRASE, YOU ARE ASSUMINGACTS
 THAT CONTAIN DOCUMENTS.
 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO ANSWER
 IT, ARE YOU?
 NO WE HAVE DONE IT TOO MANY
 TIMES.
 I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I
 GENUINELY BELIEVE I HAVE LEARNED
 AS MUCH IF NOT MORE IN THE TWO
 DAYS THE OF INTERVIEWING MICHAEL
 COHEN THIS WEEK AND LAST WEEK
 THAN I DID IN TWO YEARS UNDER
 THE INVESTIGATION UNDER THE
 REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.
 IT WAS A SUBSTANTIVE EXCHANGE.
 HE WAS FULLY COOPERATIVE.
 I THINK IT MATERIALLY
 CONTRIBUTED TO OUR INVESTIGATORY
 EFFORTS.
 WE WILL, OF COURSE, AS IN ALL
 GOODS INVESTIGATIONS INSIST ON
 HAVING CORROBORATING EVERYDAY.
 WHEN YOU SAY YOU LEARNED SO
 MUCH IN THESE TWO EPISODES WITH
 HIM, THAT WAS ALL THE BEHIND
 CLOSED DOORS.
 YOU ARE NOT INCLUDING WHAT WE
 HAVE ALL HEARD ON WEDNESDAY OF
 LAST WEEK?
 NO I THINK THERE IS A
 DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND A DIFFER
 TONE.
 THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WHICH
 DID A EXCELLENT JOB HAS A
 DIFFERENT LANE.
 AS YOU KNOW, OUR EFFORTS FOCUS
 ON COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ALSO
 NOTABLY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO
 THE PROFESSION YOU WERE IN AND I
 WAS IN FOR TEN YEARS.
 THERE IS A DIFFERENT TENOR THAT
 OCCURS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
 CAMERAS IN THE ROOM.
 IT'S MORE SERIOUS, I THINK.
 YOU KNOW IF I DIDN'T LIKE YOU
 SO MUCH.
 LET'S LISTEN WHAT COHEN TOLD THE
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY
 WITH REGARD TO THE PRESIDENTIAL
 PARDON.
 HERE'S THAT.
 I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR, NOR
 WOULD I ACCEPT A PARDON FROM
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 SO WHEN HE TESTIFIED BEFORE
 YOUR COMMITTEE THE I GET YOU TO
 ANSWER WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUE
 OF A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON CAME
 UP?
 JUST THE ISSUE?
 SO, ALEX, I THINK COMMON SENSE
 WOULD SUGGEST ANYBODY TO A
 LOGICAL CONCLUSION ON THAT
 QUESTION.
 LET ME GO BACK TO THE ISSUE OF
 THE SENSITIVITY ABOUT THE
 ABSENCE OF CAMERAS AND TO REMIND
 YOU THAT THE TRANSVICTIMS OF
 THESE TWO INTERVIEW SESSIONS
 WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NOT TOO
 DISTANT FUTURE.
 IT HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED THAT
 DATE.
 YOU CORNER HAVE THAT LONG TO
 WAIT BEFORE YOU CAN SEE EVERY
 WORD ASKED AND EVERY WORD
 ANSWERED.
 OKAY.
 WHAT ABOUT REPORTING THAT
 MICHAEL COHEN'S LAWYERS FIRST
 FLOATED THE IDEA OF A PARDON
 WITH THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM.
 CAN I ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE THE
 EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR
 NOTE LIE TO CONGRESS A SECOND
 TIME?
 YOU CAN ASK.
 OH, PLEASE.
 SO HOW ABOUT THIS, THE WHOLE
 EPISODE ALTOGETHER HAS THIS
 UNDERMINED HIS CREDIBILITY FOR
 YOU OR DO YOU FIND HIS TESTIMONY
 CREDIBLE?
 SO HE WAS INCREDIBLY
 COOPERATIVE.
 AS WE ALL WELL KNOW, AS HAS BEEN
 REPRESENTED IN OPEN SOURCES, HE
 BROUGHT RECEIPTS.
 HE DID BRING DOCUMENTS.
 I'M NOT GETTING INTO EXACTLY
 WHAT THEY WERE.
 IT IS A QUESTION NOW OF PIECING
 TOKE THE WHOLE CLOTH.
 IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE OR PRUDENCE
 OF STANDARD PRACTICES TO DRA ANY
 HARD AND FAST PIECE OF TESTIMONY
 OR ONE DOCUMENT.
 ALL OF THESE HAVE TO BE PIECED
 TOGETHER.
 IT WILL INCLUDING GATHERING
 INFORMATION FROM PEOPLE BEYOND
 MICHAEL CON.
 AS OF COURSE, YOU KNOW THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS
 ANNOUNCED WE WILL HAVE FELIX
 SADER IN FOR AN OPEN SESSION I
 BELIEVE LATER ON THIS MONTH.
 THAT'S A PIECE AND PARCEL OF
 THIS AS WELL.
 IT IS, INDEED, AS TALKING
 WITH YOU AND GETTING WHAT WE
 CAN.
 I DO APPRECIATE THE CANDOR YOU
 ARE ABLE TO GIVE US.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 DIVIDE AND CONQUER, HOW
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS EMPLOYED
 THAT STRATEGY IN HIS BATTLE FOR

 RE-ELECTION.

 I THOUGHT YESTERDAY'S VOTE
 BY THE HOUSE WAS DISGRACEFUL
 BECAUSE IT'S BECOME THE
 DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME AN
 ANTI-ISRAEL PARTY.
 THEY'VE BECOME AN ANTI-JEWISH
 PARTY.
 HMM, THE PRESIDENT
 CRITICIZING DEMOCRATS AFTER THEY
 OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED A HOUSE
 RESOLUTION CONDEMNING NOT JUST
 ANTISEMITISM AND RACE ACROSS THE
 BOARD.
 JOINING ME NOW A NATIONAL
 POLITICAL REPORTER FOR "THE
 WASHINGTON POST" AND BRIAN
 BENNETT, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT
 FOR "TIME" MAGAZINE.
 NICE TO SEE YOU, BRYANT I'LL
 START WITH YOU FIRST.
 DO YOU UNG THE DEMOCRATS OPENED
 THEMSELVES UP TO CRITICISM BY
 ALLOWING THIS RESOLUTION TO
 PERCOLATING AS LONG AS IT DID
 BEFORE PASSING IT?
 THIS IS NOT WHAT THE
 DEMOCRATS WANT TO BE TALKING
 ABOUT.
 IT PLAYS INTO TRUMPS PLAN ABOUT
 WHO IS ALIVE WITH ISRAEL AND
 NOT.
 REP OMAR WITH HER COMMENTS HAVE
 OPENED THIS UP FOR THE
 DEMOCRATS.
 THEY FELT THEY HAD TO DO
 SOMETHING.
 IT KEPT IT UP IN THE DEBATE FOR
 SO LONG.
 WHAT THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS
 WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO
 COUNTERCORRUPTION.
 THE MASSIVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO
 TRUMP'S ALLEGED ACTIVITY THEY'VE
 LAUNCHED AND THEY WANT TO TALK
 ABOUT THE VOTING RIGHTS BILL
 THEY'VE PASSED.
 THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TALKING
 ABOUT THIS DIVISIVE ISSUE.
 I WILL GET TO REPRESENTATIVE
 OMAR WITH YOU IN A MOMENT.
 FELICIA, YOU SPECIFICALLY
 REPORTEDTHON AND HOW IT CREATED
 VISION IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY.
 WHY DID IT DIVIDE DEMOCRATS?
 IT'S INTERESTING.
 LEADING UP TO THE ACTUAL VOTE ON
 THURSDAY.
 THIS DID TEAR DEMOCRATS APART.
 YOU HAVE MEMBERS OF THE OLD
 GUARD CALLING FOR THIS YOU HAD
 SOME MEMBERS SAYING THIS SHOULD
 BE DIRECTED TOWARDS
 ANTI-SEMITISM AND CALLING FOR
 THIS TO BE A NARROW RESOLUTION.
 ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE
 MEMBERS OF THIS NEWLY EMBOLDENED
 FRESHMAN CLASS SAYING I NOT
 ABOUT THIS ONE SPECIFIC HATE.
 WE WANT TO BROADEN IT OUT
 AGAINST HATE AND ALL DIFFERENT
 KIND OF GROUPS.
 SO YOU SAW ON THURSDAY THE
 MEASURE WAS ABOUT TO HIT THE
 FLOOR AND GOT PULLED OFF AND
 FINALLY DID COME DOWN FOR A
 VOTE.
 WHAT I THOUGHT WHAT WAS
 INTERESTING IN THE FINAL TALLY,
 THE FOCUS HAD BEEN ABOUT THE
 DEBATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 ON THIS.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, EVERY
 DEMOCRAT VOTED IN FAVOR.
 YOU HAD 23 HOUSE REPUBLICANS
 VOTING AGAINST IT.
 NOW THEY ALL GAVE VARIOUS
 REASONS, SOME HOUSE REPUBLICANS
 SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS WATERED
 DOWN.
 SON SOME FAVORED A NARROW
 ANTI-SEMITISM AND ANOTHER MO
 BROOKS FROM ALABAMA SAYING THAT
 HE THOUGHT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
 BROADER AND INCLUDING
 DISCRIMINATION OF OTHER GROUPS
 OF CHRISTIANS OR CAUCASIANS.
 YOU HAD SEVERAL MEMBERS ON THE
 FLOOR AS WELL SUCH AS DOUG
 COLLINS FROM GEORGIA, BRINGING
 UP THAT VERY POINT.
 SO IT'S INTERESTING THIS DEBATE
 HAS MANY DO WENT IN SOME
 DIRECTION.
 PERHAPS NOT WHAT WAS INTENDED
 IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 OKAY.
 SO REPRESENTATIVE OMAR, YOU
 KNOW, ONE OF THESE NEWLY
 EMBOLDENED ONES, ONE FELICIA
 IDENTIFIED THEM.
 FEATURED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH
 POLITICO MAGAZINE.
 HER COMMENTS ABOUT PRESIDENT
 OBAMA ARE GETTING SOME TRACTION.
 LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO SOME OF
 WHAT SHE SAID.
 WE CAN'T BE ONLY UPSET WITH
 TRUMP.
 HIS PALESS ARE BAD, BUT MANY OF
 THE PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE HIM
 ALSO HAD REALLY BAD POLICIES.
 THEY WERE JUST MORE POLISHED
 THAN HE WAS.
 I WOULD TALK ABOUT THE FAMILY
 SEPARATION OR CAGEING OF KIDS
 AND PEOPLE WOULD POINT OUT THAT
 THCHS TRUMP, I MEAN, THIS WAS
 OBAMA.
 I WOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE
 DRONING OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE
 WORLD AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT
 WAS OBAMA.
 HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PLAYING
 OUT, BRIAN?
 SMR ONCE AGAIN, THIS PLAYS INTO
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HANDS, HE HAS
 BEEN CRITICAL OF OBAMA'S POLICY
 ON THE RIGHT.
 NOW YOU HAVE REPRESENTATIVE
 OMAREK CO-ING VOICES OF THE LEFT
 DURING OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY, WHO
 FELT HE WAS GOVERNING WITH HALF
 MEASURES AND NOT GOING FAR
 ENOUGH OF BIG PICTURE POLICIES.
 IT'S TRUE, I COVERED THE OBAMA
 PRESIDENCY.
 IT WASN'T UNTIL THE SECOND TERM
 THAT HE DESIGNED THE DACA
 PROGRAM AND RULED THAT OUT AFTER
 MASSIVE PRESSURE FROM THE LEFT.
 SO WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO
 HEAR THIS BUBBLING BACK UP
 COMING FROM REPRESENTATIVE OMAR
 AND OTHERS WHO HAVE COME IN FROM
 INTO CONGRESS TRYING TO BRING
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THEIR
 VIEW TO BIGGER AND BOLDER IDEAS.
 SHE IS TALKING ABOUT LEGITIMATE
 DISAPPOINTMENT THAT SHE AND
 OTHERS ON THE LEFT.
 I WANT TO BEGIN WITH PAUL
 MANAFORT AND BEGIN WITH YOU.
 YOU WROTE ABOUT THIS.
 IF HE WOULD HAVE NEVER JOINED
 TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, PAUL MANAFORT
 WOULD BE LIKELY A FREE MAN
 TODAY?
 DO YOU THINK THAT WILL FACTOR
 INTO HIS PARDONING ABOUT THAT?
 WE HEARD ABOUT THE PRESIDENT
 HAS CALLED HIM A GOOD MAN.
 FEELS BAD FOR HIM.
 YEAH.
 HE FEELS BAD FOR HIM.
 SO IT' ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THOUGH
 HE DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT TRACK
 RECORD IN THAT REGARD.
 IT IS TRUE IF YOU THINK ABOUT
 MANAFORT, IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
 HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY FROM
 HIDING DOLLARS FROM TAX
 AUTHORITIES IF HE HADN'T MET
 TRUMP.
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK OF WHERE
 WE ARE.
 WE HAVE A SITTING PRESIDENT, HIS
 CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR THOSE TWO
 CRITICAL MONTHS IS NOW GOING TO
 JAIL FOR TAX FRAUD AND BANK
 FRAUD.
 NOW THAT DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE
 NTL QUESTION OF THE MUELLER
 PROBE.
 BUT WHICH IS RUSSIAN
 INVOLVEMENT.
 BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO THE
 PRESIDENT'S JUDGMENT IN HIRING
 HIM, NOT LOOKING AT HIS PAST AND
 THEN OF COURSE WE FOUND OUT
 DURING THE PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE
 OF A MISTAKE IN THE COURT FILING
 THAT HE MET WITH CONTAIN TEEN
 KILIMNIK, A RUSSIAN OPERATIVE
 AND HAD ALLEGEDLY GIVEN HIM
 CAMPAIGN POLLING DATA.
 RIGHT.
 SO THAT WASN'T A PART OF WHAT
 HE WAS CONVICTED OF AND GOING TO
 JALG NOW.
 BUT THAT INFORMATION IS NOW OUT
 THERE AND IT HURTS THE
 PRESIDENT.
 WE HAVE TO SAY THAT IS
 SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE JUDGE
 SAID.
 AGAIN WHAT HE WAS SENTENCED FOR.
 ENGLISH SHA, QUICKLY, HOW'D THIS
 ALL -- FELISHA, WHERE IS THIS
 HEADING?
 SEVERAL CANDIDATES HAVE COME
 OUT TO USE THE MANAFORT
 SENTENCING TO MAKE THEIR CASE ON
 THE NEED FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 REFORM.
 I THINK THAT'S A DEBATE THAT'S
 ENERGIZED A LOT OF VOTERS IE
 DEMOCRATIC BASE RIGHT NOW.
 BRIAN MENTIONED BEYOND THE
 SENTENCE, ITSELF IS REALIZING
 THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY LEGAL
 WOES THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTING.
 WE IMAGINE THE MUELLER REPORT TO
 COME OUT ONE DAY THIS WEEK.
 THAT WILL ONLY BECOME A LEGAL
 MARASS FOR HIM.
 THE DEMOCRATS ARE INVESTIGATING
 HIM AND GOING BEYOND THE
 PRESIDENT, HIMSELF, TO EXAMINE
 FOR INSTANCE THE ALLEGATIONS OF
 MISCONDUCT IN GEORGIA WHEN IT
 COMES TO ISSUES OF VOTER RIGHTS
 THERE.
 THERE'S A LITTLE STILL
 PERCOLATING WE WILL HAVE TO TALK
 ABOUT IN THE FUTURE.
 THANKS, GUYS.
 2020 TENSION BETWEEN SANDERS
 CAMPAIGN STAFFERS AND CLINTON
 CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS.
 SO WHAT IS THE TRUTH?
 A FORMER CAMPAIGN INSIDER WILL
 JOIN US.
 A FORMER CAMPAIGN INSIDER WILL JOIN US.
  I Hear it in the Background and    she's Watching too, saying
     [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]

             [FRIEND]   I've never seen thatefore.


             I have...


    Since I'm a truck driver,        sometimes I'm gone
            for, like,      three weeks at a time.
  Even if I'm 3,000 miles away,
   I'm connected with my boys.
        Just pull on over,        see my son's game,
      and I'm having a ball.
      There when it matters.
      Buy the new Galaxy S10   and get a Galaxy S10e on us.
     Gentle means everything.
    So we improved everything.
  We used 50% fewer ingredients.
       Added one-handed pumps.
         And beat the top        safety standards.
            JOHNSON'S®
          Choose gentle.
            Termites,     feasting on homes 24/7.
        We're on the move.
              Roger.
      Hey Rick, all good?
      Oh yeah, we're good.
           We're good.
   Termites never stop trying to              get in,
  we never stop working to keep            them out.
            Terminix.        Defenders of Home.
 THE NATURE OF OUR CAMPAIGN IS NOT BELITTLING PEOPLE.
 IT'S NOT OPPOSITION RESEARCH.
 IMTS NOT ATTACKING OTHER PEOPLE.
 IT'S A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT
 THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 IF WE DO NOT WHEN I WILL
 STRONGLY SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATIC
 NOMINEE AND HOPE AND BELIEVE
 OTHERS FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME
 WAY.
 DONALD TRUMP MUST BE DEFEATED.
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATE BERNIE SANDERS
 SPEAKING A FEW MOMENTS AGO IN
 DESMOINES, IOWA, JOINING ME A
 FORMER SENIOR ADVISER.
 WELCOME TO YOU.
 WE WANT TO GET INTO THIS WITH
 YOU.
 WE HAVE THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
 QUOTING YOU SAYING YOU HAVE
 STRATEGIC DIFFERENCES WITH
 SANDERS AND HIS WIFE.
 WHAT HAPPENED TO MAKE YOU LEAVE?
 AS WE SAID IN A STATEMENT
 SET, WE FELT SANDERS HAD A
 CREATIVE VISION FOR THE
 CAMPAIGN.
 WE FELT WE WEREN'T ON THE SAME
 PAGE.
 WE WANTED TO STEP AWAY SO HE CAN
 PUT A TEAM AROUND HIM THAT
 SHARED THE DIRECTION HE WANT
 TODAY GO IN.
 I WANT TO SAY THIS IS VERY
 AMICABLE.
 WE LEFT THE SANDERS' CAMPAIGN ON
 A POSITIVE NOTE.
 WE ARE PROUD OF THE WORK WE DID
 FOR HIM IN 2016.
 I'M STILL VERY APPRECIATIVE OF
 HIM ALLOWING US TO BE A PART OF
 THAT CAMPAIGN.
 OKAY.
 LET'S GET TO WHAT THERE HAS BEEN
 A SLEW OF REPORTING ON, BOTH THE
 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FEUDING
 BETWEEN THE CLINTON AND CAMPAIGN
 STAFFERS.
 DID YOU SEE ANY OF THAT SAND
 WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE RIVALRY
 THAT MAKES IT' HARD TO LET IT
 GO?
 BEFORE I HAVE YOU ANSWER THAT IT
 STRUCK ME LISTENING TO BERNIE
 SANDERS THERE, IF HE SAID I DO
 NOT WIN, I WILL STRONGLY SUPPORT
 THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE.
 DO YOU THINK THE LEFTOVER
 RESENTMENT IS THE FACT THAT HE
 TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET AROUND
 TO THAT LAST GO AROUND?
 I DON'T AGREE.
 I THINK HE CAMPAIGNED HARD FOR
 HILLARY CLINTON IN THE LAST
 CAMPAIGN.
 DID HE DO IT AS SOON?
 WAS IT PRETTY EVIDENT HE WAS NOT
 GOING TO GET THE NOMINATION?
 I THINK HE SAID HE WAS GOING
 ULTIMATELY THROUGH THE PRIMARIES
 AND ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON NOT
 TOO LONG AFTER THAT WE PUT 2016
 IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR.
 WE FACED A THREAT AND DEMOCRATS
 NEED TO CENTRALIZE AROUND ONE
 FINAL IDEA WHICH IS WE FEED TO
 GET RID OF DONALD TRUMP.
 I THINK A LOT OF THIS ANIMOSITY
 FROM 2016, WE NEED TO LEAVE IT
 BEHIND.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL AGREE
 WITH YOU, GET RID OF DONALD
 TRUMP.
 IS THAT ENOUGH?
 IS THAT ENOUGH FOR DEMOCRATS TO
 RUN ON?
 THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE THEIR OWN
 PLATFORMS.
 ARE THEY MORE LEFT OR MORE
 PROGRESSIVE?
 SPEAK TO ALL THAT.
 I THINK ELIZABETH WARREN HAS
 A SHARP POSITIVE MESSAGE THAT'S
 RESONATEING.
 COREY BOOKER HAS A WEIDENAARTIVE
 HE IS TALKING ABOUT IT IN A WAY
 THAT MATTER TO AMERICAN MOTORS.
 I THINK CANDIDATES THAT ARE
 ABOUT TO ENTER THE FIELD I THINK
 BETO O'ROURKE COULD BE A HAVE A
 PARTY THAT WANTS TO CHANGE THE
 PAGE AND MOVE FORWARD.
 I THINK HE CAN BE A TREMENDOUS
 CANDIDATE.
 I THINK WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS
 FIELD OF CANDIDATES OUT THERE.
 LOOK.
 I THINK YOU KNOW THE NBC POLL
 SHOWS TRUMP IS IN A ROCKY PLACE
 TO BEGIN THE FINAL TWO YEARS AND
 RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
 ONLY 41% OF THE PUBLIC WANT TO
 VOTE FOR HIS RE-ELECTION.
 SO THAT'S A TOUGH PLACE FOR HIM
 TO BE IN.
 I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT FIELD OF
 CANDIDATES WITH POWERFUL
 MESSAGES.
 I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC WE CAN
 DEFEAT TRUMP IN 2020.
 COULD I LET YOU GO, THE LAST
 SIME TIME SANDERS RAN FOR
 PRESIDENT, DID HE EVER GO ABOUT
 DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF FROM
 OTHER CANDIDATES NOW THAT MIGHT
 HAVE SIMILAR POLICIES?
 I THINK IT'S A TESTAMENT TO
 SENATOR SANDERS THAT MUCH OF THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS MOVED IN
 HIS DIRECTION.
 I WILL SAY I THINK THE PARTY WAS
 MOVING TO THE LEFT OVER THE LAST
 DECADE.
 IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW
 AS WE WENT INTO THE LAST
 CAMPAIGN.
 I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY
 RECOGNIZED THE DEGREE THEY WERE
 MOVING TO THE LEFT.
 A LOT OF CANDIDATES HAVE MOVED
 INTO THAT SPACE ONLY MAKES SENSE
 BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ELECTORATE
 IS.
 IS HE ONLY A GRASS ROOTS GUY?
 I THINK HE IS A GRASS ROOTS
 GUY.
 KAMELA HARRIS WAS EFFECTIVE IN
 THE FIRST 24 HOURS OF HER
 CANDIDACY RAISING MONEY.
 LIKE I SAY, I THINK BETO
 O'ROURKE SHOULD HE GET IN, HE
 DISPLAYED IN TEXAS THE LAST
 GO-AROUND A HUGE ABILITY TO
 RAISE MONEY FROM SMALL DONORS
 AND ONLINE.
 I THINK SEVERAL OF THESE
 CANDIDATES WILL BE VERY, VERY
 COMPETITIVE IN TERMS OF THEIR
 ABILITY TO MUSTER GRASS ROOTS
 SUPPORT.
 I WILL SAY AS THEY CAMPAIGN
 ACROSS IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE,
 SOUTH CAROLINA, THEY'RE ALL
 DRAWING GREAT CROWDS, SO I THINK
 IT'S A PART OF THE ENTHUSIASM OF
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE
 DESIRE TO GET RID OF DONALD
 TRUMP AND WHERE HIS PARTY IS
 HEADED.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 YES, ABSOLUTELY.
 FOR PAUL MANAFORT, IT'S ONE
 DAY OF RECKONING IN THE BOOKS,
 STILL ANOTHER ONE TO BE WRITTEN.
 HOW WILL NEXT WEEK GO FOR THE
 DISGRACED CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN?
                             E DISGRACED CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN?
                             y ge
      when you can stay home
       with Neulasta Onpro?
   Strong chemo can put you at    risk of serious infection.
     In a key study Neulasta  reduced the risk of infection
         from 17% to 1%,
         a 94% decrease.
    Neulasta Onpro is designed       to deliver Neulasta
       the day after chemo
   and is used by most patients              today.
     Neulasta is for certain         cancer patients
  receiving strong chemotherapy.
  Do not take Neulasta if you're          allergic to it
    or Neupogen (filgrastim).
     An incomplete dose could     increase infection risk.
         Ruptured spleen,
    sometimes fatal as well as      serious lung problems,
       allergic reactions,
  kidney injuries and capillary   leak syndrome have occurred.
   Report abdominal or shoulder   tip pain, trouble breathing
     or allergic reactions to     your doctor right away.
     In patients with sickle         cell disorders,
 serious, sometimes fatal crises            can occur.
   The most common side effect     is bone and muscle ache.
     If you'd rather be home,
      ask your doctor about         Neulasta Onpro.
   Pay no more than $5 per dose         with copay card.
 THERE ARE NEW QUESTIONS
 TODAY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE
 CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN AFTER THE
 PRESIDENT'S REMARKS THAT SEEMED
 TO LEAVE A PARDON ON THE TABLE.
 LET'S ALL TAKE A LISTEN TO IT.
 I FEEL VERY BADLY FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 THE JUDGE SAID THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA I DON'T
 EVEN DISCUSS IT.
 THE ONLY ONE DISCUSSING IT IS
 YOU.
 I HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT.
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE
 NEVER RECOMMENDED A SPECIFIC
 SENTENCE.
 GUIDELINES CALLED FOR 19 TO 24
 YEARS.
 HE WAS SENTENCED TO 47 MONTHS,
 NOT EVEN FOUR YEARS.
 JOINING ME IS A PROFESSOR OF
 LAW, RATHER, AT THE UNIVERSITY
 OF MEMPHIS, STEVEN MULROY, THE
 AUTHOR OF "RETHINKING THE
 ELECTION LAW."
 SIR, WELCOME TO YOU.
 WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THE
 LENIENCE OF THIS SENTENCE?
 BECAUSE MICHAEL COHEN, LET'S
 POINT OUT, WHO HAS BEEN
 COOPERATING WITH PROSECUTORS.
 HEF GOT THREE YEARS.
 RIGHT?
 RIGHT.
 THAT'S A YEAR LESS THAN
 MANAFORT WHO WENT OUT OF HIS WAY
 TO IMPEDE THE INVESTIGATION AND
 LIED.
 YES.
 THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE TWO IS
 SOMEWHAT STRIKING ESPECIALLY
 BECAUSE AFTER AGREEING TO A PLEA
 AGREEMENT, MANAFORT THEN
 VIOLATED THAT BY LYING TO
 FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND ENGAGING
 IN WITNESS TAMPERING SO MUCH SO
 HE IS NOW IN CUSHION TOAD IN
 JAIL AWAITING HIS SENTENCE.
 I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S ON
 ONE HAND SURPRISING BECAUSE OF
 THE DISPARITY.
 ON THE OTHER HAND, NOT AS
 SURPRISING BECAUSE JUDGE ELLIS,
 A REAGAN APPOINTEE HAD BEEN
 SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS PROSECUTION
 FROM THE GET GO AND MADE
 COMMENTS REVEALING THAT
 SKEPTICISM.
 SO MAYBE IN HINDS SIGHT WE
 SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED.
 WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF
 THE PRESIDENT LEAVING A PARDON
 FOR MANAFORT?
 IS THAT HOW YOU LEAVE IT?
 YOU THINK HE'S THINKING, WELL,
 MAYBE?
 IF HE DOES PARDON HIM, WHAT CAN
 WE EXPECT?
 SO IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THE
 CASE THAT WHETHER TRUMP INTENDS
 TO PARDON HIM OR FOUGHT, WHETHER
 HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND, YOU KNOW,
 HIS LAWYER RUDY GUILIANI SAYS
 THAT SNUG IS BEING THOUGHT ABOUT
 REGARDING PARDONS.
 IT COULD BE THE CASE HE IS
 DANGLING THE POSSIBILITY OF A
 PARDON OUT THERE.
 I KNOW THIS, IF THERE IS A
 PARDON GRANTED, THERE IS AN
 INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW BY THE
 MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY ON
 STATE LEVEL FRAUD CHARGES AND
 TAX AVOIDANCE CHARGES AND THOSE
 CHARGES COULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY
 A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON.
 OKAY.
 WLOOBT THE PRESIDENT'S CLAIM --
 WHAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S
 CLAIM, YOU HARD IT THERE.
 THE JUDGE, JUDGE ELLIS, SAID
 THERE WAS NO COLLUSION WITH
 RUSSIA.
 LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS ONE
 MORE TIME.
 THE JUDGE SAID THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
 IT'S HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
 COLLUSION.
 THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.
 IT'S A COLLUSION HOAX.
 IT'S A COLLUSION WITCH HOAX.
 I DON'T CLUED WITH RUSSIA.
 THE JUDGE, I MEAN FOR WHATEVER
 REASON, I WAS VERY HONORED BY IT
 ALSO MADE THIS STATEMENT THAT
 THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
 SO THE PRESIDENT IS MIXING
 THINGS UP SHEER.
 ACCORDING TO COURT TRANSCRIPT,
 THE TRUTH IS THE JUDGE SAID
 MANAFORT IS NOT BEFORE THE COURT
 FOR ANY ALLEGATION THAT HE OR
 ANYBODY AT HIS DIRECTION CLUED
 WITH THE JUDGMENT.
 HE PUTS THIS TOGETHER THE JUDGE
 SAID THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.
 WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
 CASE FILINGS SUGGEST TO YOU ON
 ALL THIS?
 I MEAN YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.
 HE IS MIXING UP THE FEDERAL
 COURT DID NOT HAVE AN ELECTION
 JUDGE ELLIS MADE THAT POINT BUT
 THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE JUDGE
 WEIGHED IN ON COLLUSION, HE
 DIDN'T SPEAK TO IT AT ALL.
 TO CORN PLATE THE TWO IS
 OBVIOUSLY GROSSLY MISLEADING.
 OKAY.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 SEE YOU AGAIN, THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 IT IS THE BEST IMPACT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HAVING ON THE
 2020 CAMPAIGN SO FAR.
 DOES IT CLUE US IN ON WHO WILL
 WIN THE WHITE HOUSE?
 NOW TO SOARING DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM STILL A YEAR OUT TO
 FROM 2020 PRIMARIES.
 CANDIDATES ARE PACKING ONE
 CAMPAIGN STOP AFTER ANOTHER.
 THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS OUT WITH
 A NEW LOOK AT THE BEAT TRUMP
 VERROR AND REPORTS WHILE THE
 ENERGY HAS BEEN UPLIFTING FOR
 MANY CANDIDATES IT POSED
 SOMEWHAT OF A CHALLENGE TO STAGE
 EARLY STAGE POPULARITY.
 JOINING ME NOW, BILL PRESS, TALK
 SHOW HOST DANIEL MOODY MILLS AND
 NSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST.
 GLAD TO SEE ALL OF YOU.
 STILL, LADIES FIRST, PUT THIS IN
 PERSPECTIVE.
 THIS HIGH LEVEL INTEREST IN SO
 MANY DIFFERENT CANDIDATES.
 I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE VERY
 EXCITED RIGHT NOW ABOUT HAVING
 REAL SUBSTANTIVE POLICY
 QUESTIONS THAT CANDIDATES ARE
 BRINGING TO THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.
 THEY'RE ALL STRONG CONTENDERS.
 I'M NOT SURE WHO AT THIS VERY
 MOMENT I SEE ON THE DEBATE STAGE
 WITH
 I THINK THE TURNOUT PEOPLE ARE
 SEEING, WHETHER THEY BE TOWN
 HALLS, BIG STREET RALLIES IS
 VERY EXCITING AND I THINK THAT
 IT IS GOING TO HELP US CARRY ON
 FORWARD TO 2020 WITH A LOT OF
 FERVOR.
 I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THE
 GENTLEMEN BESIDE YOU WOULD PUT
 TRUMP AT THE TABLE WHEN IT IS
 SAID AND DONE.
 BILL, TALKING ABOUT THE STANDARD
 GAUGES FOR EXCITEMENT, CROWD
 SIZE AND NOISE, BUT IT IS
 DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH
 CANDIDATES.
 HOW DO YOU THINK CANDIDATES ARE
 EVALUATING CAMPAIGNS IN EARLY
 DAYS?
 ALEX, WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD THE
 FIRST DEBATE YET.
 THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO.
 IN 2018 THERE'S NO DOUBT, THE
 ENERGY AND MOMENTUM, ENTHUSIASM
 WAS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE,
 THERE WERE MORE DEMOCRATS
 RUNNING FOR OFFICE THAN BEFORE,
 TURNOUT WAS HIGHER THAN BEFORE,
 AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
 40 NEW MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES, I THINK SEVEN
 GOVERNORS ACROSS THE BOARD,
 HUNDREDS OF NEW STATE DEMOCRATIC
 LEGISLATORS.
 THAT ENERGY IS CONTINUING INTO


 THE FIELD IS CROWDED.
 WE KNOW THERE COULD BE MORE
 COMING IN, JOE BIDEN IS ON THE
 VERGE OF IT, MAYBE TERRY
 McCAULIFFE, BETO O'ROURKE, IT
 WILL TAKE TIME FOR THAT FIELD TO
 SORT OUT.
 NO DOUBT IT IS PAYING OFF IN
 TERMS OF HUGE CROWDS, SMALL
 DOLLAR DONATIONS UNHEARD OF
 BEFORE, AND IT IS AS LONG AS
 DEMOCRATS DON'T GET TOO COCKY,
 THEY HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT 2020.
 INTERESTING POINT, THAT LAST
 NIGHT.
 LET'S GO TO YOU, RICK.
 THERE'S A "THE WASHINGTON POST"
 COLUMN THAT'S TITLED EVERYONE IS
 UNDERESTIMATING TRUMP, IT COULD
 HURT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
 ALIKE.
 IN THIS ARTICLE IT ARGUES THAT
 REPUBLICANS SHOULD MAKE SURE
 THEY HAVE A PLAN FOR WHAT TO DO
 IF TRUMP WINS IN 2020.
 GIVEN THAT IT WILL BE HARDER FOR
 THE REST OF THE GOP TO ARGUE
 WITH THE TRUMPISTS.
 WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS?
 I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
 LOOK, TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE HIGH
 POPULARITY, BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING
 TO JUDGE THE 2020 CAMPAIGN BASED
 ON THEIR OWN ECONOMIC
 CONDITIONS.
 THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE.
 AND IF THEY BELIEVE THAT
 CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO SOMEHOW
 HURT THE ECONOMY, LET'S
 STIPULATE THAT TRUMP DOESN'T
 LEAD US INTO SOME NATIONAL
 DISASTER OR THE ECONOMY DOESN'T
 TANK BETWEEN NOW AND 2020 AND
 THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO BE GOOD
 AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW, THAT'S
 A TOUGH CASE TO MAKE, DESPITE
 TRUMP THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
 WANT TO FEEL SECURE THE ECONOMY
 WILL KEEP GOING.
 THE ECONOMY KEEPS GOING FOR FOUR
 YEARS OF TRUMP, THEY'RE GOING TO
 MAKE A CASE.
 TAKE ELIZABETH WARREN.
 SHE TALKED ABOUT BREAKING UP
 FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, APPLE, AND
 AMAZON.
 BUT I SHOULD REMIND VIEWERS THAT
 THE COMBINED VALUATION OF ALL
 THOSE COMPANIES IS ONE-EIGHTH OF
 WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS EVERY
 YEAR.
 IT IS A $4 TRILLION ENTERPRISE.
 IN FACT, IT OVERSPENDS EVERY
 YEAR TWICE THE VALUATION OF ALL
 THOSE COMPANIES, SO HOW IS
 ELIZABETH WARREN TELLING US THAT
 SHE WANTS TO MEDDLE IN PRIVATE
 SECTOR SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES WHEN
 IN FACT SHE SUPPORTS THE VERY
 POLICIES THAT CREATED THOSE
 CONSOLIDATIONS, NOT ONLY IN THE
 TECH AND BANKING INDUSTRY,
 BECAUSE SHE RAISES THE COST OF
 COMPLIANCE, KEEPING DOWN FUTURE
 COMPETITORS, SO ALL THAT MONEY
 IS CHASING COMPLIANCE AND NOT
 INNOVATION.
 BIG COMPANIES LOVE ELIZABETH
 WARREN, THEY CAN AFFORD THE
 COMPLIANCE, SMALL COMPETITORS
 CAN'T.
 FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T HEARD
 THAT SOUND BITE, LET'S PLAY
 ELIZABETH WARREN.
 AND DANIELLE I'LL HAVE YOU REACT
 TO IT.
 HERE IT IS.
 WE DON'T HAVE THE SOUND BITE.
 YOU MADE A GOOD POINT, YOU
 ARTICULATED IT WELL, RICK.
 DANIELLE, YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT
 THIS, IS IT SMART FOR ELIZABETH
 WARREN TO DO THAT, CREATING
 SPECIFIC TARGETS AS SHE
 CONTINUES TO TAKE ON BIG MONEY?
 I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY ON
 BRAND FOR ELIZABETH WARREN TO BE
 SAYING THAT SHE'S GOING TO TAKE
 ON BIG BUSINESS, THAT SHE HAS
 BEEN ONE OF THE CANDIDATES
 THAT'S BEEN OUT FRONT, TALKING
 ABOUT RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND
 WEALTH DISPARITY, HOW UNBALANCED
 OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS.
 GIVEN WHAT JUST TRANSPIRED
 AROUND AMAZON IN NEW YORK AND
 DECIDING NOT TO COME, REGARDLESS
 OF ALL OF THE TAX INCENTIVES
 THAT ARE BEING THROWN AT THEM,
 WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE OF WHETHER
 OR NOT THEY WERE GOING TO
 ACTUALLY EMPLOY PEOPLE THAT WERE
 IN NEW YORK FOR SUSTAINABLE
 UNEMPLOYMENT AT AMAZON, THERE
 WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE
 GIVEN TO COMPANIES WITHOUT A LOT
 OF RETURN.
 I THINK WHAT ELIZABETH WARREN IS
 BRINGING UP TO THE SURFACE IS WE
 CAN'T GET INTO A SITUATION WE
 DID WITH THE BANKS, RIGHT, AND
 COMPANIES THAT ARE TOO BIG TO
 FAIL, THAT WE NEED TO PUT ALL
 OUR RESOURCES, GIVE THEM
 EVERYTHING THEY NEED BECAUSE NOW
 CITIES AND STATES ARE AT THE
 WILL OF BIG TECH COMPANIES AND
 WHAT THEY WANT AND NEED.
 I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME
 TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY, SOME TYPE
 OF OVERSIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE
 GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER AND
 BIGGER, AND ELIZABETH WARREN IS
 WELL AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
 YOU ALLOW COMPANIES TO RUN
 AMUCK, RIGHT, AND GO
 UNCHALLENGED BECAUSE OH, THEY'RE
 THE BIGGEST EMPLOYERS.
 SO BILL, DID YOU HEAR THE
 EXCHANGE ON MORNING JOE WITH
 HICKENLOOPER?
 I DID.
 AND HICKENLOOPER HAD A HARD
 TIME SELF IDENTIFYING AS A
 CAPITALIST, SAYING HE BELIEVED
 IN CAPITALISM.
 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?
 LET ME JUST SAY, I DIDN'T
 THINK JOHN HICKENLOOPER WAS A
 SERIOUS CONTENDER, NOW I KNOW
 HE'S NOT OR CERTAINLY NOT READY
 FOR PRIME TIME.
 LOOK, WE KNOW THERE HAVE TO BE
 LIMITS ON, RESTRICTIONS ON GOOD
 REGULATIONS, NO CHILD LABOR,
 GOOD STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL
 PROTECTION, BUT I DON'T THINK
 ANY OF US SHOULD HESITATE TO SAY
 WE ARE A CAPITALIST OR THAT
 CAPITALISM WORKS, IT IS OUR
 SYSTEM.
 IT WORKED FOR A LONG TIME.
 PROPERLY REGULATED, PROPERLY
 CONTAINED, NOTHING WRONG IN
 SAYING YES, I'M A CAPITALIST.
 RICK, I WANT TO GET PERSONAL
 BEFORE WE WRAP IT UP.
 I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE
 ARTICLE IN THE "DAILY BEAST,"
 TITLED VENFUL TRUMP IS BLACK
 BAWLING DISLOIL CONSERVATIVE
 OPERATIVES LIKE RICK TYLER.
 IS IT IMPACTING YOUR WORK?
 YOU GAVE ME A POWERFUL SOUND
 BITE LAST SATURDAY, AND I
 REITERATED IT MANY TIMES, PLAYED
 IT OTHER TIMES THROUGH THE
 WEEKEND.
 I WAS HONORED TO BE BLACK
 BALD BY THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE.
 AND THIS TOO SHALL PASS.
 ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO IS GET
 GOOD CONSERVATIVES ELECTED TO
 CONGRESS.
 DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WANT GOOD
 CONSERVATIVES ELECTED, THAT'S
 HIS CHOICE.
 HE'LL MOVE ON.
 THAT'S IT.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
 THANK YOU.
