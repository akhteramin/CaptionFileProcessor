 BUT NOW, MELISSA FRANCIS IS IN
 FOR HARRIS.
 Melissa: FOX NEWS ALERT,
 JOE BIDEN IS SET TO ANNOUNCE
 ANOTHER RUN FOR THE WSE
 ON THURSDAY.
 WELCOME TO
 "OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME."
 I'M MELISSA FRANCIS IN TODAY FOR
 HARRIS FAULKNER.
 FOX NEWS CAN NOW CONFIRM THAT
 JOE BIDEN WILL MAKE HIS
 CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENCY
 OFFICIAL IN TWO DAYS IN AN
 ONLINE VIDEO.
 SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE
 PLANNING SAY THE FORMER
 VICE PRESIDENT WILL ALSO MAKE AN
 APPEARANCE ON MONDAY INffo■PITT.
 ñ■LD WHEREñññññ■■V■■■■■■■■■■■Ñ■■
 PAOGRESSIVE IDEAS WERE
 FRONT AND CENTER DURING A SERIES
 OF 2020 TOWN HALLS LAST NIGHT,
 INCLUDING ELIZABETH WARREN
 ANNOUNCING Ajjj TO CANCEL
 EXIS STUDENT DEBT■jjjj■■■■■jj■jF
 CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT IN HER
 FIRST 100 DAYS.
 AND BERNIE SANDERS DEFENDING HIS
 STANCE TO GRANT VOTING RIGHTS TO
 CRIMINALS WHILE THEY ARE IN
 PRISON, INCLUDING THE BOSTON
 MARATHON■■G■
 JUST DAYS AFTER THE SIXTH
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATTACK.
 PETER DOOCY HAS MORE ON ALL OF
 THIS FROM WASHINGTON.
 IT'S HEATING UP, PETER.
 MELISSA, A VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENT
 ON THURSDAY MORNING AND A
 PITTSBURGH RALLY ON MONDAYx■x■tD
 AT■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■.
 IN 1988 HE DROPPED OUT EARLY AND
 NEVER MADE IT TO THE PRIMARIES,
 AMID A PLAGIARISM SCANDAL.
 IN 2008 OUT AFTER IOWA
 AND LATER BECAME BARACK OBAMA'S
 RUNNING MATE.
 IN 2019 HE'S HOPING FOR BETTER
 AGAINST A FIELD WHERE THE NUMBER
 ONE DECLARED CANDIDATE RIGHT NOW
 IS BERNIE SANDERS.
 WHO DOES NOT SEEM CONCERNED THAT
 PRIMARY OPPONENTS OR MAYBE EVENE
 HIS DEFENSE OF THE BOSTON
 BOMBER'S RIGHT TO VOTE AGAINST
 HIM.
 MY FOLLOW-UP QUESTION GOES TO
 THIS, YOU'D LIKE YOU ARE
 OPPOSITION AT AGAINST YOU BY SAN
 BOMBER SHOULD DO IT.
 NOT AFTER HE PAYS HIS DEBT TO
 SOCIETY, BUT WHILE HE'S IN JAIL.
 ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
 I THINK I HAVE WRITTEN MANY
 30-SECOND OPPOSITION ADS
 THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.
 KAMALA HARRIS LATER SAID
 ABOUT DEATH OR INMATES WOULD
 ENCUMBER THAT SHE SUPPORTS
 HAVING THAT CONVERSATION.
 THE CALIFORNIA SENATOR MADE A
 BIGGER SPLASH ABOUT EXECUTIVE
 ACTION ON GUN CONTROL WITHIN THE
 FIRST 100 DAYS OF TAKING OFFICE,
 IF SHE DOES, AND CONGRESS
 DOESN'T ACT.
 I WILL REQUIRE THAT FOR ANY
 GUN DEALER THAT BREAKS THE LAW,
 THE ETF TAKE THEIR LICENSE.
 BY THE WAY, ATF -ALCOHOL,
 TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS -THEY'VE
 BEEN DOING A LOT OF E AND T BUT
 NOT MUCH OF F.
 WE NEED TO FIX THAT.
 ELIZABETH WARREN TO TRY TO
 SEW A DIFFERENT POLICY.
 CANCELING STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR
 40 MILLION PEOPLE COME UP TO
 $50,000 A POP, PLUS MAKING
 PUBLIC COLLEGE TUITION FREE.
 WHICH SHE SAYS WOULD BE FUNDED
 BY A TAX ON ULTRA MILLIONAIRES
 WHO SHE HAS GOT A MESSAGE FOR.
 YOU ARE PROTECTED IN YOUR
 FACTORIES WITH FIREFIGHTERS AND
 POLICE OFFICERS THAT ALL OF US
 HELPED TO PAY.
 WE SAY, "GOOD FOR YOU, THAT YOU
 HAVE NOW GOTTEN THIS GREAT
 FORTUNE.
 BUT, TWO SENT TOES -PAY BACK
 SO EVERYBODY ELSE GETS A
 CHANCE."
 WARREN AND TARA SAID LAST
 NIGHT THEY SUPPORT EFFORTS IN
 THE HOUSE TO TRY
 G■ AND IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 MELISSA CUSTOM XP ONE FOR MORE
 ON ALL THE SPLITS BRING ABOUT
 QSAR, EDITOR AND
 CHIEF
 EDITOR IN CHIEF OF
 THE HILL. LET'S TALK ABOUT JOE BIDEN DOING
 THE VIDEO ANNOUNCED ON
 WEDNESDAY.
 GOING IN MAKING THAT APPEARANCE.
 LICKING THE PARENTS PERSONALLY.
 WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT?
 DIRECTION OF MINE IS,
 "FINALLY."
 HE HAS BEEN HEMMING AND HAWING.
 I RAN INTO A MONOPLANE LAST FALL
 AND HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE A
 DECISION.
 HE HAS CONTINUALLY POSTPONED IT.
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, THE LAST
 COUPLE MONTHS HE'S BEEN RUNNING.
 HE ASSEMBLED A TEAM.
 MELISSA, I THINK WILL BE
 FASCINATING TO SEE WHERE HE
 STANDS ON MEDICARE FOR ALL, ON
 THE GREEN NEW DEAL, ON A FREE
 TUITION.
 ABOLISH ICE.
 ALL THESE THINGS OF THE LEFT
 WANTS.
 WHERE DO YOU STAND?
 Melissa: THERE IS SOME ROOM
 IN THEIR TO BE THE PERSON WHO IS
 NOT LUNGING TO THE LEFT.
 IF YOU SAW THE CATALOG OF
 SOUND BITES HE PLAYED AHEAD OF
 TIME, IT SEEMS LIKE AS THEY
 SCOOT FURTHER AND FURTHER, THERE
 IS THIS OPEN FIELD ON THE OTHER
 SO HE CAN WALK INTO.
 THE QUESTION BECOMES IF YOU
 DON'T EMBRACE THOSE THINGS, DO
 YOU GET OUT OF THE PRIMARY ON
 TOP?
 THAT'S A FASCINATING THING
 I'M LOOKING FOR.
 WILL HE SAY, "WE CAN'T DO ALL
 THIS.
 WE CAN'T AFFORD IT, WE CAN DO
 BOLD THINGS, BUT WE HAVE TO PICK
 A SPOT."
 REMEMBER, MEDICARE FOR ALL
 DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES IN THE
 CONGRESS, NEVER DOES THE GREEN
 NEW DEAL PAID WITH A BACKLASH BE
 SEVERE FROM THE LEFT?
 WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE PARTY HAS
 MOVED LEFT.
 BERNIE SANDERS WROTE THE
 PLATFORM IN 2016 AND NOW, AS HE
 SAYS, THEY ARE MORE MAINSTREAM.
 BERNIE SANDERS OF COURSE IS TO
 THE LEFT OF MOST OF THE PAR÷■÷■g
 SEEMS TO AUTHENTICALLY STICK
 WHEREVER IT IS THAT HE PUTS DOWN
 HIS MARKER AS OPPOSED TO THOSE
 WHO WILL BE QUESTIONED ABOUT,
 "YOU USED TO BELIEVE THIS AND I
 SAVED YOU BELIEVE THIS.
 HOW SINCERE DO WE THINK YOU
 MORE?"
 EVEN WHEN PRESSED REPLACE THE
 SOUND BITE
 ABOUT THE BUS AND THERE IS A BUMMER.
 HAS
 THE HE SAYS HE HAS WRITTEN A LOT OF OPPOSITION ADS IN HIS TIME IN
 THE SENATE.
 SOMEONE ASKED HIM ABOUT THEIR
 FAMILY WHO LEFT SOVIET RUSSIA
 AND THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH
 SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM.
 HE WAS THE QUESTION AND ANSWER.
 MY FAMILY LEFT SOVIET RUSSIA
 IN 1979 FLEEING FROM SOME OF THE
 VERY SAME SOCIALIST POLICIES YOU
 SEEM EAGER TO IMPLEMENT IN THIS
 COUNTRY.
 MY QUESTION IS HOW YOU RECTIFY
 YOUR NOTION OF DEMOCRATIC
 SOCIALISM WITH THE FAILURES OF
 SOCIALISM IN NEARLY EVERY
 COUNTRY THAT HAS TRIED IT.
 IS IT YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT I
 SUPPORTED OR BELIEVE IN A FAIR
 TRAIN COMMUNISM THAT EXISTED IN
 SOVIET UNION?
 I DON'T.
 I OPPOSED IT.
 I BELIEVE IN A VIGOROUS
 DEMOCRACY.
 Melissa: WHAT DID YOU THINK
 OF THAT ANSWER?
 BERNIE SANDERS IS GOOD.
 HE HAS BEEN IN CONGRESS AND T
 IN■ ANS■L■LNLM■@■@ERIN THAT SITN
 AT HALL.■L■L■L■L■L■L■L THINK T■E
 HELPED THEM.
 IT'S GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO
 SEE THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN HIM AND
 BERNIE SANDERS.
 THEY ARE TWO ELDER STATEMENT IN
 THE PARTY.
 THEY OVERLAPPED IN THE SENATE
 FOR TWO YEARS.
 BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DIAMETRICALLY
 OPPOSED ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES,
 WHETHER IT WAS0L THE, THE
 IRAQ WAR.
 BERNIE COULD GO A ON
 ■■■■■ FRONTS.
 MOSTLY POSITIVE, AS HE DID IN

 I THINK THAT DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE
 TWO MEN IS GOING TO BE ONE TO
 WATCH IN THE COMING MONTHS.
 Melissa: IN THE MEANTIME,
 POURING A LOT OF COLD WATER ON
 THE WHOLE ENTIRE THING,
 MITCH MCCONNELL TALKING ABOUT
 HOW HE WOULD WELCOME THIS
 SOCIALISM.
 LOOK AT THIS.
 THE MAJORITY OF THE SENATE
 NEXT YEAR, NONE OF THOSE THINGS
 ARE GOING TO PASS THE SENTENCE.
 THEY WON'T EVEN BE VOTED ON.
 SO THINK OF ME AS THE GRIM
 REAPER.
 [LAUGHTER]
 BECAUSE I AM GOING TO MAKE SURE
 THAT SOCIALISM DOESN'T LAND ON
 THE PRESIDENT'S DESK.
 Melissa: I MEAN, IS THAT
 GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS?
 GRIM REAPER -DO SOUND LIKE YOU
 ARE OLD AND OLD-FASHIONED IN THE
 OLD PARTY?
 ALL THE KIDS LIKE THE NEWFANGLED
 STUFF.
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE
 HEARD HER TELL MIKE A POLITICIAN
 REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS THE GRIM
 REAPER, BUT IT WORKS WITH THE
 BASE.
 HE HAS FACED PRIMARY CHALLENGES
 BEFORE.
 I THINK HE IS GOING TO ENDORSE
 MITCH MCCONNELL, AND THAT WILL
 PREVENT A SCARE OF A
 PRIMARY CHALLENGE.
 THEN HE LAUGHED AND WERE ABOUT
 THE GENERAL AND THE MAJORITY IN
 THE SENATE.
 THIS IS HIS PAGE.
 LISTEN, IF YOU REELECT
 REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE, WE'LL
 STOP THESE IDEAS WHICH HE SAYS
 ARE CRAZY.
 IT'S JUST A FEW PEOPLE -A LOT
 OF PEOPLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY SUPPORT THEM.
 Melissa: BOB CUES ACT,
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 THANKS, MELISSA
 MY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND MY CLIENTS ALL DESERVE TO HAVE
 THEIR REPUTATIONS RESTORED.
 THAT'S WHY TODAY WE ARE TAKING
 ACTION.
 IN FEDERAL COURT, LET ME MAKE
 ONE THING PERFECTLY CLEAR.
 THE CHICAGO BROTHERS TOLD THE
 TRUTH.
 Melissa: THE BROTHERS
 ACCUSED OF ATTACKING
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT IN JANUARY HAVE
 ANNOUNCED THEY ARE SUING THE
 EMPIRE ACTORS ATTORNEYS FOR
 DEFAMATION.
 HIS LEGAL TEAM HAS SAID THE
 BROTHERS CARRIED OUT A VIOLENT
 HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK AGAINST THEIR
 CLIENTS.
 WITH THE BROTHERS ALLEGE THAT
 SMOLLETT PAID THEM TO HATEIME.
 AND NOW THEY WANT TO RESTORE
 THEIR REPUTATIONS.
 MIKE TOBIN IS LIVE ON CHICAGO
 WITH MORE IN THIS ONE.
 IT'S A NEW WRINKLE EVERY DAY.
 IT GETS COPULATED.
 THE ATTACK WAS
 HOAXED,
 CONCEIVED AS MELISSA MENTIONED, IT DOES NOT MENTION THE EMPIRE
 ACTOR AS A DEFENDANT.
 RATHER, THE SUIT IS DIRECTED AT
 THE HIGH-PROFILE LEGAL TEAM.
 ATTORNEY MARK ERRICO'S DID THE
 ROUNDS ON NEWS PROGRAMS AND
 PODCASTS
 THE SUIT CLAIMS THE LAWYERS SAID THINGS THAT WERE
 FALSE, BLAMING THE ATTACKS ON THE OSUNDAIRO BROTHERS PRAY THAT
 THEY HAD EXECUTED HATE CRIME.
 THEY WERE WHITE FACE.
 HE CLAIMS THE STATEMENTS WERE
 DAMAGING TO THE REPUTATIONS AND
 BUSINESS OF THE BROTHERS AND
 CAUSE THEM EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.
 THEY ARE SEEKING PUNITIVE
 DAMAGES AS WELL AS COURT COSTS.
 THEIR ATTORNEY GLORIA SCHMIDT
 SAYS THE SUIT IS ABOUT CLEARING
 THE ROTATION OF THE BROTHERS AS
 WELL AS THE CITY OF CHICAGO.
 SHE READ A PREPARED STATEMENT
 FROM THE BROTHERS.
 WE HAVE SAT BACK AND WATCHED
 LIE AFTER LIE BEING FABRICATED
 ABOUT US IN THE METED.
 ONLY SO ONE BIG LIE CAN CONTINUE
 TO HAVE LIFE.
 THESE LIES ARE DESTROYING OUR
 CHARACTER AND OUR REPUTATION AND
 OUR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL
 LIFE.
 ON APRIL 16TH, ON THE PODCAST
 "UNREASONABLE DOUBT," ONE LAWYER
 SAID THAT ONE OF THE BROTHERS
 ENGAGED IN HOMOSEXUAL ACTS WITH
 SMOLLETT.
 HE SAID IT'S FALSE.
 BACKGROUND
 A THEORY FOR WHY THE BROTHERS WOULD HAVE ATTACKED THE ACTOR IF
 IT WAS NOT AT HIS DIRECTION.
 AND THE STORY FLOATED BY THE
 SOURCE FROM THE SMOLLETT TEAM IS
 THAT ONE BROTHER WAS WORRIED THE
 OTHER WAS■+ ■ + ■#■#E###■■■E■■ .
 Melissa: WAS BRINGING THE
 FORMERICT ATTORNEY.
 F ALL THIS
 CASE HAS A CHANCE?
 HE IS SUING THE LAWYERS.
 WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
 THAT?
 THEY ARE SUING THE LAWYERS, I■
 SHOULD SAY
 ANY RESPONSIBLE PROSECUTOR
 WHO IS GOING TO DISMISS CHARGES
 AGAINST SOMEONE LIKE
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT REALLY SHOULD
 HAVE MADE HIM PAY FULL
 RESTITUTION BUT ALSO ADMIT
 RESPONSIBILITY.
 WHETHER HE HAS TO PLAYED GUILTY
 OR
 NOT IS NOT THE POINT. THEREAFTER ADMIT RESPONSIBILITY
 AND WE WOULDN'T BE THERE.
 THE LAWYERS OR NOBODY ELSE WOULD
 BE ABLE TO GO OUT IN THE MEDIA.
 AS THIS LAWSUIT HAS ALLEGED, TO
 SAY THINGS LIKE THESE GUYS
 COMMITTED A CRIMINAL HOMOPHOBIC
 ATTACK.
 THEY ARE SAYING THAT THOSE WORDS
 WERE FALSE AND THAT THEY YOU
 DAMAGED THE REPUTATION.
 NOW THAT THIS DEFAMATION CASE
  MELISSA, THEY
 CAN GO INTO COURT AND PROVE THAT
 WHAT THEY SAID WAS ACTUALLY
 TRUE.
 IF THEY CAN.
 IF THEY CAN, IT WOULD BE AN
 ABSOLUTE DEFENSE.
 WHETHER OR NOT THEIR REPUTATION
 HAS BEEN HARMED.
 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THESE
 GUYS WHO ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE
 BEEN -LET'S JUST CALL IT THE
 SHAM, ALLEGED BY THE
 PROSECUTORS.
 EXCUSE ME, BY THE POLICE
 DEPARTMENT IN CHICAGO.
 IF THEY WERE PART OF SOME KIND
 OF A MUCH MORE COULD
 YOU REALISTICALLY DAMAGE THE
 REPUTATION?
 Melissa: WELL, THEY SAY
 THEY ARE NOT GF A HATE
 CRIME.
 THEY ARE GUILTY OF A SHAM CRIME.
 SO I GUESS THAT WOULD BE -THAT
 TRYING TO MAKE.CE THAT THEY ARE
 WE HAVE -TO US, THERE'S NOT A
 BIG DIFFERENCE.
 TO THEM, THERE OBVIOUSLY IS.
 IS THERE A CHANCE THAT THROUGH
 THIS PROCESS SOMEHOW SMOLLETT IS
 FORCED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY,
 AS YOU SAID, IF THAT'S REALLY
 WHAT HAPPENED?
 BECAUSE HE STILL MAINTAINS THAT
 IT'S NOT HOW THINGS WENT DOWN.
 THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM IN ALL
 THIS.
 I THINK CLEARLY IF THIS CASE
 EVER MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE
 COURTROOM OR EVEN INTO
 DEPOSITIONS, JUSSIE SMOLLETT MAY
 HAVE TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH AS A
 WITNESS IN THIS CIVIL CASE.
 LET'S KEEP IN MIND, THE CITY OF
 CHICAGO IS ALSO GOING AFTER
 SMOLLETT CIVILLY.
 SO■ IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HIS
 VERSION OF THE EVENTS COULD BE
 LOCKED DOWN IN SWORN TESTIMONY.
 IN EITHER ONE OF THESE TYPES OF
 AVENUES.
 EVEN THOUGH THE PROSECUTOR, IN
 MY OPINION, DROPPED THE BALL BY
 NOT MAKING HIM ACCEPT
 RESPONSIBILITY IN A CRIMINAL
 COURT ROOM, HE MAY VERY WELL
 HAVE TO ANSWER TO THIS IN A
 CIVIL COURT ROOM.
 EVEN IF IT IS AS A WITNESS FOR
 EITHER THE PLAINTIFFS OR THE
 DEFENDANTS IN THIS DEFAMATION
 LAWSUIT.
 Melissa: THAT WOULD BE THE
 GAME CHANGER.
 IF HE WAS BROUGHT INTO A
 COURTROOM OR DEPOSITION
 TYPESETTING AND HE HAD TO SAY
 UNDER OATH WHAT HAPPENED.
 HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE CHOICE
 IF YOU LIES UNDER OATH OR
 CONTINUES WITH HIS STAR IF, IN
 FACT, IT IS FALSEHOOD.
 AT THAT POINT HE WOULD FACE THE
 CONSEQUENCES, IF HE CONTINUES TO
 LIE CUSTOMER GOURD YOU HAVE TOAD
 IT STILL KEEPS GOING?
 RIGHT.
 IN MY OPINION, THESE LAWYERS ON
 HIS BEHALF SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
 THEIR SWEETHEART DISMISSAL AND
 JUST GOT HOME AND BEEN THANKFUL
 FOR IT.
 INSTEAD THEY WENT OUT ACCORDING
 TO THIS LAWSUIT AND MADE VARIOUS
 MEDIA APPEARANCES WHERE THEY
 SAID THESE THINGS ALLEGED TO BE
 FALSE AND DEFAMATORY.
 BY GETTING JUSSIE SMOLLETT IN
 COURT AS A WITNESS, HE IS NOT
 GOING TO BE ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND
 PAID SPOKESPERSONS.
 BECAUSE AFTER THE CASES ARE
 OVER, THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT
 THE LAWYERS ARE.
 THEY ARE A P.R. TEAM FOR
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT.
 THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND
 THAT.
 IF HE HAS TO GO INTO COURT UNDER
 OATH AND TESTIFY, HE'S GOT TO
 TELL THE TRUTH.
 IF HE DOESN'T COME HE
 THEORETICALLY OPEN HIMSELF UP TO
 ADDITIONAL PROSECUTION.
 Melissa: THAT COULD BE THE
 BASIS FOR THIS, TRYING TO GET
 HIM OUT FROM BEHIND WHAT IS NOW
 HIS P.R. TEAM.
 VERY INTER■■G■.
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, WE
 APPRECIATE IT.
 HAPPY TO BE HERE ANY TIME.
 Melissa: THE TERM IN THE
 ADMINISTRATION AND THE HIGHEST
 COURT IN THE LAND AS JUSTICES
 CONSIDER WHETHER TO ADD A
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE 2020
 CENSUS.

 BREWING IN THE SUPREME COURT.

 AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN THIS AT
 THE TAKE PLACE ON THURSDAY.
 THIS IS ACCORDING TO A KREMLIN
 OFFICIAL.
 THE TWO ARE EXPECTED TO MEET IN
 EASTERN RUSSIA ALONG ITS PACIFIC
 COAST.
 RUSSIAN NEWS AGENCIES REPORT
 THAT THE TALKS WILL CENTER ON
 NORTS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
 AND A FOX NEWS ALERT, HOUSE
 JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
 JERRY NADLER HAS SUBPOENAED
 FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL
 DON MCGAHN, CALLING ON HIM TO
 TESTIFY PUBLICLY NEXT MONTH ON
 POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
 RELATED INCIDENTS OUTLINED IN
 THE MUELLER REPORT.
 HOGAN GIDLEY SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS
 ARE GETTING DESPERATE.
 DEMOCRATS LIKE JERRY NADLER
 CONTINUE TO TRY AND ATTACK THIS
 PRESIDENT AND ATTACK MEMBERS OF
 THIS ADMINISTRATION REPEATEDLY.
 HE IS NOT GOING TO LEARN
 ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT DON MCGAHN
 OR THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT
 BOB MUELLER DIDN'T FIND IN TWO
 YEARS OF WASTED TIME AND ENERGY.
 THE ONLY THING HE'S GOING TO
 AGAIN, QUITE FRANKLY, OUR MAY BE

 B■■■■E
 SECOND.
 FIRST OF ALL, SOME■■■ NEWS MADEA
 LITTLE WHILE AGO.
 JARED KUSHNER WEIGHING IN FOR
 THE FIRST TIME ON THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION AT THAT TIME 100
 FORM.
 BOB MUELLER'S INTEREST IN
 JARED KUSHNER WAS THAT JUNE 9TH
 2016 MEETING WITH THE WOMAN ON
 THE LEFT.
 A RUSSIAN ATTORNEY.
 IN THE REPORT, HE SAID THAT
 INVESTIGATORS CONSIDERED WHETHER
 THAT MAY HAVE CONSTITUTED AN
 ILLEGAL FOREIGN CAMPAIGN
 CONTRIBUTION BUT ULTIMATELY
 DECIDED THEY COULD NOT DETERMINE
 WHETHER SHE WAS OFFERING
 ANYTHING OF VALUE.
 HERE IS WHAT KUSHNER SAID ABOUT
 HIS PARTICIPATION WITH THE
 OFFICE AND SPECIAL COUNSEL.
 LISTEN HERE.
 WHEN THE WHOLE NOTION OF THE
 RUSSIA COLLUSION NARRATIVE CAME
 UP, I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO
 SAY I'M HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE
 WITH ANY INVESTIGATIONS.
 AT THIS POINT I'VE DONE THREE
 HOUSE INTERVIEWS, ABOUT NINE
 HOURS WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL.
 IF YOU LOOK AT MY STATEMENT FROM
 JULY, I PUT OUT ABOUT 12 PAGES
 OF STATEMENT EXPLAINING THESE
 DIFFERENT THINGS.
 I THINK EVERYTHING I SAID IS
 PROVEN TO BE TRUE AND IT'S BEEN
 VERY THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED.
 THE ONE THING THE MUELLDDDDDDD@E
 RUSSIA COLLUSION HAV■■■■■■■■■■■N
 DEMOCRACY FOR MORE■■ THAN RUSSIA
 AT THE SAME TIME AT THAT GOING

 WHITE HOUSE ON HOW THEY WILL
 RESPOND TO THE SUBPOENA ISSUED
 YESTERDAY BY JERROLD NADLER TO
 GET DON MCGAHN, THE FORMER
 WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, UP IN FRONT
 OF HIS COMMITTEE.
 IN A STATEMENT, JERROLD NADLER'S
 INCOME "DON McCANN IS A
 CRITICAL WITNESS TO MANY OF THE
 ALLEGED INCIDENCES OF
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND OTHER
 MISCONDUCT DESCRIBED IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT."
 CENTRAL ISSUE IS WHETHER THE
 PRESIDENT CAN ASSERT EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE AND PREVENT DONE
 MCGANN FROM TESTIFYING.
 THE PRESIDENT DID NOT EXERT A
 NEGATIVE PRIVILEGE OVER RELEASES
 OF PART OF THE MUELLER REPORT
 THAT INCLUDED TESTIMONY FROM
 DON MCGAHN, THERE WAS NO
 ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND AM
 TO GO BACK AND MAKE THAT CHANGE
 NOW WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC IN
 COURT.
 THERE IS AA÷ SENIOR
 WHITE HOUSE AIDES REFUSING TO
 TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS.
 FIRST AND FOREMOST AMONG THEM IS
 CARL KLEIN WHO WAS THE FORMER
 DIRECTOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE
 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL SECURITY.
 HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE A
 DEPOSITION TODAY ON
 CAPITOL HILL.
 HE WAS TOLD BY THE WHITE HOUSE
 TO IGNORE THE SUBPOENA AND NOW
 ELIJAH CUMMINGS, THE CHAIRMAN OF
 THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE,
 IS THREATENING TO HOLD THEM IN
 CONTEMPT.
 MICHAEL FLYNN ALSO DID NOT
 TESTIFY, NEITHER DID KARL ROVE
 DURING THE BUSH■=■=■=■=■=■=■=■==
 GOINGRLY■1■u■u■u■u■u■u■u■u■u■u■Y
 KISSINGER.
 THERE'S ALSO A RICH HISTORY OF
 AIDS, EVEN PRESIDENTS,
 TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS.
 INCLUDING GERALD FORD, WHO BACK
 IN 1974 APPEARED BEFORE CONGRESS
 TO TALK ABOUT HIS PARDON OF
 NIXON.
 PAT BUCHANAN AND AL HAIG
 TESTIFIED ABOUT WATERGATE,
 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS,
 SPECIAL COUNSEL TO
 PRESIDENT CLINTON, A NUMBER OF
 CLINTON-ERA STAFF MEMBERS WHO
 TESTIFIED, ALL THE WAY UP TO
 STEVE BANNON FROM THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION WHO TESTIFIED
 AFTER HE WAS DELIVERED A
 SUBPOENA TO APPEAR BEFORE
 CONGRESS.
 BACK IN 2,080 FEDERAL JUDGE
 RULED THAT THEN-BUSH WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL HARRIET MIERS AND THE
 CHIEF OF STAFF, JOSH BOLDEN,
 WERE NOT IMMUNE FROM
 CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS, EITHER.
 THEY GOT TO COME UP, MELISSA,
 WITH SOMETHING VERY CREATIVE
 HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN ORDER
 FOR A JUDGE TO SAY, "YOU ARE
 RIGHT, McGAHN SHOULD NOT
 COMPLY WITH THAT SUBPOENA."
 HIS TESTIFY IS SCHEDULED.
 WE'LL SEE WHAT■■APPENS.
 Melissa: NEED A FANTASTIC
 JOB SETTING THE TABLE FOR US AND
 WE APPRECIATE IT.
 LET'S GET THE DISCUSSION THAT HE
 SET UP.
 FORMER COVERS MATERIAL ICE IS
 WITH US.
 HE'S A REPUBLICAN FROM
 CALIFORNIA WHO OF COURSE SERVED
 ON THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES.
 SARAH, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK THAT
 McGAHN SHOULD APPEAR OR
 REFUSE?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 CLEARLY HE WILL APPEAR.
 WHEN I THINK IS IMPORTANT --
 BECAUSE YOU SET UP A NUMBER OF
 THESE, THE BATES DECISION WHICH
 OCCURRED UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH
 AND THEN AMY BERMAN JACKSON IN
 THE FAST AND FURIOUS CASE THAT
 HE CURED UNDER OBAMA, THOSE MAKE
 IT CLEAR TO THE WHITE HOUSE
 CAN'T FEEL THE SENSE OF BUDDY.
 WHAT'S BEING ARGUED RIGHT NOW --
 AND YOU'VE MENTIONED THE NO
 -SHOW TODAY, IS THAT ELIJAH CUMMINGS -AND IT'S
 TRADITION, BUT IT'S A BAD
 TRADITION -HE WANTS TO GET
 SOMEBODY IN A DEPOSITION WHO IS
 A CURRENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH, LAWYERS FROM
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
 MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN ASSERT WHY
 SOMETHING SHOULDN'T BE ANSWERED.
 IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE LAST
 CONGRESS, DEMOCRATS HAD NO
 PROBLEM INSISTING THAT THE
 PEOPLE FROM AMA
 ADMION ANDERS HAVE
 THAT REPRESENTATION, INCLUDING
 JAMES COMEY WIN AGAIN.
 INCLUDING PETER STRZOK.
 IT'S INTERESTING HOW
 ELIJAH CUMMINGS WANTS IT ONE WAY
 WHEN HE WANTS A WITNESS NOT TO
 HAVE COUNSEL, AND THE OTHER WAY
 BOTTOM LINE, DON IS A VERY SMART
 LAWYER.
 HE'S ALREADY TESTIFIED.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OPEN AND
 TRANSPARENT IN THE WAY THOSE TWO
 PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS WERE NOT.
 SO EXPECT THEM TO COME BUT I
 EXPECTED TO INSIST ON HAVING
 PEOPLE BEHIND HIM THAT CAN
 ADVISE HIM AS TO WHEN TO ANSWER
 QUESTION AND WHEN A PRIVILEGE
 MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE.
 Melissa: HOW BIG OF A RISK
 DO YOU THINK IT IS?
 WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE
 QUESTIONERS WOULD BE GOING
 AFTER.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO PURSUE
 OBSTRUCTION.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO SET UP THE
 POSSIBILITY, THE GROUNDS, FOR
 IMPEACHMENT.
 DON MCGAHN HAS ALREADY BEEN
 THROUGH 30 HOURS OF QUESTIONING
 IN FRONT OF ME WOULD.
 HE HAS ANSWERED THE WAY HE HAS
 ANSWERED.
 IS THERE MUCH RISK AT HIM GOING,
 OR COULD HE JUST COME OUT AND
 OSTENSIBLY REPEAT BASICALLY WHAT
 HE SAID BEFORE?
 YOU SAID IT VERY WELL.
 ■■■■■■■ HE WAS
 THOUGHTFUL AND WHAT HE SAID AND
 HOW HE SAID IT.
 HE WILL REPEAT WHAT HE SAID.
 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF EVERYTHING
 HAVING BEEN SAID BUT NOT
 EVERYBODY HAS SAID IT.
 IN THE CASE OF JERRY NADLER AND
 ELIJAH CUMMINGS, THE TWO
 CHAIRMAN, THEY WANT TO HAVE A
 POLITICAL SHOW.
 THEY WANT TO HAVE THAT LIVE
 THEATER.
 THAT MAY BE POLITICALLY FINE BUT
 IT WON'T CHANGE A LEGAL DECISION
 THAT WAS NOT JUST MADE BY
 MUELLER BUT CODIFIED BY THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
 Melissa: BUT THAT'S THE
 LEGAL DECISION.
 WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO
 SET THE TABLE FOR IMPEACHMENT.
  EXACTLY.
 Melissa: SO HE DOES COME,
 HE SITS DOWN, AND HE SAYS WAS
 EXPECTED AND DOESN'T GO FURTHER.
 THEN HE JUST REITERATES THE
 POINTS THAT WERE MADE BY MUELLER
 AND THOSE TEN POINTS OF POSSIBLE
 OBSTRUCTION.
 IS THAT ENOUGH IN AND OF ITSELF?
 FOR THEM THE HOUSE TO GO AHEAD
 AND MOVE FORWARD ON IMPEACHMENT?
 IN THE CASE OF MANY PEOPLE IN
 THE HOUSE, AFC, JERRY NADLER,
 AND A FEW OTHERS WHO HAVE MADE
 STATEMENTS THAT CAN BE REPEATED
 ON THE AIR, THIS POLITICAL
 DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE.
 THEY ARE READY TO IMPEACH THE
 PRESIDENT.
 IT'S A POLITICAL STATEMENT.
 BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE
 BETWEEN A POLITICAL STATEMENT IN
 A LEGAL STATEMENT.
 THE FORMER PRESIDENT,
 BILL CLINTON, LOST HIS BAR
 LICENSE FOR PERJURY.
 FOR LYING UNDER OATH.
 THAT DID NOT CHANGE THE FACT
 THAT AT THE END OF THE DATE THE
 POLITICAL DECISION WAS NOT TO
 REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE.
 THEY COULD HAVE THIS DISCUSSION
 IN A PURELY POLITICAL FASHION
 BUT THE LEGAL DECISION THAT HE
 DID NOTHING LEGALLY WRONG HAS
 BEEN MADE.
 I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT
 THING.
 THIS IS PURELY POLITICAL NOW.
 THE BIG QUESTION IS, WILL THE
 NEW MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE
 VIOLATE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO HAVE
 COUNSEL?
 Melissa: CONGRESSMAN,
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
 A MAJOR SUPREME COURT CASE AS
 JUSTICES WEIGHED THE TRUMP
 ADMISSIONS PLAN TO ADD A
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE 2020
 CENSUS.
 THE FIRE FROM REACHING
 IMPLICATIONS THIS COULD HAVE ON
 IMMIGRATION AND MORE.
 WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE FORMER
 CHIEF OF CITIZENSHIP.
 THAT'S NEXT.

           Ok everyone!

  Shaving has been difficult for  me.
 I have very sensitive skin, and I get ingrowing hairs.
     So it's a daunting task.
    Oh I love it. It's a great    razor.
    It has that 'fence' in the    middle.
  It gives a nice smooth shave.
 Just stopping that irritation...
  That burn that I get is really  life changing.

 ç■ç■?■ç■?■ç■?■?■ç■?■ç■?■ç■ç■?■çL
 ARGUMENT SINCEn MORNING HAS
 TAKEN O SIGNIFICANCE.
 IT CENTERS AROUND ONE SIMPLE
 LITTLE QUESTION THAT THE TRUMPET
 MENSURATION WANTS TO INCLUDE IN
 THE 2020 CENSUS, AND THAT
 ON IS, "IS THIS PERSON A
 CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES?"
 IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S AN UNUSUAL
 QUESTION.
 IT HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE
 CENSUS FOR WELL OVER A CENTURY.
 ALMOST TWO CENTURIES, FROM 1820
 TO 1950.
 THE TRUMPET WANTS TO INCLUDE IT
 AGAIN BECA BELIEVES IT'S
 WHILE THEYç■ç■■ç■ç■ç■ç■ç■ç■ç■ç■S FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS,
 THEY REJECT THE LAW THAT HAS
 PRINTED ON THE CENSUS WEBSITE
 WOULD SAYS, AND I QUOTE, "IT'S
 ILLEGAL FOR THE CENSUS BUREAU
 TO PUBLISH ANY PRIVATE
 INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES ANY
 INDIVIDUALS OR BUSINESSES."
 WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A
 CONSPIRACY THEORIST TO BE
 CONCERNED THAT IF THAT DATA IS
 OUT THERE, HE COULD POSE A RISK
 TO YOU.
 WE'VE SEEN ADMINISTRATIONS THAT
 IS STICKING PEOPLE UP IN
 SENSITIVE PLACES LIKE
 COURTHOUSES, SCHOOLS, GOING TO
 THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.
 EVEN UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
 ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AS MANY AS
 6.5 MILLION PEOPLE MIGHT NOT
 PARTICIPATE IN THE 2020 CENSUS
 IF THAT QUESTION WERE TO BE
 INCLUDED.
 BY THE WAY, IT IS ILLEGAL NOT TO
 FILL OUT A CENSUS.
 CENSUS, I SHOULD SAY.
 IT'S PUNISHABLE BY A $150 FINE.
 THE RAMIFICATIONS OF ANOTHER
 ACCOUNT ARE HUGE.
 THE CENSUS DETERMINES FOR THE
 NEXT TEN YEARS HOW MANY
 ELECTORAL VOTES THE STATE HAS.
 HOW MANY REPRESENTATIVES THE
 STATE HAS, AND NO FEDERAL
 RESOURCES ARE DIVVIED OUT TO THE
 STATES.
 PARTISAN LINES DEVELOP QUICKLY
 HERE IN ORAL ARGUMENTS BEFORE
 LEFT-LEANING JUSTICES PRESS THE
 LAWYER FOR THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT TO EXPLAIN THE
 REASONING BEHIND THE CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION.
 THEY CITED THE POTENTIAL FOR A
 6.5 MILLION PERSON UNDERCOUNT.
 CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ASKED
 WHETHER THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION
 ALONE WOULD CAUSE INACCURATE
 CENSUS.
 CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS
 NOTING THAT A RANGE OF QUESTIONS
 IS ASKED IN THE CENSUS ANYWAY,
 INCLUDING A PERSON'S AGE AND SE
 SEX.
 THEY WILL HAVE TO RULE BEFORE
 THE END OF DO NOT ONLY TO AT
 TRADITIONAL DEADLINE BUT TO MEET
 THE DEADLINE OF THE PRINTING
 OFFICE PAID THEREAFTER BE
 PRINTED OUT BY THAT DATE IN
 ORDER TO MEET THE CENSUS, WHICH
 GETS UNDERWAY INKK■■G■ OF 2020.
 BACK TO YOU, MELISSA.
 Melissa: DOUG, THANK YOU
 FOR THAT.
 FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IT UP ONCE
 I GET THERE.
 HE IS FORMER CHIEF OF THE U.S.
 OFFICE OF CITIZENSHIP UNDER
 PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH.
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 LET ME ASK A BASIC QUESTION TO
 START.
 DO YOU THINK YOU GET A MORE
 ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT IS
 GOING ON AND WHO IS HERE
 EXACTLY, AND WITH THE
 DEMOGRAPHICS ARE WITH THE
 QUESTION THERE?
 OR WITHOUT IT?
 IT'S HARD TO SAY.
 INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WASN'T A
 GOOD IDEA TO INCLUDE THE
 QUESTION.
 BASED ON WHAT EXPERTS ARE SAYING
 THAT IT COULD DISSUADE
 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM
 PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS.
 BUT WHEN I LOOK AND DELVE INTO
 THE ISSUE, LOOK AT THE DATA,
 IT'S BASED ON FOCUS GROUPS,■ET T
 REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GENERAL
 POPULATION.
 SO THERE IS NO HARD EVIDENCE TO
 DETERMINE THAT UNDOCUMENTED
 IMMIGRANTS WOULD NOT PARTICIPAT
 PARTICIPATE.
 I THINK THAT IF THE SENSE      S
 ASSETS STAY ON THE FORM, BUT
 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SHARED WITH
 LAW ENFORCEMENT.
 AND THAT IS INFORMED, THERE'S A
 GOOD EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO THE
 PUBLIC ABOUT THAT.
 I DON'T SEE WHY IMMIGRANTS AND
 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WOULD
 NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE.
 I THINK THIS IS JUST ANOTHER
 OPPORTUNITY BY DEMOCRATS TO
 TOTALLY POLITICIZE AN ISSUE AND
 ATTACK DONALD TRUMP.
 THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE'VE
 ASKED -WE HAVE HAD A
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION DURING THE
 OBAMA YEARS IN THE■JñJéééé■ééééA
 TOOL THAT IS DONE -AN
 INSTRUMENT THAT IS DONE EVERY
 SINGLE YEAR -THERE IS A
 QUESTION ABOUT CITIZENSHIP.
 Melissa: WAS THERE LESS
 PARTICIPATION ON THAT ONE?
 YES.
 Melissa: IN ESSENCE, THAT
 IS PROOF THAT FEW PEOPLE WOULD
 RESPOND IF THE Q WAS
 THERE.
 I WONDER IF YOU ARE HERE
 ILLEGALLY IF YOU RESPOND TO THE
 CENSUS AT ALL, WITH THE QUESTION
 IS THERE OR NOT.
 BEING WORRIED THAT YOU ARE JUST
 BEING WATCHED FROM SOMEWHERE AND
 YOU ARE NOT HERE LEGALLY.
 I WANT TO BRING YOU TO SOME
 BREAKING NEWS RIGHT NOW THAT WE
 ARE SEEING.
 THERE IS SOME NEW VIDEO WE HAVE
 IN, SHOWING ARMED SMUGGLERS THAT
 ARE ESCORTING A MIGRANT FAMILY
 OVER THE BORDER IN ARIZONA.
 THIS VIDEO CAME FROM U.S. BORDER
 PATROL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND
 IT IS FROM SATURDAY NIGHT.
 IT'S NEAR THE TOWN OF LUCASVILLE
 IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CORNER OF
 ARIZONA
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT FOR TO FIVE MEN IN TACTICAL GEAR AND MASKS
 CARRYING LONG GUNS AND AK-47
 ASSAULT RIFLES.
 THEY ARE ESCORTING A GOAL
 GUATEMALAN WOMAN AND HER CHILD UNDER A BARRIER.
 THIS VIDEO WAS OSTENSIBLY PUT UP
 BECAUSE BORDER PATROL WANTS
 PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
 SEEING.
 THEY ARE SAYING THIS SHOWS AN
 ESCALATION IN THE WAY THAT
 PEOPLE ARE CROSSING THE BORDER.
 THAT THEY APPREHENDED ALMOST 400
 GUATEMALAN IMMIGRANTS ON SEVERAL
 BUSES JUST A HUNDRED YARDS FROM
 WHERE THIS WAS, RIGHT NEAR THIS
 AREA.
 THEY ALSO ADD THAT DISEASES
 SMUGGLERS IN GENERAL CHARGE
 BASICALLY $7,000, IN THEIR
 EXPERIENCE, TO TRANSPORT
 GUATEMALANS OVER THE BORDER
 HERE.
 SO THEY CAN APPLY FOR ASYLUM.
 WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THISÑ@■
 I THINK THAT, YES, COYOTES,
 SMUGGLERS, THEY ARE ARMING UP.
 IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION THAT
 THERE'S A CRISIS OF THE BORDER,
 I FIGURE THIS VIDEO ILLUSTRATES
 THAT THERE IS A CRISIS.
 THAT SMUGGLERS ARE WILLING TO
 ESCORT THIS INDIVIDUAL TRYING TO
 ENTER IRREGULARLY, ILLEGALLY
 COME INTO THE COUNTRY.
 WITH WEAPONS.
 THIS IS SCARY.
 THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE
 TRYING TO ENTER ILLEGALLY
 THROUGH THE BORDER HAS GONE UP
 DRAMATICALLY.
 Melissa: BUT THIS IS AN
 ESCALATION?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 BUT REMEMBER, DEMOCRATS WERE
 SAYING COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE
 WAS NO CRISIS OF THE BORDER.
 Melissa: ABSOLUTELY.
 THANK YOU FOR GOING WITH US ON
 THE NEWS THAT CAME IN.
 HAVE TO CUT IT SHORT NOW.
 ANY WARNING FROM A TOP OFFICIAL
 IN SRI L FOLLOWING THE
 EASTER BOMBING THAT LEFT MORE
 THAN 300 PEOPLE DEAD, INCLUDING
 SEVERAL AMERICANS.
 WE HAVE A LIVE REPORT NEXT.

    ly,  call NewDay USA.
        A NewDay VA home     loan lets you refinance
     your home and take out          54,000 dollars
 or more to pay credit card debt,
  or just put money in the bank.
  It even lowers your payments
       by over 600 dollars             a month.
      As a veteran, you've       earned the powerful
      VA home loan benefit          that lets you
   refinance up to 100 percent      of your home's value.
   And with home values rising,
    that can mean a lot more  money for you and your family.
     And because NewDay USA         has been granted
  Automatic Authority by the VA,
        they can say yes        when banks say no.
     And they'll do all the      VA paperwork for you.
 We all know some of life's most
       important financial          decisions are
       made right here at        the kitchen table.
     So, if you're a veteran          and need cash,

 TALK ABOUT THE CRISIS OF THE
 BOARD OF TRADE ONLY ON
 "THE DAILY BRIEFING" ."
 I BELIEVE WE NEED TO GET OUT
 OF THIS PRESIDENT.
 THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING TO BECOME
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE VERY GOOD
 REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS
 AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN
 CONDUCTED, WHICH HAS PRODUCED
 EVIDENCE THAT TELLS US THIS
 PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
 ENGAGED IN OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE
 THE STEPS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT.
 Melissa: KAMALA HARRIS
 <u>DEMOCRATS ADVOCATING FOR</u> IMPEACHMENT.
 THIS, DESPITE SPEAKER PELOSI'S
 ATTEMPT KDOWN THAT TALK
 IN A CONFERENCE CALL WITH HER
 CAUCUS YESTERDAY.
 LET'S BRING IN OUR POWER PANEL,
 DAN HENNINGER, DEPUTY EDITOR FOR
 "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"
 EDITORh■pú■
 PRIZE-WINNING AUTH
 I THINK ESTABLISHING
 HERSELF ALONG WITH
 ELIZABETH WARREN IN TERMS OF THE
 CANDIDATES THAT MOST WANT TO
 HOLD THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE.
 THAT MAY VERY WELL BE GOOD
 POLITICS FOR THEM.
 I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOOD POLITICS
 FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 IN FACT, IT'S PROBABLY
 COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF IT GOES
 FORWARD.
 RIGHT NOW I THINK NANCY PELOSI
 HAS IT RIGHT.
 LET THESE HEARINGS PLAY OUT, AND
 LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BE
 EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 LET'S FACE IT, MOST PEOPLE ARE
 NOT GOING TO BE 440 PAGES.
 AND NOW ONLY 6 OUT OF 10
 DEMOCRATS WANT TO MOVE FORWARD
 WITH IMPEACHMENT.
 YOU HAVE AN EDUCATION PROCESS
 THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE --
 Melissa: SO THEY CAN
 UNDERSTAND THEY SHOULD IMPEACH
 HIM?
 IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
 UNDERSTAND OF THE THINGS HE
 WAS ACCUSED OF AND PART 22 OF
 THE MUELLER REPORT -THERE
 WAS --
 Melissa: YOU THINK THEY
 QUALIFY FOR IMPEACHMENT?
 I THINK THAT'S A THE PARTY
 WILL HAVE TO MAKE BUT IT'S
 CERTAINLY VERY SERIOUS, AND I
 THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT, BY
 THE WAY, MUELLER THROUGH TO THE
 CONGRESS.
 JUDY, LET ME SAY, WITH
 RESPECT -THE QUICKNESS WITH
 WHICH THIS STORY HAS PIVOTED
 FROM THE RUSSIAN COLLUSION
 NARRATIVE OF TWO YEARS ABOUT
 WHICH THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT COME MUCH NOW WE
 ARE ON THE IMPEACH TRUMPS
 NARRATIVE OVER THE OBSTRUCTION
 ISSUE.
 THE COLLISION NARRATIVE HAS
 EVAPORATED LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE
 AND THE OBSTRUCTION IS FOR
 OBSTRUCTING ACTS THAT NEVER
 OCCURRED.
 TRUMPET KNEW AT THE TIME THAT HE
 HAD DONE NOTHING, RIGHT? BY DEFINITION.
 SINCE MUELLER CONCLUDED THERE IS
 NOTHING TO THE COLLUSION
 ACCUSATIONS.
 THAT WE ARE IN THIS KIND OF
 CONVERSATION ABOUT IMPEACHING
 TRUMP FOR BAD BEHAVIOR INSIDE
 THE WAREHOUSE.
 Melissa: HE WAS BEING
 FALSELY ACCUSED.
 WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
 LOOK AT, IF YOU ARE
 INSTRUCTING YOUR PEOPLE TO
 SELECT THE CONGRESS AND
 INSTRUCTING THEM TO LIE TO THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT IS VERY
 SERIOUS.
 TRYING TO A SYSTEM OF JUSTICE BY
 GETTING PEOPLE FIRED IN YOUR
 ADMINISTRATION, BAD FOR THE
 COUNTRY.
 WHY THE HEARINGS?
 GO STRAIGHT TO IMPEACHMENT.
 Melissa: THEN WHY IS HE
 TRYING TO OR PREVENT JUSTICE IF
 HE DIDN'T DO IT?
 YOU SEE HOW IT KIND OF
 UNDERMINES THE OBSTRUCTION
 ARGUMENT?
 IS NOT TRYING TO GET THEM TO
 NOT ADMIT WHAT THEY HAD DONE,
 BECAUSE THEY HADN'T DONE
 THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN SAYING,
 "GO OUT THERE AND TELL MY
 STORY."
 THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM SAYING,
 "GO OUT THERE AND LIED TO THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 I WANT TO FIRE MUELLER.
 THE ONLY REASON REALLY WASN'T
 FIRED IS THAT DON BEGIN WITH DO
 IT.
 I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO
 KNOW THAT AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE
 THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT
 WHETHER OR NOT THAT RISES TO THE
 LEVEL OF -      DEL MIKE --
 Melissa: WENT TO HAVE
 WANTED TO FIRE MUELLER BECAUSE
 HE KNEW HE WAS PURSUING
 SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?
 THAT'S HOW I DEAL WITH THE
 RUSSIAN COLLISION WASN'T REAL,
 SO HE WAS LIKE, "WHY ARE WE
 DOING THIS?"
 CERTAINLY THE REASON HE WAS
 DOING THESE THINGS IS BECAUSE
 HE'S DONALD TRUMP.
 HE KNEW HE HADN'T■ENYTHING
 AND NOW HE'S REACHING AROUND AND
 STRIKING OUT AT PEOPLE.
 Melissa: WE'VE GOT TO GO.
 MORE "OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME" IN
