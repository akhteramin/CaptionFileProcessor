 SPECIAL NIGHT AT ST. ANSELM COLLEGE IN MANCHESTER, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE.
 I'M ANDERSON COOPER.
 WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED WITH
 OUR CNN PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL
 EVENT.
 IN THE LAST HOUR YOU HEARD FROM
 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR.
 LATER TONIGHT YOU'LL SEE CORY
 SANDERS, KAMALA HARRIS AND PETE
 BUTTIGIEG.
 TO PULL THIS EVENT OFF CNN HAS
 PARTNERED WITH HARVARD
 UNIVERSITY'S COLLEGE OF
 POLITICS.
 ALSO WITH THE NEW HAMPSHIRE
 INSTITUTE OF POLITICS RIGHT HERE
 AT ST. ANSELM COLLEGE.
 THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE
 CANDIDATES WILL TAKE QUESTIONS
 FROM THESE YOUNG COLLEGE
 STUDENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO
 ARE IN THE AUDITORIUM WHO SAY
 THEY PLAN TO VOTE IN THEIR
 STATE'S DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES AND
 CAUCUSES.
 WELCOME TO THE STAGE PLEASE,
 SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.
 HI.
 IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 HI.
 HAVE A SEAT?
 ARE WE GOING TO DO STUDENTS?
 LET'S GO RIGHT TO IT.
 IN THAT CASE, I WANT CLOSER.
 HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE ONES
 IN THE BACK.
 I WANT TO START WITH YOUR BIG
 ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY ABOUT COLLEGE
 AFFORDABILITY.
 IT COULD IMPACT A LOT OF
 STUDENTS HERE.
 I WANT TO BRING IN DENA MILLER
 FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
 SHY'S A JUNIOR STUDYING HISTORY.
 DENA.
 HI, SENATOR.
 I LIKE SO MANY OTHER STUDENTS
 HAD TO TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR
 MY EDUCATION THAT I WILL BE
 PAYING FOR YEARS.
 WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR STUDENT
 DEBT?
 THANKS FOR THE QUESTION,
 DENA.
 THIS IS THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN
 NOW.
 BASICALLY TO GET A SHOT AT A
 MIDDLE CLASS LIFE YOU'VE GOT TO
 HAVE SOME POST HIGH SCHOOL
 TECHNICAL TRAINING, TWO-YEAR
 COLLEGE, FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE,
 MAYBE GRADUATE SCHOOL DEPENDING
 ON WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE
 ENDING UP DOING.
 THE POSITION OF THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN, GOOD LUCK
 TO YOU, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
 THE ONE THING THEY'VE DONE,
 THETHEY
 H
 HAVE' DONE IS LENT TENS OF
 THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO
 STUDENTS.
 IT IS CRUSHING THEM.
  MY PROPOSAL IS TO SAY, THIS
 ISN'T RIGHT.
 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AS A COUNTRY
 IS ROLL BACK THAT DEBT.
 SO I HAVE TWO PARTS TO THE
 PROPOSAL.
 PART ONE IS THAT WE SAY THAT
 WE'RE GOING TO ROLL BACK STUDENT
 LOAN DEBT FOR ABOUT 95% OF
 STUDENTS WHO HAVE DEBT.
 THAT'S PART ONE.
 AND PART TWO IS TO MAKE SURE
 THAT WE NEVER GET IN THIS MESS
 AGAIN ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND
 THAT IS TO MAKE COLLEGE
 UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE WITH FREE
 TUITION AND FEES AND TO PUT MORE
 MONEY INTO PELL GRANTS SO THAT
 STUDENTS OF COLOR, SO THAT OUR
 POOREST STUDENTS HAVE REAL
 ACCESS TO COLLEGE AND THAT WE
 PUT REAL MONEY INTO OUR
 UNIVERSITIES.BLACK COLLEGES AND
 THIS IS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR
 EVERYONE.
 AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAY
 FOR IT?
 I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK FOR
 IT.
 THAT IS THE CRITICISM FOR
 REPUBLICANS, HOW TO PAY FOR IT.
 CENTRIST DEMOCRATS SAY DOESN'T
 THIS FEED THE NARRATIVE THAT
 DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE
 EVERYTHING AWAY FOR FREE.
 LET'S REMEMBER WHERE THIS ALL
 STARTED.
 I STARTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO
 ABOUT A WEALTH TAX.
 IT'S 2 CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR
 ABOVE THE GREAT FORTUNES ABOVE
 50 MILLION DOLLARS.
 SO YOUR 50 MILLIONTH AND FIRST
 DOLLAR YOU HAVE TO PAY TWO CENTS
 ON ALL OF THE DOLLARS AFTER
 THAT.
 HERE'S THE STUNNING PART.
 IF WE ASK THE GREAT FORTUNES IN
 THIS COUNTRY, UNDERSTAND, THIS
 ISN'T ABOUT TRYING TO BE NASTY
 OR SAY YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING
 WRONG, WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS
 SAYING, LOOK, YOU HAD A GREAT
 IDEA.
 YOU GOT OUT THERE.
 YOU WORKED HARD OR YOU INHERITED
 WELL.
 WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT THAT
 GREAT FORTUNE, SPEND JUST A
 MINUTE TO REMEMBER HOW YOU GOT
 IT.
 YOU BUILT THAT GREAT BUSINESS OR
 YOUR ANCESTORS DID USING WORKERS
 THAT ALL OF US HELPED PAY TO
 EDUCATE.
 YOU GOT YOUR GOODS TO MARKET
 USING ROADS AND BRIDGES THAT ALL
 OF US HELPED PAY TO BUILD.
 YOU ARE PROTECTED IN YOUR
 FACTORIES WITH FIREFIGHTERS AND
 POLICE OFFICERS THAT ALL OF US
 HELPED TO PAY.
 AND WE SAY, GOOD FOR YOU, THAT
 YOU HAVE NOW GOTTEN THIS GREAT
 FORTUNE, BUT TWO CENTS.
 YOU'VE GOT TO PAY SOMETHING BACK
 SO EVERYBODY ELSE GETS A CHANCE.
 AND HERE'S HOW THE MONEY WORKS
 OUT.
 IF WE PUT THAT TWO CENT WEALTH
 TAX IN PLACE ON THE 75,000
 LARGEST FORTUNES IN THIS
 COUNTRY, TWO CENTS, WE CAN DO
 UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE FOR EVERY
 BABY ZERO TO 5, UNIVERSAL PRE-K,
 UNIVERSAL COLLEGE AND KNOCK BACK
 THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN FOR
 95% OF OUR STUDENTS AND STILL
 HAVE NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS
 LEFT OVER.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 YEAH.
 I WANT YOU TO -THI1&■■ ■ ■M
 MICK FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
 HI, MEGHAN.
 SHE'S A GRADUATE STUDENT AT
 HARVARD AND M.I.T.
 SHE'S A CONTRIBUTOR AT FORBES.
 YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A SCHLUB.
 I MEAN --
 WHAT DO YOU DO IN YOUR SPARE
 TIME, MEGHAN?
 IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 SO AMAZON'S MONOPOLY MEANS I CAN
 BUY GENERIC GOODS AND BRANDS
 FROM MY PHONE AND RECEIVE THEM
 ON MY DOORSTEP WITHOUT A
 DELIVERY FEE WITHIN 24 HOURS.
 HOW IS BREAKING UP BIG TECH GOOD
 FOR ME?
 OKAY.
 GOOD QUESTION, MEGHAN.
 HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO REMEMBER
 ABOUT AMAZON, ABOUT GOOGLE,
 ABOUT APPLE, ABOUT A LOT OF
 THESE GIANT TECH COMPANIES.
 THEY ACTUALLY RUN TWO
 BUSINESSES.
 SO ONE IS THE PLATFORM.
 THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE
 COME TO BUY AND SELL GOODS.
 THAT'S WHERE YOU GO TO GET
 WHATEVER IT IS, YOU KNOW, YOU
 CAN COMPARE 48 PRINTERS AND GET
 IT ALL DELIVERED IN LESS THAN 24
 HOURS.
 GOT IT.
 COOL.
 THAT'S THE PLATFORM.
 JUST SO YOU GET AN IDEA OF THE
 SCALE HERE FOR AMAZON, WALMART
 DOES ABOUT 9% OF ALL RETAIL
 SALES IN AMERICA.
 IF YOU WANT TO SELL ONLINE,
 AMAZON IS DOING ABOUT 49% OF ALL
 RETAIL SALES THAT ARE HAPPENING
 IN AMERICA.
 SO THAT IS THE MARKETPLACE.
 SO AMAZON RUNS THE MARKETPLACE.
 I'M COOL WITH THAT.
 I'M ALL FOR A MARKETPLACE, BUT
 AMAZON DOES A SECOND THING AND
 THAT IS THEY COLLECT INFORMATION
 ON EVERY BUYER AND SELLER WHO
 COMES THROUGH.
 EVERY TIME YOU GO TO BUY
 SOMETHING, THEY GET YOUR
 INFORMATION AND THEY AGGREGATE
 IT WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION
 THEY HAD ABOUT YOU.
 EVERY TIME YOU COME TO SELL
 SOMETHING THEY GET INFORMATION.
 AND THEN THEY SEE THAT, WHOA,
 OVER THERE IT LOOKS LIKE PET
 PILLOWS IS STARTING TO MAKE A
 BIG PROFIT.
 HUH, SAYS AMAZON.
 I KNOW WHAT WE'LL DO.
 LET'S JUMP IN FRONT OF PET
 PILLOWS AND DO AMAZON PET
 PILLOWS AND MOVE PET PILLOWS
 FROM THE FRONT PAGE BACK TO PAGE
 16 AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT
 AMAZON, BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIOR
 INFORMATION, CAN COME IN AND
 KNOCK OUT ALL OF THE
 COMPETITION.
 NOW THIS IS A REAL THING,
 MEGHAN, THAT'S HAPPENING.
 HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW AS A
 CONSEQUENCE OF THIS, IS THAT THE
 AREA AROUND THESE GIANTS ARE
 REFERRED TO BY VENTURE
 CAPITALISTS, INVESTORS, AS THE
 DEAD ZONE BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU
 TRY TO START UP A BUSINESS, YOU
 JUST RUN THE RISK THAT AMAZON
 STEPS IN FRONT OF YOU OR GOOGLE
 STEPS IN FRONT OF YOU OR THEY
 BUY YOU OUT BEFORE YOU HAVE A
 CHANCE TO GET STARTED.
 LOOK, HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.
 YOU CAN RUN THE PLATFORM, THAT
 IS, YOU CAN BE THE UMPIRE IN THE
 BASEBALL GAME AND YOU CAN RUN AN
 HONEST PLATFORM, OR YOU CAN BE A
 PLAYER, THAT IS, YOU CAN HAVE A
 BUSINESS OR YOU CAN HAVE A TEAM
 IN THE GAME, BUT YOU DON'T GET
 TO BE THE UMPIRE AND HAVE A TEAM
 IN THE GAME.
 IF WE BREAK OFF THE PLATFORM
 FROM THE PARTS THAT ARE
 COMPETING, WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN
 AMERICA IS A PLATFORM THAT WORKS
 REALLY WELL.
 IT'S A VERY PROFITABLE BUSINESS
 BUT YOU'LL SEE A LOT MORE
 COMPETITION WHERE LITTLE
 BUSINESSES HAVE A CHANCE TO GET
 GOING WHERE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A
 GOOD IDEA YOU CAN BUILD THAT
 GOOD IDEA INTO SOMETHING, WHERE
 THERE'S REALLY A CHANCE FOR
 EVERYBODY TO GET IN AND COMPETE.
 SO THAT'S THE REASON I WANT TO
 SEE THE TWO OF THEM BROKEN
 APART.
 DO YOU ORDER STUFF FROM
 AMAZON?
 SURE.
 YOU DO?
 WHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU
 ORDERED, DO YOU KNOW?
 A MAILBOX.
 OKAY.
 WHAT DID THEY PUT THE MAILBOX IN
 WHEN THEY DELIVER IT?
 IT COMES IN A BOX.
 IT WAS A BOX OF MAILBOX.
 WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION NOW.
 OKAY.
 THIS IS SETH PHILO FROM
 ARIZONA.
 HE'S A SUPPORTER OF BUTTIGIEG.
 IN 2012 YOU OPPOSED THE SALE
 OF MARIJUANA YET IN 2016 YOU
 CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE
 LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA
 NATIONWIDE.
 WHAT ARE YOUR HONEST VIEWS ON
 THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA
 AND MARIJUANA LEGISLATION AND IF
 THEY HAVE, WHY HAVE THEY
 CHANGED?
 SO, ACTUALLY, I SUPPORTED
 MASSACHUSETTS CHANGING ITS LAWS
 ON MARIJUANA.
 MASSACHUSETTS HAD DECRIMINALIZED
 AT THAT POINT AND I THOUGHT IT
 MADE A LOT MORE SENSE FOR
 MASSACHUSETTS TO GO AHEAD AND
 LEGALIZE MARIJUANA, AND I NOW
 SUPPORT THE LEGALIZATION OF
 MARIJUANA.
 AND LET ME TELL YOU AT LEAST A
 COUPLE OF REASONS WHY.
 THE FIRST ONE IS, IT'S JUST A
 PLAIN OLD SCIENCE REASON.
 IT MAKES NO DARN SENSE THAT
 RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE TREAT
 MARIJUANA AS A SCHEDULE 1 DRUG,
 WHICH MEANS IN EFFECT THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS
 DETERMINED IN ADVANCE THAT IT
 HAS NO MEDICINAL USE, THAT IT
 CAN'T HAVE ANY GOOD EFFECTS, NO
 RESEARCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.
 IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DO
 RESEARCH ON IT AND THAT'S
 JUST -WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS,
 RIGHT?
 WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO IT.
 BUT THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE
 OF THE RACIAL IMPACT OF THE
 ENFORCEMENT OF MARIJUANA LAWS.
 YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW IN THIS
 COUNTRY THE BEST EVIDENCE
 SUGGESTS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS
 AND WHITES USE MARIJUANA AT
 ABOUT THE SAME RATES AND YET
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE
 LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR
 MARIJUANA USE THAN WHITES ARE.
 SO EVERY TIME WE START TO TALK
 ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM,
 FOR EXAMPLE, I THINK A GOOD
 PLACE TO START IS WITH THE
 THINGS WE MAKE ILLEGAL, AND ONE
 OF THE BEST PLACES WE COULD
 START IS BY LEGALIZING
 MARIJUANA.
 I WANT YOU TO MEET JACKSON
 DWYER, HE'S FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
 HE'S A SENIOR AT ST. ANSELM
 COLLEGE.
 HI, JACKSON.
 HI, SENATOR.
 YOU HAVE OFTEN BEEN A VOCAL
 CRITIC OF STATE POLICERS.
 HOW CAN YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU
 WILL SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT
 KEEPS LAW ENFORCEMENT SAFE?
 SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD
 QUESTION.
 I APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING IT.
 YOU KNOW, I TALK WITH A LOT OF
 PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, PEOPLE
 WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT, PEOPLE
 WHO ARE IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM,
 PEOPLE WHO ARE IN -PEOPLE WHO
 ARE INCARCERATED, VARIOUS PARTS
 OF IT, AND WHAT ALL OF THEM TELL
 ME IS WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
 OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS
 BROKEN, AND RIGHT AT THE HEART
 OF THAT PROBLEM IS RACE.
 AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS HEAD
 ON.
 SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU SOME
 BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S
 HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN OUR
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
 STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY
 SHOWS US THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS
 COMPARED WITH WHITES ARE MORE
 LIKELY TO BE FOR EXACTLY THE
 SAME CRIMES, THEY'RE MORE LIKELY
 TO BE ARRESTED, THEY'RE MORE
 LIKELY TO BE ARRAIGNED, THEY ARE
 MORE LIKELY TO BE TAKEN TO
 TRIAL.
 THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE
 WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND THEY
 ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE
 HARSHER SENTENCES.
 THIS IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ONLY LOCKING
 UP TOO MANY PEOPLE, IT IS A
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT HAS
 A PROBLEM OF RACE RIGHT AT THE
 HEART OF IT, AND WE NEED TO CALL
 IT OUT FOR WHAT IT IS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 NO ONE IS SAFER IN A WORLD
 WHERE WE HAVE A BROKEN CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE SYSTEM, SO LET ME JUST
 GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF THE PARTS
 DIRECTLY TO YOUR QUESTION.
 I SAID ON THE FIRST PART ONE WAY
 WE CAN HELP FIX THIS SYSTEM IS
 TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IT IS WE
 MAKE IT ILLEGAL.
 HOW ABOUT THE NEXT PART IN THE
 JUDICIAL SYSTEM?
 WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
 EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED AND GETS
 GOOD LEGAL REPRESENTATION.
 THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WE WANT TO
 MAKE SURE THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE
 INCARCERATED AND NOT THE WRONG
 PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T
 AFFORD TO HIRE A LAWYER.
 JUSTICE IS NOT JUST FOR THOSE
 WHO ARE RICH, JUSTICE IS FOR
 EVERYONE AND THE ONLY WAY WE'RE
 ABLE TO GET THAT IN AMERICA IS
 IF WE'RE ABLE TO PUT THE
 RESOURCES INTO IT.
 THIRD PART OFHIS I■ROFIT PRIVAT
 PRISONS.
 IT IS AN OUTRAGE IN AMERICA.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 SFFOURTH IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE
 LEAVE THE PRISON SYSTEM, THEY
 NEED TO BE REINTEGRATED.
 THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND A
 JOB, FIND DECENT HOUSING,, AND
 THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO
 PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL
 PROCESS.
 AND THAT MEANS THEY NEED THE
 RIGHT TO VOTE TO BE REINSTATED.
 THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS.
 ONE MORE, YOU TALK ABOUT SAFETY
 FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND YOU
 ARE RIGHT.
 THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.
 ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS THAT WE
 COULD HELP MAKE OUR POLICE SAFER
 IS TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT GUN
 SAFETY IN THIS COUNTRY.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

 YOU MENTIONED SARGEANT GANNON'S
 TRAGIC DEATH IN MASSACHUSETTS.
 I WROTE AN OP ED WITH HIS
 PARENTS ABOUT ASKING FOR OUR
 LEADERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TO
 STEP UP AND PASS SOME SENSIBLE
 GUN SAFETY LAWS.
 WE NEED UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND
 CHECKS, WE NEED TO TAKE WEAPONS
 OF WAR OFF OUR CITY STREETS.
 RIGHT NOW WE LIVE IN AMERICA
 WHERE 7 CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS
 WILL DIE EVERY SINGLE DAY, WHERE
 THE LIVES OF OFFICERS ARE PUT AT
 RISK.
 WE NEED AS A COUNTRY TO STEP UP,
 TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE, TO BE
 WILLING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE
 NRA AND TO PUT SOME SENSIBLE GUN
 SAFETY LAWS IN PLACE.
 I THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST
 THAT WE CAN DO.
 THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THIS IS ELLIE TAYLOR.
 SHE'S FROM WISCONSIN.
 SHE'S A STUDENT AT HARVARD AND A
 FRESHMAN.
 HI, ELLIE.
 HI, SENATOR.
 THIS ISN'T AS MUCH OF A
 POLICY-BASED QUESTION.
 SOME PEOPLE HAVE VOICED YOU
 GETTING HILLARIED IN THE
 ELECTION SO WHAT LESSONS HAVE
 YOU LEARNED FROM 2016 THAT WILL
 HELP YOU TO KIND OF NAVIGATE
 THESE SITUATIONS WHEN YOU MIGHT
 BE CRITICIZED FOR SOMETHING
 THAT'S PARTIALLY MOTIVATED BY
 SEXIST.
 THAT'S A REALLY GOOD
 QUESTION, BUT IF I CAN, I WANT
 TO GO BACK BEFORE 2016.
 CAN WE ALL JUST LET OUR HAIR
 DOWN HERE FOR A MINUTE?
 THIS DIDN'T JUST START IN 2016.
 BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.
 I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I RAN INTO IT
 BIG TIME.
 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO
 BE IN ELECTED POLITICS.
 I'VE KNOWN WHAT I WANTED TO DO
 ALL MY LIFE.
 I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER.
 I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE MY JOB
 FOREVER.
 DURING THE CRASH I END UP DOWN
 IN WASHINGTON SETTING UP A
 CONSUMER AGENCY FOR PRESIDENT
 OBAMA.
 AFTER I DID THAT FOR A YEAR, THE
 REPUBLICANS SAID, WE'RE NEVER
 GOING TO LET HER STAY AND RUN
 THAT THING.
 I CAME BACK TO MASSACHUSETTS.
 THERE WAS A VERY POPULAR
 REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT.
 HE HAD HIGH APPROVAL RATINGS, HE
 HAD A BUCKET OF MONEY IN THE
 BANK FROM WALL STREET AND HE HAD
 JUST BEATEN A WOMAN WHO WAS
 REALLY GOOD AND EVERYBODY
 THOUGHT WAS GOING TO WIN.
 SO I START GETTING THESE PHONE
 CALLS FROM PEOPLE AND THEY SAY,
 ELIZABETH, YOU SHOULD RUN
 AGAINST HIM FOR THE SENATE SEAT.
 YOU SHOULD DO IT.
 GO AHEAD.
 YOU SHOULD DO THIS THING.
 YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE, BUT YOU
 SHOULD DEFINITELY DO -THESE
 WERE DEMOCRATS CALLING ME.
 SAYING, YOU SHOULD DO THIS.
 YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE.
 ALL I CAN SAY IS DEMOCRATS, GET
 A BETTER MESSAGE.
 BUT PEOPLE SAID TO ME, YOU'RE
 GOING TO LOSE BECAUSE
 MASSACHUSETTS IN 2011, ACCORDING
 TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, WAS NOT
 READY TO HAVE A WOMAN SENATOR OR
 GOVERNOR.
 WE NEVER HAD AND PEOPLE SAID
 IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, ■
 GENERATION.
 NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW I HEARD
 THAT.
 I HEARD THAT AS, GET IN THIS
 RACE, RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS WHAT I
 DID.
 SO I JUMPED IN THE RACE AND SURE
 ENOUGH, YOU KNOW, THE EARLY
 COVERAGE IS ABOUT WHAT I'M
 WEARING.
 IT'S ABOUT MY HAIR.
 IT'S ABOUT MY VOICE.
 IT'S ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I
 SMILE ENOUGH.
 I DIDN'T.
 IT WAS EVERY PART OF THAT.
 THIS KEPT UP AND I THOUGHT, YOU
 KNOW, LOOK, I'M GOING TO BE IN
 THIS RACE.
 I'M GOING TO MAKE SOMETHING
 COUNT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
 SO EVERY DAY WHEN I SAW A LITTLE
 GIRL, I WOULD COME UP AND I'D
 USUALLY GET DOWN, I'M A TEACHER,
 AND I WOULD SAY, HI, MY NAME IS
 ELIZABETH AND I'M RUNNING FOR
 SENATE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GIRLS
 DO.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 AND THEN WE WOULD PINKY SWEAR
 TO REMEMBER, AND SO EVERY NIGHT
 WHEN I WENT HOME, NO MATTER WHAT
 THE DAY HAD BEEN LIKE, I WOULD
 COUNT UP HOW MANY PINKY SWEARS
 WE HAD DONE DURING THE DAY.
 AND I KEPT GETTING OUT THERE AND
 HAMMERING MY MESSAGE.
 I KEPT GETTING OUT THERE TALKING
 ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH
 WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE
 COUNTRY, TALKING ABOUT HOW
 WASHINGTON WORKS GREAT FOR THE
 RICH AND THE POWERFUL, JUST NOT
 WORKING FOR ANYONE ELSE, AND HOW
 WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST
 THAT.
 SO I TALKED ABOUT IT EVERY
 SINGLE DAY AND ULTIMATELY I WENT
 FROM 17 POINTS BEHIND THAT GUY
 TO BEATING HIM BY 7 1/2.
 SO THE WAY I SEE IT IS HERE WE
 ARE IN A PRESIDENTIAL, AND IT'S
 THE SAME KIND OF YOU STAY AFTER
 IT EVERY DAY.
 ONE■ SAY YOU PERSIST.
 [ SE ]
 ORGANIZE, BUILD A GRASSROOTS
 MOVEMENT, FIGHT FOR WORKING
 PEOPLE, AND THAT'S HOW I'M GOING
 TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK
 BREAK.
 WE'LL BE BACK MORE WITH THE CNN
 PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL.

       Leave no man behind.
            Or child.
         Or other child.

 WELCOME BACK. WE'RE LIVE IN MANCHESTER, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, FOR A SPECIAL CNN
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL EVENT.
 FIVE TOWN HALL EVENTS TONIGHT.
 ALL OF THEM TAKING QUESTIONS
 FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS.
 RIGHT NOW IT IS SENATOR
 ELIZABETH WARREN'S TURN.
 I DO WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU HAVE
 CALLED FOR IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS TO BE INITIATED
 AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE
 DEMOCRATS THAT SAY THIS IS NOT
 THE TIME.
 IT WILL TAKE AWAY THE FOCUS FROM
 THE ELECTION IN 2020.
 SPEAKER PELOSI SAID SHE DIDN'T
 HAVE A PLAN TO DO IT.
 THERE IS NO POLITICAL
 CONVENIENCE TIME EXCEPTION TO
 THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
 THIS ONE IS -IF I CAN, I WANT
 TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME ON THIS
 BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS REALLY
 IMPORTANT.
 LAST THURSDAY I HAD BEEN OUT --
 I HAD BEEN TO SOUTH CAROLINA.
 THIS WAS ALL ABOUT CLIMATE
 CHANGE.
 THAT'S WHERE I WAS, SOUTH
 CAROLINA, COASTAL COMMUNITIES
 PROTESTING OFF SHORE DRILLING.
 I THEN CAME TO COLORADO, THE
 BIGGEST DROUGHT IN 1200 YEARS.
 AND THEN TO UTAH WHERE THEY HAD
 ONE OF THE WORST WILDFIRE
 SEASONS IN A GENERATION.
 I'M ON AN AIRPLANE AND THE
 MUELLER REPORT DROPS AND I START
 READING IT ON THROUGH THE
 EVENING, I READ IT INTO THE WEE
 HOURS OF THE MORNING AND WHEN I
 GET TO THE END, THREE THINGS
 JUST JUMP OFF THE PAGE.
 I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A
 DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN,
 INDEPENDENT, LIBERTARIAN,
 VEGETARIAN, THREE THINGS JUST
 TOTALLY JUMP OFF THE PAGE.
 THE FIRST IS THAT A HOSTILE
 FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ATTACKED OUR
 2016 ELECTION IN ORDER TO HELP
 DONALD TRUMP.
 THE EVIDENCE IS JUST THERE.
 READ IT, FOOTNOTE AFTER
 FOOTNOTE, PAGE AFTER PAGE
 DOCUMENTATION.
 PART TWO, DONALD TRUMP WELCOMED
 THAT HELP.
 SO ON THE FIRST ONE ABOUT WHAT
 THEY DID, UNDERSTAND, THIS WAS A
 SOPHISTICATED ATTACK.
 THEY ATTACKED PART OF VOTING
 SYSTEM.
 THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING
 FEDERAL SYSTEM.
 THEY HACKED INTO MORE THAN 50
 COMPUTERS AT THE DNC, THE DCCC.
 AYE VERY SERIOUS ATTACK.
 AND DONALD TRUMP WELCOMING IT.
 IN THE MUELLER REPORT, JUST READ
 IT.
 HE GETS OFF THE PHONE FROM AN
 UNNAMED CALLER AND LOOKS UP AND
 SAYS TO THE OTHER PERSON ON THE
 PHONE, THERE ARE MORE LEAKS
 COMING.
 THE IDEA THAT HE WAS WELCOMING
 WHAT WAS HAPPENING FROM THE
 RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, AND BY THE
 SUMMER OF 2016 THE REPORT
 DOCUMENTS THAT BY THAT POINT THE
 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -THE
 TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY HAD A
 WORKED OUT FORMAL PROCESS FOR
 DEALING WITH THE LEAKS THAT WERE
 COMING IN FROM THE RUSSIANS.
 SO THAT'S PART TWO.
 PART THREE IS WHEN THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT STARTS TO INVESTIGATE
 PART ONE AND PART TWO, DONALD
 TRUMP TOOK REPEATED STEPS
 AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO HALT THE
 INVESTIGATION, DERAIL THE
 INVESTIGATION, PUSH THE
 INVESTIGATION SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT
 OTHERWISE KEEP THAT
 INVESTIGATION FROM GOING FORWARD
 AND TURNING INTO A SERIOUS
 INVESTIGATION ABOUT A HOSTILE
 FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT IT
 ATTACKED US AND ABOUT HIS OWN
 PERSONAL INTERESTS.
 SO HERE'S HOW I SEE THIS.
 IF ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING IN THIS
 COUNTRY HAD DONE WHAT'S
 DOCUMENTED IN THE MUELLER
 REPORT, THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED
 AND PUT IN JAIL.
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS A
 SERIOUS CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY,
 BUT MUELLER BELIEVED BECAUSE OF
 THE DIRECTIONS FROM DONALD
 TRUMP'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT
 HE COULD NOT BRING A CRIMINAL
 INDICTMENT AGAINST A SITTING
 PRESIDENT.
 I THINK HE'S WRONG ON THAT, BUT
 THAT'S WHAT HE BELIEVED.
 SO HE SERVES THE WHOLE THING UP
 TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS
 AND SAYS IN EFFECT, IF THERE'S
 GOING TO BE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY,
 THAT ACCOUNTABILITY HAS TO COME
 FROM THE CONGRESS.
 AND THE TOOL T WE ARE GIVEN
 FOR THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE
 IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.
 THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, THIS
 IS ABOUT PRINCIPLE.
 THIS IS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF A
 DEMOCRACY WE HAVE.
 IN A DICTATORSHIP EVERYTHING IN
 GOVERNMENT REVOLVES AROUND
 PROTECTING THE ONE PERSON AT THE
 CENTER BUT NOT UNDER OUR
 DEMOCRACY AND NOT UNDER OUR
 CONSTITUTION.
 WE HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND
 WE HAVE TO PROCEED HERE IN A WAY
 UNDERSTANDING OUR PLACE IN
 HISTORY THAT NOT ONLY PROTECTS
 DEMOCRACY NOW BUT PROTECTS
 DEMOCRACY WHEN THE NEXT
 PRESIDENT COMES IN AND THE NEXT
 PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT
 AFTER THAT.
 BUT YOU --
 THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY.
 BUT YOU STARTED OFF BY
 SAYING -BY TALKING ABOUT SOME
 OF YOUR TRAVELS AND PEOPLE
 TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE,
 THEIR CONCERNS, TABLETOP ISSUES.
 YES.
 DOESN'T PUTTING A LOT OF
 PEOPLE'S FOCUS ON IMPEACHING THE
 PRESIDENT, IT WON'T GO ANYWHERE
 IN THAT SENSE, DOESN'T THAT TAKE
 AWAY FOCUS FROM THE TABLETOP
 ISSUES THAT YOU AND OTHER
 DEMOCRATS SAY YOU WANT TO RUN
 ON?
 IF YOU'VE ACTUALLY READ THE
 MUELLER REPORT, IT'S ALL LAID
 OUT THERE.
 IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE
 A LONG TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
 IT'S THERE.
 IT'S GOT THE FOOTNOTES, IT'S GOT
 THE POINTS, IT CONNECTS DIRECTLY
 TO THE LAW.
 BUT THIS REALLY IS
 FUNDAMENTALLY -I TOOK AN OATH
 TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION OF
 THE UNITED STATES AND SO DID
 EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE SENATE AND
 IN THE HOUSE, AND I BELIEVE THAT
 EVERY PERSON IN THE SENATE AND
 THE HOUSE OUGHT TO HAVE TO VOTE
 AND TO SAY EITHER, YEAH, THAT'S
 OKAY WITH ME.
 YEAH, LET A PRESIDENT JUST STEP
 IN THE WAY HE DID WHEN HE TOLD
 THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO GO
 FIRE MUELLER, AND THEN TOLD THE
 WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO GO LIE
 ABOUT HAVING TOLD THE WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL TO GO FIRE
 MUELLER, AND THEN TOLD THE WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL TO WRITE A LETTER
 SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT
 TOLD HIM TO GO FIRE MUELLER AND
 THEN TO SAY, WHY ON EARTH WOULD
 YOU TAKE NOTES ABOUT WHAT I SAID
 TO YOU?
 THE LAWYERS I DEAL WITH NEVER
 PUT ANYTHING IN WRITING.
 IF THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE
 OR THE SENATE WHO WANT TO SAY
 THAT'S WHAT A PRESIDENT CAN DO
 WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS BEING
 INVESTIGATED FOR HIS OWN
 WRONGDOINGS OR WHEN A FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENT ATTACKS OUR COUNTRY,
 THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE
 THAT VOTE AND LIVE WITH IT FOR
 THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I WANT YOU TO MEET -THIS IS
 CECELIA DARMS.
 SHE'S A SOPHOMORE AT HARVARD.
 SHE INTERNT FOR HILLARY
 CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
 HI.
 YOU ARE REGISTERED AS A
 REPUBLICAN IN 1995.
 I WAS.
 BUT YOU'VE SINCE BECOME ONE
 OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE
 IN CONGRESS.
 DID YOU CHANGE YOUR BELIEVES OR
 DO YOU BELIEVE THE POLITICAL
 PARTIES CHANGED AROUND YOU?CECE.
 I GREW UP IN A FAMILY THAT
 WASN'T POLITICAL.
 I GREW UP OUT IN OKLAHOMA AND TO
 THIS DAY I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW
 MY PARENTS WERE REGISTERED OR MY
 GRANDPARENTS OR MUCH OF ANYBODY
 ELSE.
  MY MOM ALWAYS VOTED.
 I KNOW THAT, AND IN FACT SHE
 WORKED AT THE POLLS SOMETIMES,
 BUT WE WEREN'T A POLITICAL
 FAMILY.
 AND WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MOM AND
 STRUGGLING TO TRY TO KEEP UP
 WITH MY JOB AND GET DINNER ON
 THE TABLE AND TAKE CARE OF A
 COUPLE OF LITTLE KIDS AND LAUNCH
 MY CAREER, I DIDN'T THINK MUCH
 ABOUT POLITICS.
 NOW I'VE BEEN A POLICY PERSON
 FOR A LONG, LONG TIME SO I THINK
 THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING ME IS
 WHEN DOES THE CHANGE COME?
 AND THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
 SO IN LATE HID 1990s I HAD BEEN
 WORKING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
 ON WHAT'S HAPPENING TO AMERICA'S
 WORKING FAMILIES, TO AMERICA'S
 MIDDLE CLASS, HOW IT IS THAT
 PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD, WHO PLAY
 BY THE RULES ARE JUST FINDING A
 PATH STEEPER AND ROCKIER YEAR BY
 YEAR AND FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR
 EVEN STEEPER AND EVEN ROCKIER.
 THIS IS MY LIFE'S WORK.
 SO I KEEP WORKING ON THIS ABOUT
 WHAT'S CHANGING IN AMERICA?
 I'M STUDYING FAMILIES THAT GO
 BANKRUPT, AND THE CREDIT CARD
 COMPANIES, HALF DOZEN GIANT
 CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FIGURE OUT
 THAT IF THEY CAN GET THE
 BANKRUPTCY LAWS CHANGED, THAT
 WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THEY CAN
 IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE BY
 JUST A LITTLE BY KEEPING PEOPLE
 LOCKED OUT OF BANKRUPTCY.
 NEVER MIND THAT THERE'S PEOPLE
 THAT ARE HEAD OVER HEELS IN
 MEDICAL DEBTS, THAT THEY'VE HAD
 JOB LOSSES OR A DEATH OR
 IN THE FAMILY BUT THEY'VE BEEN
 CHEATED BY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES
 AND MORTGAGE COMPANIES.
 NEVER MIND ANY OF THAT.
 I LOOKED AROUND THE MIDDLE OF
 THAT FIGHT AND I REALIZED ALL
 THE MONEY WAS ON ONE SIDE AND
 ALL THE HURTING WAS ON THE OTHER
 AND THAT'S WHEN I JUMPED IN
 POLITICALLY.
 I GOT IN THAT FIGHT AND I FOUGHT
 IT FOR TEN YEARS, AND BY THE END
 OF THAT FIGHT I FULLY UNDERSTOOD
 THAT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN
 STOOD THERE FOR THE BANKS AND
 HALF OF THE DEMOCRATS DID.
 SO MY PARTY WAS THE PARTY THAT
 AT LEAST WE GOT HALF OF THEM TO
 STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE, AND
 THAT WAS THE BIG CHANGE FOR ME.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I WANT YOU TO MEET --THIS
 IS ERIC JEMBA, A SOPHOMORE FROM
 HARVARD.
 YOU CAN TELL FROM HIS
 SWEATSHIRT.
 GREAT SWEATSHIRT.
 A FORMER INTERN FOR CORY
 BOOKER.
 HE'S CURRENTLY UNDECIDED WHO TO
 SUPPORT.
 HI.
 ENTITLEMENTS, THOUGH NOT THE
 SEXIEST ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSING.
 DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO REFORM OUR
 PRESENT SOCIAL SECURITY TO
 INCREASE ITS LONG GEFT?
 I'M REALLY GLAD YOU ASKED
 ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE
 THIS IS ONE THAT REMINDS YOU HOW
 THINGS HAVE BROKEN APART IN THIS
 COUNTRY.
 AS YOU ALTHOUGH, SOCIAL SECURITY
 PASSED BACK DURING THE GREAT
 DEPR
 DEPRESSION.
 IT WAS TOO NARROW AND CUT OUT
 TOO MANY -PARTICULARLY, JOBS
 UP THERE TO BE HELD BUT SOCIAL
 SECURITY BECAME A MAINSTAY.
 AND FROM THE 1930s UNTIL THE
 LATE 1980s WE UNDERSTOOD THAT
 SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT SOMETHING
 YOU CAN SET ONCE AND GO.
 GOING BACK TO WORK CHANGES, HOW
 MANY PEOPLE GET SICK, RIGHT?
 AND SO EVERY FEW YEARS FOR A
 VERY LONG TIME WE KEPT MAKING
 LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS, AND THAT WAY
 SOCIAL SECURITY STAYED ON A
 TRACK TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WOULD
 BE THERE FOR YOUR GENERATION AND
 THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE NEXT
 GENERATION AFTER THAT.
 IN THE LATE 1980s THE
 REPUBLICANS JUST SAID, NO, THAT
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ANYMORE
 CHANGES.
 NOT GOING TO KEEP THE CHANGES.
 THE CONSEQUENCE IS EVERY TIME WE
 GET IT DOWN IT'S A LITTLE
 FURTHER OUT OF WHACK.
 THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE GOT
 ROUGHLY -I HAVEN'T CHECKED THE
 NUMBERS.
 ABOUT 20 MORE YEARS WHERE WE ARE
 IF WE DO NOTHING.
 WHEN IT DROPS, IT WOULD DROP BY
 ROUGHLY 25% AND THEN LEVEL OUT
 AND BE THERE.
 SO IT'S NOT THAT IT WILL
 DISAPPEAR FOR YOUR GENERATION.
 HERE'S THE DEAL.
 THIS IS ONE MORE OF THOSE
 PROBLEMS, A LITTLE LIKE CLIMATE,
 THE SOONER YOU FIX IT, THE
 EASIER IT IS TO FIX.
 NOW IT'S ALREADY HARD ON THIS
 FRONT BUT IT'S ONE OF THESE
 THINGS WE NEED TO FIX NOW.
 BUT THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT, NOT
 THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS --
 WELL, NOT EVERYBODY
 UNDERSTANDS THE MATH.
 THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE
 WHO UNDERSTAND THE MATH.
 THE PROBLEM IS THE POLITICAL
 WILL AND THE WILLINGNESS TO STEP
 UP AND SAY, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE
 ADJUSTMENTS.
 WE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS -I
 BELIEVE WE NEED TO BEND THE
 CURVES THEY'RE CALLED SO THAT
 PARTICULARLY WOMEN WHO HAD LOWER
 EARNINGS FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT
 THEY WERE WORKING GET BETTER
 SUPPORT IN THEIR LATER YEARS,
 BUT AT THIS MOMENT THERE'S NO
 POLITICAL WILL TO COME TOGETHER.
 THERE'S NO ONE WILLING TO DRIVE
 THIS.
 WHY?
 BECAUSE WASHINGTON KEEPS WORKING
 FOR THOSE AT THE TOP.
 IT'S NOT WORKING FOR PEOPLE WHO
 ARE RELYING ON SOCIAL SECURITY.
 YOUR QUESTION WAS IS THIS
 SOMETHING -THE PLAN IS NOT
 HARD.
 IT'S POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE IT
 HAPPEN.
 I'M WILLING TO TAKE ON THAT
 FIGHT.
 IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIGHT.
 SO THANK YOU.
 THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
 NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MATT
 SPRANT.
 HE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM
 COLLEGE TO WORK AS A FULL-TIME
 STAFFER FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN
 THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.
 HI, MAX.
 SENATOR WARREN, I WANT TO SAY
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
 THANK YOU.
 MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH
 THE POLITICS OF THIS RACE.
 IN PARTICULAR, I KNOW THAT YOU
 HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESIDENT
 TRUMP'S NAME-CALLING AND
 BULLYING FIRSTHAND AND GIVEN THE
 SUCCESS THAT HE'S HAD WITH THESE
 TACTICS IN THE PAST, I WAS
 WONDERING HOW YOU WOULD PROPOSE
 TO COUNTER THEM IF YOU WERE TO
 BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE.
 IN PARTICULAR, ARE YOU AFRAID HE
 CAN CARICATURE YOU?
 SO, THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
 YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN AROUND THIS
 BLOCK BEFORE.
 BACK IN 2012 WHEN I RAN AGAINST
 THAT VERY POPULAR REPUBLICAN
 INCUMBENT.
 HE RAN THE SAME PLAY AND WHAT I
 DISCOVERED AT THAT POINT IS
 AROUND THE COMMONWEALTH PEOPLE
 CARE A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT
 THEIR FAMILIES THAN THEY DO
 ABOUT SOME KIND OF NAME-CALLING.
 I GOT IN THE RACE IN '12 AND I
 GOT IN THIS RACE RIGHT NOW AS A
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NOT
 BECAUSE I LOOKED AT MYSELF IN
 THE MER ROHR EVERY DAY.
 OH, SENATOR, PRESIDENT?
 IT WASN'T THAT AT ALL.
 IT'S MY LIFE'S WORK.
 I GREW UP IN A FAMILY THAT WAS
 PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.
 I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS WHO HAD
 A DREAM.
 WE TALKED ABOUT COLLEGE.
 I'VE KNOWN WHAT I'VE WANDED TO
 DO SINCE SECOND GRADE.
 HAVE WE HEARD FROM ERICA'S
 PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS?
 COME ON, GUYS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
 BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN MY
 FAMILY.
 BY THE TIME I GRADUATED FROM
 HIGH SCHOOL, THERE WAS NO MONEY
 EVEN FOR COLLEGE APPLICATION
 MUCH LESS TO SEND ME OFF TO FOUR
 YEARS OF COLLEGE.
 I HAVE A TWISTED STORY.
 LIKE SOME AMERICANS DO.
 WE'RE NOT ALL ON A STATE LINE.
 THE GOOD NEWS IS I WON A
 SCHOLARSHIP, YEAH.
 AND THEN AT 19 I FELL IN LOVE.
 YEAH.
 AND THEN I GOT MARRIED.
 YEAH.
 THEN I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL,
 YEAH.
 AND I TOOK A JOB ANSWERING
 PHONES, AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS
 GOING TO BE MY LIFE FOREVER.
 A GOOD LIFE, BUT NOT THE DREAM I
 HAD.
 AND THEN I FOUND A COMMUTER
 COLLEGE THAT COST $50 A
 SEMESTER, AND FOR A PRICE THAT I
 COULD PAY FOR ON A PART-TIME
 WAITRESSING JOB, I HAD A CHANCE
 TO GET A FOUR YEAR DIPLOMA AND
 BECOME A SPECIAL NEEDS TEACHER.
 I HAD LIVED MY DREAM.
 AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE
 BEST OF AMERICA, WHEN WE OPEN
 MORE DOORS FOR MORE PEOPLE.
 I WANT TO LIVE IN AN AMERICA
 THAT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BORN
 OPPORTUNITY BUT THAT'S FOR
 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US.
 JUST THOSE FEW PIECES I PUT
 TOMPGT A 2 CENT WEALTH TAX WOULD
 LET US DO UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE,
 WOULD LET US DO UNIVERSAL PRE-K,
 WOULD LET US NOT BACK THE
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN AND
 STILL HAVE MONEY TO SEND.
 I THINK THIS IS THE PACE WE'VE
 GOT TO MAKE AGAINST DONALD
 TRUMP.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN BY SAYING
 NOT DONALD TRUMP.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN BY DOING
 BETTER NAME-CALLING THAN HE
 DOES.
 THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS,
 WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT AND TALK
 ABOUT OUR VISION AND HOW IT
 AFFECTS FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THE
 COUNTRY AND WE'RE GOING TO
 INVITE PEOPLE NOT JUST TO VOTE
 BUT TO COME OFF THE SIDELINES
 AND BE PART OF THIS.
 TO GET ENGAGED.
 TO VOLUNTEER, TO KICK IN FIVE
 BUCKS TO GO TO EE LIT BEZ W
 WARREN.
 WHAT'S AT STAKE IS NOT ONLY OUR
 ECONOMIC FUTURE, IT IS ALSO OUR
 DEMOCRACY.
 I'M IN THIS FIGHT ALL THE WAY.
 I THINK WE MAKE THAT CASE AND I
 THINK THE PEOPLE ARE WITH US.
 WE'LL HAVE MORE.
 STAY WITH US.

       Thanks to Priceline

    to turn their unsold seats       into amazing deals,
 family reunion attendance is up.
   We're all related!
         Yeah, I see it.
      And because Priceline      offers great deals
     by comparing thousands     of prices in real time,

            Various:            Yeah-h-h!
          Is that safe?
        Oh, y...                 Ahh!
       Not at all. No, ma'am.                        Nope.

 WELCOME BACK. WE'RE LIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR
 A SPECIAL CNN DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL.
 SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN FROM
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 I WANT TO -OUR NEXT QUESTION
 IS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.
 GOOD.
 YOU TALKED ABOUT IT BRIEFLY.
 IT'S DRASTICALLY GROWN IN A POLL
 TODAY.
 THIS IS TYELER PIERCE.
 HE'S STUDYING BIOMEDICAL
 SCIENCE, WHICH I'M INTO THE EVEN
 SURE WHAT THAT MEANS, BECAUSE
 I'M DUMB.
 HE WORKED AS A FELLOW FOR THE
 NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 MID TERMS.
 HI, SENATOR, HOW ARE YOU?
 I'M GOOD.
 WHAT WILL YOU DO TO COMBAT
 CLIMATE CHANGE?
 TYLER, IT IS THE EXISTENTIAL
 QUESTION RIGHT NOW.
 AS I SAID, I WAS JUST OUT IN
 THREE DIFFERENT STATES FACING
 CLIMATE -THE EFFECTS OF
 CLIMATE CHANGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
 BUT ALL OF THEM POTENTIALLY
 DEVASTATING.
 I HAVE AN 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON
 AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD
 IS GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN HE'S

 WILL IT BE A PLACE WHERE THE
 MIDWEST HAS BURNED UP?
 WHERE WE HAVE LOST OUR GREAT
 FORESTS?
 WILL IT BE A PLACE WHERE LARGE
 PARTS OF THE OCEANS ARE DEAD?
 WILL IT BE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE
 AROUND THE WORLD ARE JUST
 FIGHTING FOR CLEAN WATER?
 WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO
 MAKE A CHANGE.
 WE MUST MAKE CHANGE AND WE MUST
 MAKE IT NOW.
 SO HERE'S HOW I SEE THIS.
 I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF GREEN
 NEW DEAL.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY.
 THERE'S TWO PRINCIPLE REASONS
 FOR THAT.
 THE FIRST REASON THAT I'M A
 STRONG SUPPORTER IS ITS A WAY
 FOR URGENCY.
 WE CANNOT WAIT LONGER.
 WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE.
 THAT'S HOW I HEAR THIS.
 THE SECOND PART ABOUT THE GREEN
 NEW DEAL IS THAT IT CALLS FOR A
 HUGE INVESTMENT IN OUR
 INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK
 THAT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.
 AND WHEN I SAY OUR
 INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S ABOUT OUR
 POWER INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO
 ABOUT HARDENING OUR
 INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN
 WITH STAND THE STORM AND MOVE TO
 POWER.
 LOTS OF PIECES THAT WE NEED TO
 DO BUT I ALSO SEE THIS AS A TIME
 WHEN IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK.
 THAT IS WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHINA
 LET ME JUST DO A COUPLE THAT THE
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 CAN DO ALL BY HERSELF.
 I JUST PUT OUT A PLAN ON FIRST
 DAY OF MY ADMINISTRATION I WILL
 PUT IN PLACE A MORITORIUM.
 NO NEW DRILLING, NO NEW MINING
 ON FEDERAL LANDS, PERIOD.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WE SHOULD NOT BE SELLING OUT
 FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR TO
 MINING COMPANIES AND TO OIL
 COMPANIES OUR NATIONAL
 TREASURES.
 I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER LITTLE
 PIECE OF THIS AND THAT IS 10,000
 JOBS.
 FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SPEND A
 YEAR IN THE NATIONAL PARKS AND
 NATIONAL FORESTS TO BE ABLE TO
 GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THE LAND
 AND MAKE REPAIRS.
 THIS IS A PART OF WHAT WE CAN DO
 TOGETHER.
 HOW ABOUT A COUPLE OF MORE
 PIECES?
 THE UNITED STATES IS A WORLD
 LEADER ON CLIMATE.
 WE ARE.
 WE'RE JUST LEADING IN THE WRONG
 DIRECTION NOW.
 THAT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT'S
 NOT ONLY WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG
 BUT WE'RE GIVING COVER TO THE
 REST OF THE WORLD.
 FOR EVERYBODY THAT DOESN'T WANT
 TO TAKE THE TOUGH STEPS AND
 DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE CHANGES.
 WE'RE GIVING THEM COVER.
 WE BECOME A WORLD LEADER IN THE
 DIRECTION OF A SUSTAINABLE
 EARTH.
 CAN I THROW IN ONE MORE?
 THAT'S NO COAL LOBBISTS ARE HEAD
 OF THE EPA.
 ONE MORE QUESTION FROM THE
 AUDIENCE.
 HI, NICHOLAS.
 AS A DEMOCRAT THAT HAS A LOT
 OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR
 PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT THINKS LIKE
 EVERY PRESIDENT HE HAD HIS
 SHORTCOMINGS.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE
 PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE IN THE
 WAY THAT YOU WOULD APPROACH YOUR
 JOB AS PRESIDENT AND THE WAY
 PRESIDENT OBAMA APPROACHED HIS
 JOB?
 I'M GOING TO TAKE IT IN A
 LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DIRECTION
 IF I CAN.
 NO, NO, I'M GOING TO GET HERE.
 SO I SPENT AS I TOLD ALL OF YOU
 REALLY MY WHOLE LIFE'S WORK INTO
 WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH WORKING
 FAMILIES.
 STARTING IN THE EARLY 2000S, THE
 CRISIS WAS COMING.
 I WAS WAVING MY ARM, RINGING THE
 BELL, DOING EVERYTHING I COULD.
 I SAID FAMILIES ARE GETTING
 CHEATED ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.
 IT START WHEN THE MORTGAGE
 COMPANIES TARGETED COMMUNITIES
 OF COLOR.
 THEY TARGETED SENIORS.
 THEY TARGETED LATINOS.
 THEY CAME IN AND TARGETED THE
 WORST OUT OF THE COMMUNITIES AND
 TALKED ABOUT IT TO ANYONE THAT
 WOULD LISTEN A CRISIS IS COMING.
 IF YOUR EARS ARE STUFFED WITH
 MONEY IT'S HARD TO HEAR.
 SO THE CRISIS HIT IN 2007-2008
 AND JUST TOOK US DOWN.
 THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU
 GOING TO DO GOING FORWARD?
 A LOT OF FOLKS WHAT WE SHOULD DO
 IS JUST TAKE CARE OF THE BIG
 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
 WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS
 NEVER HAPPENS TO WORKING
 FAMILIES AGAIN.
 SO THE IDEA I HAD, CONSUMER
 FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, I
 SAID I'M GOING TO GET IN THIS
 FIGHT.
 I'M A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.
 I HAVE NO POLITICAL SWAY BUT I'M
 GOING TO GET IN THIS FIGHT AND
 FIGHT FOR IT.
 PEOPLE TOLD ME TWO THINGS.
 GREAT IDEA.
 DON'T EVEN TRY.
 THE REASON NOT TO TRY IS THERE'S
 NO WAY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH
 YOU'LL EVER GET THIS PASSED
 BECAUSE THE GIANT FINANCIAL
 INSTITUTIONS WILL FIGHT YOU
 EVERY INCH OF THE WAY.
 WE HAVE TO WRAP IT UP.
 ALL RIGHT.
 SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
 I GOT IN THE FIGHT.
 PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED IT INTO
 LAW AND HE WAS THE ONE WHO STOOD
 THERE WHEN EVERYONE ELSE SAID IN
 HIS ADMINISTRATION THROW THAT
 AGENCY UNDER THE BUS AND HE SAID
 NO I'M NOT GOING TO LET THIS
 CRISIS PASS AND NOT COME AWAY
 WITH A CONSUMER AGENCY THAT
 MAKES SURE THAT FAMILIES EVER
 GET CHEATED AGAIN.
 I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO THE
 PRESIDENT FOR THAT.
 UP NEXT, VERMONT SENATOR,
 BERNIE SANDERS.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
