 MANY YEARS. DR. OZ: WHY DID YOU NOT LOSE
 YOUR LEG?
 IT HAD GANGRENE.
 I WAS TAKEN TO THE BALTIMORE
 SHOCK TRAUMA CENTER WHERE I HAD
 HYPERBARIC TREATMENTS.
 DR. OZ: CUTTING-EDGE BUT THEN.
 IT WAS CUTTING-EDGE.
 IT WAS ALSO PAINFUL.
 BUT IT HELPED TO SAVE ME.
 DR. OZ: YOU STILL HAVE BULLETS
 IN YOUR BODY.
 I STILL CARRY TWO BULLETS.
 DR. OZ: GOING THROUGH ALL OF
 THAT AND REALIZING THE MAGNITUDE
 OF THE TRAGEDY AT JONESTOWN MUST
 HAVE BEEN VERY CHALLENGING.
 IT WAS.
 I LOST MY MENTOR, THE MAN I
 WORKED FOR WHO I BELIEVED WAS
 DOING THE RIGHT THING TRYING TO
 SAVE HIS CONSTITUENTS.
 900 PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE LOST,
 MANY OF WHOM I INTERACTED WITH
 OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS.
 THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE'S LIVES
 WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE.
 BUT IT WAS HORRIFIC ON SO MANY
 LEVELS BECAUSE OUR LOCAL
 GOVERNMENTS DID NOT RESPOND
 PROPERLY TO CAUSE THERE WAS ALL
 THIS ABUSE GOING ON.
 OUR STATE DEPARTMENT DID NOT
 OPERATE AS IT SHOULD IN TERMS OF
 PROTECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS
 ABROAD.
 IT WAS A VERY SAD TALE ALL THE
 WAY AROUND.
 DR. OZ: WHAT MAKES ME ADMIRE YOU
 SO MUCH.
 YOU GET THROUGH THAT.
 SHE HAS A WONDERFUL BOOK WHERE
 SHE TALKS ABOUT THESE THINGS
 VERY OPENLY.
 TWO MISCARRIAGES.
 YOU LOST A WONDERFUL HUSBAND
 WHILE YOU WERE PREGNANT WITH HER
 SECOND CHILD.
 YOU CANNOT PUT THE STORIES
 TOGETHER.
 HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO STAY STRONG
 THROUGH THAT?
 HOW DO YOU FIND MEANING INSTEAD
 OF ALL OF THIS LOSS?
 THE BOOK IS REALLY ABOUT
 RESILIENCE.
 WE DON'T KNOW HOW RESILIENT WE
 REALLY ARE.
 BUT IF WE SURROUND OURSELVES
 WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND FAITH,
 WE CAN OVERCOME VIRTUALLY
 ANYTHING.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THERE WERE DAYS I DID NOT
 WANT TO GET UP.
 [APPLAUSE]
 WHEN I DID NOT WANT TO GET UP
 ON THOSE DAYS, I WOULD GIVE
 MYSELF PERMISSION TO STAY IN
 BED.
 BUT THEN I ALSO DEMANDED I GET
 UP THE NEXT DAY.
 AND SO, IT IS A COMBINATION OF
 BEING KIND TO YOURSELF BUT ALSO
 BEING SOMEWHAT RESOLUTE AND
 DEMANDING OF YOURSELF, TOO.
 DR. OZ: FAMILY, FAITH, AND
 FRIENDS.
 I WOULD ADD FOOD AND FUN.
 THAT IS GOOD, TOO.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU FOR DEDICATING
 YOUR LIFE TO SERVICE.
 HER BOOK IS AVAILABLE NOW.
 ENJOY IT.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

      When you feed yourself            some oats,
  the oats feed your body fiber.
     Fiber helps keep things   moving through your system.
         Which is great.
     Because when you're good         to your system,
      it'll be good to you.
 I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS. IN PAST INVESTIGATIONS, WE
 REVEALED MAJOR RETAILERS
 RESTOCKING USED UNDERWEAR AS IF
 NEW.
 WE BOUGHT THEM, REMOVED THE TAX,
 SECRETLY MARKED THEM, AND
 RETURNED THEM.
 SURE ENOUGH, RIGHT BACK ON THE
 SALES FLOOR THEY WENT.
 IN ANOTHER INVESTIGATION, WE
 DETECTED FECAL MATTER AND
 BACTERIA, EVEN BLOOD, ON
 STORE-BOUGHT UNDERWEAR.
 NOW I AM GOING UNDERCOVER WITH
 HIDDEN CAMERAS TO BUY A VARIETY
 OF UNDERWEAR TO FIND OUT IF
 CONTAMINATED PRODUCTS ARE STILL
 BEING SOLD.
 I AM VISITING A NUMBER OF
 NATIONAL RETAIL CHAINS, BOTH
 UPSCALE MERCHANTS AND DISCOUNT
 VENDORS.
 CONSIDERING WHAT WE FOUND ON
 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS, I WAS
 CURIOUS ABOUT THE RETURN POLICY
 FOR UNDERWEAR.
 YOU CANNOT BRING THEM BACK?
 PUT IN THE SAME STORE, I GOT
 A DIFFERENT ANSWER AT THE
 REGISTER.
 YOU CAN BRING IT BACK.
 AT ANOTHER RETAILER, THE SAME
 CONFLICTING RETURN POLICY.
 NO RETURNS?
 STILL, EVERYONE ASSURED ME IF
 UNDERWEAR WERE RETURNED, IT
 WOULD NOT GO BACK OUT ON THE
 STORE SHELVES.
 IF THE UNDERWEAR COMES BACK

 YOU DO WHAT?
 DAMAGE IT.
 YOU DON'T PUT IT BACK OUT?
 BUT THE EVIDENCE WILL SPEAK
 FOR ITSELF.
 I'M ASKING OUR TEAM TO CATALOG
 AND SHIP A NUMBER OF SAMPLES TO
 THE LABORATORY FOR TESTING.
 COULD THE UNDERWEAR YOU ARE
 BUYING AS NEW BE DIRTY?
 DR. OZ: THE RESULTS OF OUR
 UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION INTO
 DIRTY DRAWERS IS IN.
 WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT IF
 RETAILERS ARE STILL FILLING --
 SELLING FILTHY UNDERWEAR.
 ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD
 WONDERING, REALLY?
 EVERYONE IS MOANING.
 LOOK AT THE SURPRISING STATS
 FROM MY ONLINE POLL.
 ALMOST 20% SAY THEY HAVE
 RETURNED UNDERWEAR BEFORE.
 THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE.
 MORE THAN HALF SAY THEY EVEN
 WORE UNDERWEAR BEFORE WASHING
 THEM.
 WE LOOKED AT THE STORE POLICIES
 AND FOUNDER IS NO GUARANTEE THAT
 THE UNDERWEAR YOU ARE BUYING IS
 CLEAN.
 IT COULD HAVE BEEN RETURNED AND
 PUT BACK.
 MY TEAM TESTED UNDERWEAR FOR
 MULTIPLE RETAILERS.
 WE ASKED IN VIEWERS TO BRING IN
 SHOPPING SAMPLES.
 WHAT WE FOUND IS PROBABLY NOT
 WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING.
 NINE OUT OF THE 11 SAMPLES WE
 TESTED HAD SOME SORT OF
 CONTAMINATION.
 NINE OUT OF 11.
 ACCORDING TO OUR SAMPLES, WE
 WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THEY HAVE
 NOT BEEN WORN.
 THAT IS GOOD NEWS.
 SOMEHOW, THEY GOT CONTAMINATED
 ALONG THE WAY WITHOUT HAVING
 BEEN WORN.
 SHE IS HERE TO HELP US ANALYZE
 THE RESULTS.
 HOW DO YOU THINK THEY GOT
 CONTAMINATED IF NOT FROM PEOPLE
 WEARING THEM?
 IF NOT FROM PEOPLE WEARING
 THEM, IT CAN BE THAT PEOPLE
 TOUCH IT.
 THESE THINGS COME IN BINS.
 THOSE ARE PROBABLY NOT CLEANED.
 THEY ARE SHIPPED FROM OTHER
 COUNTRIES.
 THEY ARE SHIPPED FROM OTHER
 PLACES.
 SOME OF US DO NOT WASH OUR
 HANDS.
 I SAW A WOMAN THE OTHER DAY WHO
 PICKED UP A BINKY AND PUT IT
 BACK IN HER KID'S MATH.
 IN SOME RETAIL STORES, THERE ARE
 BINS AND BINS OF UNDERWEAR.
 YOU SEE EVERYBODY GOING THROUGH
 IT.
 DR. OZ: WERE YOU TOLD BY YOUR
 MOM TO WASH YOUR UNDERWEAR
 BEFORE YOU WORE IT?
 OH, YES.
 DR. OZ: HOW MANY OF YOU WERE
 TOLD THAT?
 THANKFULLY, ALMOST ALL OF THE
 WOMEN HEARD THIS.
 THROUGH THE SURVEY, I LEARNED
 ONLY HALF OF US ARE DOING IT.
 KIMBERLY IS TAKING A DEEP DIVE
 INTO WHAT WE FOUND.
 DID YOUR MOM TELL YOU TO WASH
 HER UNDERWEAR?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: WE WANT TO SEE IF IT IS
 CLEAN.
 THERE WE ARE.
 THERE IS SOME UNDERWEAR.
 YOU BROUGHT YOUR UNDERWEAR.
 THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND.
 ARE YOU READY TO HEAR THIS?
 NO.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: WE ACTUALLY FOUND
 COLIFORM IN THE UNDERWEAR.
 I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE.
 ALMOST ALL OF THE SAMPLES TESTED
 POSITIVE FOR THE MAXIMUM LEVELS
 OF THIS BACTERIA, WHICH IS
 SURPRISING TO ME.
 WHAT CAN IT DO TO YOU?
 IT INCLUDES BACTERIA LIKE E.
 COLI.
 BY THE WAY, ALL OF THOSE
 BACTERIA COME FROM THE BOWEL.
 HE COMES FROM FECES, HUMAN
 FECES.
 IF YOU GET CONTAMINATED WITH IT,
 NOT ONLY CAN YOU GET FRAGILE --
 VAGINAL DISCHARGE.
 YOU CAN GET DIARRHEA, A URINARY
 TRACT INFECTION.
 DR. OZ: HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU
 FEEL?
 NOT GOOD.
 YOU REALLY HAVE TO WASH
 EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU WEAR IT.
 DR. OZ: IT SORT OF MAKES SENSE.
 PEOPLE DON'T CLEAN THEMSELVES
 BEFORE THEY PICK IT UP AND PUT
 IT DOWN.
 THESE ARE BACTERIA UBIQUITOUSLY
 AROUND.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY PRODUCTS
 THAT HAVE IT AND CAN GIVE IT TO
 YOU.
 I DON'T WANT TO MESS UP THE
 STAGE.
 NEXT IS KENNEDY.
 KENNEDY BROUGHT AS AN UNDERWEAR
 SAMPLE AS WELL.
 I DON'T WANT TO CONTAMINATE
 THIS.
 IT IS A NICE COLOR, BY THE WAY.
 I LIKE THAT.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE
 ABLE TO TELL THEY ARE
 COLOR-COORDINATED, BUT YOU KNOW.
 IN YOUR SAMPLE, WE DETECTED A
 SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNGUS.
 WHAT?
 DR. OZ: FUNGUS IS DIFFERENT FROM
 BACTERIA.
 THIS IS A CONCERN EVEN THOUGH IT
 IS A SMALL AMOUNT.
 IT IS A CONCERN.
 THERE IS FUNGUS AMONG US, AS I
 ALWAYS SAY.
 YOU CAN GET A USED INFECTION.
 YOU CAN BE ON YOUR SKIN.
 ON THE VULVA.
 I'M CONCERNED THAT HIS BODILY
 FLUID.
 THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT HAS A
 TAMPON.
 SOMETIMES ON THE STRING, YOU CAN
 SEE A LITTLE BIT OF BLOOD.
 THAT IS ALSO ON THE PANTY.
 EAST AND FUNGUS?
 NO.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HIV AND
 HEPATITIS.
 DR. OZ: I AM NOT TRYING TO PANIC
 YOU.
 HIGHLY UNLIKELY YOU WILL GET HIV

 YOU ARE NOT SAFE FROM
 ANYTHING.
 YOU HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN
 EVERYTHING YOU DO, BUY, SAY.
 IT IS CRAZY.
 DR. OZ: YOU ARE SAFE IF YOU WASH
 IT.
 IF YOU WASH IT.
 DR. OZ: OR SO IT SEEMS.
 FIND OUT HOW THESE UNDERWEAR CAN
 MAKE YOU SICK EVEN IF YOU WASH
 THEM BEFORE WEARING THEM.
 STICK AROUND.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH OUR
 UNDERCOVER UNDERWEAR
 INVESTIGATION.
 DR. MINAYA IS BACK.
 NINE OUT OF 11 SAMPLES WERE
 CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA.
 ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY, LESS
 THAN HALF OF US WASH THEM BEFORE
 WE WEAR THEM.
 EVEN IF YOU WASH THEM, WE
 UNCOVERED A SURPRISING WAY THAT
 YOUR SHOPPING STYLE STILL MAKE
 YOU SICK.
 LOOK AT WHAT HOUR UNDER CAMERA
 --UNDERCOVER CAMERAS CAUGHT.
 AS WE ARE WATCHING THIS
 VIDEO, THE WOMAN IS PUTTING ALL
 OF THE GARMENTS TOGETHER.
 EVEN IF YOU HAD A CONTAMINATED
 UNDERWEAR OF ANY SORT, NOW YOUR
 SWEATER IS IN THERE.
 A SWEATER YOU MIGHT NOT WASH
 BECAUSE YOU HAVE DINNER PLANS
 LATER ON.
 THAT MEANS IT WILL GO ON YOUR
 LIPS.
 YOU WILL LIFT YOUR LIPS, RIGHT?
 THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
 SOMETIMES IT IS SO SCARY.
 WATCHING THAT VIDEO DEMONSTRATES
 WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.
 DR. OZ: LET'S SAY YOU ARE
 SHOPPING.
 THIS IS THE UNDERWEAR.
 THIS IS THE COLIFORM OR FUNGUS.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE MUCH.
 YOU TAKE IT OUT AND PUT IT IN
 THE BACK.
 EVEN IF THERE WAS NO BACTERIA,
 YOU PUT IT ON THE SURFACE.
 THE SURFACE, YOU MAY HAVE BOUGHT
 -SOMEONE MAY HAVE BOUGHT WHOLE
 TREAT THE LASH POULTRY OR
 SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
 THAT GETS PUT IN YOUR REGULAR
 BAG THAT YOU ARE CARRYING
 AROUND.
 YOU HAVE YOUR BEAUTIFUL SHIRT OR
 SWEATER YOU SPOKE ABOUT.
 SEE THE LITTLE SPECKS?
 YOUR UNDERWEAR CONTAMINATED
 EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE BAG.
 AND MADE IT BAD FOR THE NEXT
 PERSON.
 THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING
 ABOUT.
 YOU HAVE TO BE HYPER CAREFUL
 ABOUT HOW YOU TREAT THE
 UNDERWEAR.
 WE REACHED OUT TO THE AMERICAN
 APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR
 ASSOCIATION.
 THEY DID NOT RESPOND WITH
 COMMENT BEFORE THE TAPING OF THE
 SHOW.
 I HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS.
 WHEN YOU BUY IT, TRY TO WRAP IT
 SEPARATELY SO YOU WILL NOT PUT
 IT NEXT TO SOMETHING YOU WILL BE
 ROLLING YOUR MOUTH THROUGH.
 YOU HAVE TIPS ON HOW TO WASH
 THAT WILL COME IN HANDY.
 THE FIRST THING IS WASHING
 MACHINE AND HOT WATER.
 REMEMBER THAT THESE THINGS COME
 FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.
 THEY CAN BE IN FORMALDEHYDE THAT
 CAN GIVE YOU A RASH.
 I WAS A WASH THEM RIGHT AWAY.
 THAT INCLUDES ALL OF YOUR
 GARMENTS.
 PLEASE USE HOT WATER.
 ADD A LITTLE VINEGAR.
 IT DOES KILL BACTERIA.
 DO NOT USE BLEACH.
 THAT IS AN IRRITANT TO THE VULVA
 SO PLEASE DON'T USE THAT.
 DR. OZ: YOU CONTROL YOUR
 DESTINY.
 DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT IT.
 FIX THE PROBLEM.
 TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT.
 IT MAKES US ALL HEALTHIER.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE
 SKINCARE ITEM WE HAVE BEEN
 FOLLOWING SINCE BEFORE IT BECAME
 A TREND.
 MY DAUGHTER TURNED ME ON TO
 THEM.
 SHE IS A DEVOTED FAN.
 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM.
 SOME WITH FUNNY FACES.
 SOME A LITTLE SCARY.
 LOOK AT THAT ONE.
 THEY PROMISE TO CLEAN AND
 TIGHTEN THE PORES, TO LOCK IN
 ALL OF THAT MOISTURE SO IT
 CANNOT GO ANYWHERE.
 YOU WANT THAT MOISTURE.
 IT IS GOOD, IDEALLY.
 AND IT PROMISES TO MAKE YOU
 GLOW, LIGHT UP, WHICH IS WHAT
 MANY FOLKS WANT.
 FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, WE TEST
 THESE SHEET MASKS WITH
 CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY TO FIND
 OUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO YOUR
 SKIN.
 ARE THEY DOING ANYTHING AT ALL?
 HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR US IS
 DERMATOLOGIST DR. JEANINE
 DOWNIE.
 WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ON THE
 MARKET?
 IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF LUXURY.
 YOU LAY DOWN AND PUT IT ON YOUR
 FACE.
 YOU SOAK ALL THE GOOD STUFF IN.
 YOU CAN DESTRESS YOU SO PEOPLE
 LOVE IT.
 THEY ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE.
 THEY CAN ANTI-AGE YOU AND
 REHYDRATE YOU.
 IT IS A SIMPLE THING.
 YOU TAKE IT AND TOSS IT WHEN YOU
 ARE DONE.
 DR. OZ: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS
 IN THESE.
 THE INGREDIENTS MAKE A BIG
 DIFFERENCE.
 THEY FEEL GOOD TO ME.
 I DO USE MASKS.
 I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS IN THEM.
 YOU LOOKED INTO THIS.
 THEY HAVE GLYCOL.
 THAT IS A HUMECTANT.
 THAT DRAWS MOISTURE INTO YOUR
 SKIN.
 THEY HAVE HIGHER LAW ON IT --
 HYOLURONIC ACID.
 THEY ARE POPULAR BECAUSE THEY
 HAVE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS THAT
 THEORETICALLY SHOULD WORK WELL
 DEPENDING ON WHAT LEVELS AND
 QUANTITIES THEY ARE IN.
 DR. OZ: I HAVE SEEN THAT BUT I
 HAVE SEEN UGLY REPORTS ABOUT A
 DIFFERENT REALITY WITH THESE.
 THESE MASKS ARE BEING PACKAGED
 WITH BARE HANDS.
 WHATEVER IS ON YOUR HANDS IS ON
 THAT MASK.
 THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE PUTTING
 ON THEIR FACE.
 THAT IS IN A PRIVATE HOME.
 NOT ANY KIND OF HYGIENE RULES.
 SOMEONE EVEN GOT A HAIR STUCK
 INSIDE THE PLASTIC.
 A LOT OF THESE ARE PACKAGED
 OVERSEAS.
 IS ANYONE TESTING TO MAKE SURE
 THEY ARE SAFE?
 BASICALLY, THEY ARE A
 COSMETIC THAT HAS A
 PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE OF
 ACTIVITY.
 THEY ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE
 FDA.
