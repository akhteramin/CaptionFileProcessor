What's my favorite color today? Pink. Yup. But Corey seems to be the pain in their ass that won't go away. Chad and Nicole's relationship is moving to the next level, taking each other's measurements. Wow, you (bleep) it up. I had it. No, here. I got it. I'm gonna measure it for you, you (bleep) ding-a-ling. Janelle's still running hot after attacking Diandra for kissing her ex Darian. And Farrah's discovering her ripped-up posters, which was payback by Nurys for being kicked in the cooter. Oh, my God. Someone came up here and (bleep) up my signs. All right, so that's the (bleep) you started! Did she (bleep) do this? She might have did it, Farrah. Okay. Well, this is the best one. Did someone (bleep) up my-
- okay. All right. Farrah, let th■■óo■ Don't attack all of my amazing, amazing signs... that my housemates spent their time on making for me. Did someone have an idea to (bleep) bend all my signs? I (bleep) did! I did! I happily (bleep) did! I did, I did, I did, I did! Nurys did! She kicked me. She decided to put her hands on me, so I grabbed her free Farrah posters and I ripped them in half. Stop! No! You think I give a (bleep)? You think I give a (bleep)? No, no, no, no! Nurys, no! Diandra, Diandra! I know! If you wanna touch my stuff, your (bleep) gets a big (bleep) you down the toilet. Okay, touch my (bleep), bitch. Touch it, I dare you. ■■uch somebody else's (bleep). I did. You ugly-ass bitch! Oh, I'm ugly, bitch? How much plastic surgery have you had to fix your face and your body? I haven't done not one thing to my body or my face and I'm (bleep) gorgeous, so (bleep) my (bleep), bitch. You (bleep) disgusting bitch. Sure, sure, I'll take your (bleep). I'll take your (bleep) and put it in the toilet. If she touches my (bleep), I'm letting you guys know, I'ma beat this bitch's ass. Go ahead, Farrah. Put that (bleep) in the toilet. ?? sis. Here it goes. Here it (bleep) goes. Come on, sis. Here it goes. Put that (bleep) in the toilet. She (bleep) bent every one. She (bleep) your ex, sis! She bent! She bent! Disrespect me, disrespect my stuff, you will not be respected. And, um, karma's a bitch. Oh, (bleep)! She ripped her (bleep). Here we go. Here it goes. Here you go. Farrah's said she ripped it all up. If you argue with Farrah, she will kick you in the vagina and put your in the toilet and flush. That's some pussy-ass (bleep). I've never done something so crazy like that. It's bad enough that Farrah already kicked me in the vagina. Now she's grabbing my sneakers and she flushes them down the toilet. I could've touched her makeup that was there, or any of her personal belongings, and I didn't, because I have some type of class. Don't threaten me! Don't trip me! Don't (bleep) attack me! Since fighting is a big fat no-no, Janelle, Nurys, and Farrah are sent to hotels for the night with a warning. Talk (bleep), get hit, bitch. I'll see you tomorrow 'cause we always keepin' positive things. I love you. Mwah! Love you too. You guys think the, like, Farrah-Nurys situation c■c■is gonna continue today or-
- Oh, yeah, 100%. She's in a very precarious legal situation right now. Don't be coming around kicking anyone. But, like, I just got-
- like, this is childish. Okay, but if you got kicked in the cooter, what would you (bleep) do? I'ma kick you back in the cooter. Farrah went back, and then the security guard was there. She tripped over his feet and Farrah fell on her ass. Well, good thing she's got airbags back there. No, she-
- yeah. Did she bounce? It's not cool, man. Not cool a A>ú■■ her in the vagina for no reason, it's (bleep) up. It's what I'm saying, man. Honestly, because she done startp) since day one. Stirring up the pot, spreading rumors, calling me dirty (bleep). It's-

- How old are you? You're supposed to be... You're a mother. You're a mother. You're a mother. And you kicked a 22nd-year-old... in their vagina? 22-year-old. 22-
- 22nd. Oh, (bleep), whatever. 22, same (bleep). Yeah. 22, 22nd, I feel like it's the same thing. Hey, Janelle, like I'mand hate me,nywhere.ñd but if I ever get I'm gonna be s 're gonna be out. You've had problems with me since day one. And if your ex is really about you, let's see if he's ■■■■ ■■ou're ou this house.really about you, Before her ex came in here, she was painting this perfect picture. Mm-hmm. Like, wait till my ex come in here. I'ma show y'all. BuP speaking. How (bleep)... I would love for you to do that again. D■■■■■■■p■p■p■p■p■p■p■p■p■■ Oh, my God! What relationships are gonna get messed up today? Ahh! Please not me. I'ma say Morgan. I'm feeling it. Don't wield that (bleep). Chad has not been to the beach yet. It has to be Chad. (bleep)! Oh, my tits look so good! (bleep)! (bleep). So who's the last person? Please not me. Please. (bleep)! (bleep)! Why? Aw, damn it. Oh, my God. Just give me a little bit of time before another one comes. Can I just enjoy my peace? Bring up some men. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye, Morgan. d. Good luck. (Morgan) I have sos in this house. Like, Corey needs to go home. So I am worried. I feel like I have finally gotten to a good place with Jay, and I just-
- I don't want an ex to come and screw that up. Best-case scenario is that it's somebody else's ex, not mine, and I can just go back in the house and have fun with Chad, and not have anybody try interrupting my little honeymoon. How y'all feeling? Terrible. I'm clueless. You're clueless? For sure. I don't need a third, Romeo. I think me and Jay are on good terms finally. So Corey's not confusing things for you? Um, I just don't think it's gonna work between me and him. Nicole, how are things with you and Chad? We're good. I feel like you're gonna (bleep) it up though, so bring on the exes. By the end of this whole experience, some of you may find new love, rekindle with an old love, or just say (bleep) love. But the real question: Are you completely over your ex? It's time. No. Let's bring 'em out. (bleep). My ex coming in? Like, he doesn't need to be here. Just throw him back in the water. It's like, how much more can I take? I haven't cracked yet, but I feel like if an ex comes out of the water, I might reach my cracking point. [Music] Fun, everybody love a bomber, balls are great... [Music] Oh, that's not my ex! Yeah, that's not mine either. [Music] Go ahead, treat yourself... [Music][Music] My name is Monte, from Memphis, Tennessee, and you may know me from Big Brother: Over the Top. Being a southern gentleman is about treating a girl right. Opening the door for her, not cussing, acting a fool in front of her, but also smacking her ass as she walks through the door. Me and Morgan met in the Big Brother house. We dated for six months and then she decided she wants to move to L.A., so that kind of put a, you know, rut in the groove. I'm here to not only rekindle me and Morgan, but I know for a fact that Morgan is the one I wanna settle down with. And I'm at that point in my life where I'm ready. What's up, man? Doing good. What's going on, Monte? How do you like seeing Morgan over there? She looks pretty good, man. Stop. Yeah? Yeah. Why you here? Gotta get her back, man. Get her back? Yeah. He's trying to get you back! Great opportunity to take her back. 7/It is, ■ulifetime. Ugh! What happened between y'all two? I ended up moving to Los Angeles. It was too much of long distance got in the way and-
- So you left him hanging? It was too hard being so far apart. Seeing Monte brings back a lot of good memories. We don't really have any fights. You real flustered right now, like-
- Yeah, I'm flustered because I'm already living with two exes, and now you'retoss. But this connection seem genuineere. Even from the other ones, I'm feeling something. I think there is a genuine connection, but it's difficult because I got some issues back at the house. Don't play with Jay's feelings. I think that this is something between Jay and Morgan that can potentially ruin them. We got some things to figure out. I'm done. (bleep), (bleep)! No, Morgan! (bleep)! I dream of reaching my highest peak. I dream of expressing my inner-most passionq. I dream of robots that improve quality of life for humans. Umm, I dream of getting my Taco Bell delivered. Like, to my house. My dreams are unstoppa Unstoppable. My dreams are my fire. My dreams are my fire. My dreams are much more simple. And taco related. Am I in the right commercial? You gotta get out there! No one is going to hand it to you. That's what I'm saying. I'd rather stay in and have Taco Bell literally handed to me. Bring on the nay-sayers. Bring on the oS Tacos, the Crunch Wraps, a Chalupa. I don't know the meaning of failure. I don't know how to quit! I don't know what's going on! Woah! We're doing it guys. Achieving our dreams. Hey.

I've been good. It's been an experience, to say the least. Um, I'll go ahead and fill you in since Romeo told me I need to be honest. Yeah, shoot me straight. Don't lie to me. I feel like I'm an emotional wreck at all times in this house. It's like I'm the only person with three exes. Some people don't even have one ex and I'm dealing with th Like, I need to get Corey out of this house, and he's honestly pretty boring. Jay came in the house. I kind of rekindled things with him. Then Corey came in, so it was kind of like... Double whammy. ...a weird messy love triangle. But I thought I had it figured out till you walked up on the beach. Me and Monte had a great relationship before this. It didn't end badly. My family loves him. He's unfortunately the exact kind of guy that my dad would want me to marry, which is terrifying. You're my girl. Everything happens for a reason. So I really think, you know, Jay might be cool, but, you know, you gotta remember back to what we had too. We could rekindle that even better. I don't know who this Jay guy is, but, uh, he's gonna have to run for his money, 'cause, uh, Monte's coming. Give me a fair shot. That's all I ask. Okay. And I promise you, you'll reconsider. [Music] Let's go [Music] [Music] It's time to go, go, go, whoa [Music] [Music] It's time to go, go, go, let's go [Music] [Music] It's time to go, go, go, whoa [Music] [Music] Do you wanna, do you wanna go? [Music][Music] How you feeling though this morning? I'm cool. Like, the only thing I was actually, like, I was thinking about, like, last night, was, like, no one ever pulled her to the side and was like, Yo, I understand you're upset, but, like, how you're reacting, like, that's not okay. Depending on how Janelle comes back from the hotel, I'm hoping to see, uh, a new-
- a new person. Uh, the girl that I used to know. Here we go. Oh, (bleep)! Oh, Nicole! Sha! Chad, you're safe! So Nicole is back now and she doesn't have an ex, and I'm just like, Thank God I don't have to deal with that situation. So how did the guy look? Tell me. Does he look cute or whatever? I'm kind of scared for Jay. Why? He said he's here to get her back, and he's here for no other reason but to get her back. Oh, (bleep). Honestly, it should be called Morgan's Ex on the Beach. Like, how many exes do you have, girl? Like, just stop. All right, pull the chair, pull the chair, pull the chair. Hold on. Hey, Morgan. Take a seat. Let the man do the talking. Goddamn. This Monte character? (grunts) Damn! Ugh! Um, I will say this. All the boys you brought into the house are fine as (bleep). And-
- yes. So at least I have good taste. What are you here for? What are your intentions? What are my intentions? Are you here to h her? e ■; to rekindle that ? Hell yeah, man. I'm gonna rekindle the fire. What are you talking about? Okay, there we go. Oh, I'm gonna be just Mr. Tough Guy here to steal your girl. I'ma flirt with her in front of you and I'm gonna pretend like I'm not. Ha ha! I'm so cool! Clown. If things don't work out with Jay, are we allowed to take him into our relationship? y You're allowed to take him right now if you want. We can share. Oh, God, it's so sweet it's making me sick. Let's see if everyone else can be so levelheaded as Janelle, Farrah, and Nurys return from their stay at the hotel. Baby, baby, baby! Hey! elle. Hey! Whoo! What's up? So I've had a night to cool down, relax. Going in the house, for me, it is stressful because I'm dealing to with the factlax. that I really am, like, heartbroken for real. Diandra, can I talk to you? Yes. My main point to pull Diandra aside was to apologize to her and let her know that, hey, I know we've had our beefs in the past. Like, I know we personally don't care for each other, but the attack I made on her was not personal at all. So basically I just wanted to genuinely apologize for putting my hands on you. Like, my issues are with him. Like, I should conduct myself better just as a human being. You (bleep) kiss her?! You're gonna kiss her?! That is her ex. Oh, (bleep). Oh, you ain't tell me that. (bleep) you laughing, bitch?! Janelle! Janelle! Janelle! You (bleep)hole! So I apologize. I accept your apology. Um, I wasn't laughing at you. Like, I'm sorry. Like, when I get nervous, I'm like... But I literally-
- all I said, I looked back, like, this is crazy. And thankful that you came to apologize for putting your hands on me. No problem. Like, I meant it, 'cause I shouldn't be hitting people. I saw Janelle go up to Diandra, apologize for the whole thing, argument they had, and just literally broke down. And you know what? It takes a grown person to apologize and to admit that. I accept your apology. With me, if someone says sorry and they genuinely mean it, I will forgive you. Will I forget? No. I'm not stupid. I will definitely keep my eyes up open, but the minute you say sorry, all right, cte. I'ma do a handshake. Okay. We'll take it slow. Yes. Okay. Okay, thank you. All right. Now that Janelle and Diandra are on the same page, the house vibes seem to be in a good place. Maybe Farrah and Nurys can squash their beef too. Hello, house. Hey, Farrah. Hello. There's another one. So I'm back today and I'm going in the house and I'm just staying away from literally everything, everyone, and (bleep) them. Aww. Have a drink. I'm back. I'm back. I'm extremely happy that Nurys came back here. She did nothing wrong, but I understand as to why she had to leave. But I am genuinely upset that Farrah is still here. I'm gonna go ahead and leave it in the fate of the Lord and He will take care of that. Karma's a bitch. Good. So if I started talking to another girl, she'd probd out. Hey, can we talk? Hi, how are you? Sure. In private? Okay. I don't have to (bleep) apologize because I reacted like a normal human being, but better than a normal human being, 'cause a normal human being wouldn't have stopped (bleep) hitting her. Actually, a normal human being probably wouldn't kick someone in the vagina. I guess I just wanted to ask where your head was at yesterday. 'Cause I'm confused as to where all that animosity came from. All that, like-
- Okay, so I'm not confused. I'm very aware about what happened yesterday. When I come in to just hear what my friend's ex-boyfriend is saying, all I'm hearing is insults, um, from you about me, acting like you know me. I think-
- That all was brought up afterwards, so that's not what we're talking about. And continuation of that and that was-
- No, see, now you're trying to play victim. That's not what we're gonna do. So I'm not a victim. So I know you were just drinking. I'm not drinking. Okay. Okay. I'm wide awake. I have no patience for that. I apologized for you insulting me, you touching me. No. See, that's that-
- no, no. And I'm the bigger woman. Okay. Ha, okay. So I'm a real woman who knows what really happened. Okay, okay. You're out of control. Oh, my God. She's literally delusional. So stop. Get in control. This bitch is delusional, yo. Okay! except for herself and■d@■d@■d■d anybody in this house @■dYou're so embarras■d @■d■d■d w■d■d■d for trash like. This bitch is delusional, yo. Okay!

No, she's still lying and is a trash can. ■■I know I'm a bigger person. She's a whore.

It's Okayyyy Okurrrr [Music] I Like It [Music]ñ rat have we learned today? You want a Pepsi? I want a Pepsi. There you go. Okurrr. Aaahh. I've got to come up with my own catch phrase. Okayyy Welcome back. Before the break, the exes found out that they all had power for tomorrow's elimination, which is bad news for some of our misbehaved singles. You know, I tried so hard ■in this house totive and happy. 'Cause the last thing I wanted to do was come in this house and lose myself. And now I feel so lost. I know I don't have a say with the exes, but I want Corey out before Farrah. To me, he doesn't contribute anything. He has the personality of a (bleep) pet rock. And I feel like Jay's pissed with you just because, like-
- Why would he be pissed with me? I feel like he's pissed at you and her because-
- Not at me. She was kissing back. It wasn't like a-
- she said it was a snipe. It wasn't a snipe. It wasn't a snipe at all. When you're in this house, you kind of know that everything is gon reveal. Morgan's mind, if she gets evervo that evI mean, yeah,on reveal. she could focus on Jay. But honestly, like, what's she gonna look at? You know what I'm saying? It's hard for me to deal with the house and all this and me and you haven't gotten anything, like, resolved. Resolved. That (bleep) pisses me off 'cause it's like I'm over here dying inside. Darian knows that I do not allow a man to not be accountable for his wrongdoings and promise that he's not gonna do it again. Like, I need you to repent to me like I'm Jesus. When are you gonna fight for me here instead of involving yourself in (bleep) that don't (bleep) matter? When the (bleep) are you gonna fight for me? You don't even know what you want. When we originally broke up, she left me, literally. But now I feel like she kind of wants the best of both worlds. The onlyhat matters is me and if you can't strictly talkf about me and you right now,lds. then I will just go to bed. That's fine. Okay. Good-bye. Like, this is (bleep). That (bleep) again, man. Let it go. Are you good with us being done, yes or no? Of course not, Janelle. I feel like we're still up in the air. It could go left, it could go right. Yeah, we'll see, you know? It's elimination. At the end of the day, I'm my own man. I'm gonna make my own decisions. One light [Music] [Music]nd rair head up to the sky [Music] Aye-aye-aye-aye [Music][Music] We good now? That is so cute. Look at you and your cute breakfast. So you haven't got sausage in a while, so open up.Q That was a good one, huh? Mmm. Pretty good, huh? It's tricky. I really love it. I'm just gonna go eat up all my sausage. See you later. We both haven't got sausage in a long time. You know when you're hung over and you get ready and you don't even remember getting ready but you just kind of come to as you're looking good and you're like, Yeah? Yeah. It's nice. (Farrah) Murray? What's up? I am campaigning. If I stay... Mm-hmm. ...then you get something. I made a keep Farrah campaign book! And I have my speech ready for elimination tonigh I made a keep Farrah campaign book! Pretend I'm Romeo. Romeo, this is my keep Farrah campaign. Okay? 'Kay. And if I stay, this is what the house will get because I am staying. I pledge to throw a yacht party for Jozea. Okay. A live-in maid. Yes. Jacuzzi cleaner, bubblier, and more mimosas for Chad and Nicole. Whoo! Look, I care about my housemates. Well, and if you just voted me out, then that's okay, I'm on strike. And I am ready with my pantsuit and all. What's up, gangsta? What's going on? Talk to me. I'm just, like, drained emotionally. I just didn't wanna get to that point yesterday and I did, and now I feel like I, like, can't be myself. What do you want with us? t know. You don't trust me anymore. It's like-
- You honestly believe that I don't trust you at all? I don't know. I just wish you were more honest with me. I would prefer the truth. Not 10%, 50%, 90%. Give me the whole damn thing. Just wanna say sorry. I didn't wanna put you through all this. ■■■Do I still want affection and touch her all the time and hug her and (bleep)? Hell yeah. So I'll give her a shot. I'll give her a chance again. But... I still care about you. It's like, are you happier with me here? Yeah, what are they gonna do? Send me a new blond? We know where Jay stands, but the rest of the exes are still making up their minds. I just wanna know where-
- what-
- like, where your heads are at and why you would-
- you know, like, who you guys wanna vote out and, like, why? The only singles on the chopping block are Corey and Farrah. Corey because Morgan wants him out. She doesn't feel that she can continue her relationship ay while he's here. And Farrah is on the chopping block. It's 'cause she kicked my girl in the vagina and she needs to (bleep) off. Morgan's like, Someone help me, please. But she's not actually physically getting attacked, and it's bull(bleep). You know I get your side, and I feel so bad for Morgan that she's gotten bull(bleep) after bull(bleep) after bull(bleep). But to be honest, she did not get this physically attacked. That's so (bleep) up that any of you guys are even deciding for even the slightest (bleep) bit. Seriously? I don't understand why people wanna get Corey out. Corey hasn't done anything. Farrcrazy, sional bitch. She's the one that's the problem. We're supposed to be exesng and we're supposed to stick together, correct? Correct, and none of you guys had my back. That's the biggest bull(bleep) ever. Even though I know she hurt you, and, like, Farrah did do things wrong, everyone's done a couple things wrong, and at this point, like, it's like we're not all gonna come to one. I think we should all just vote what we think at this point. So I'm just gonna go ahead and crush Farrah just because I feel like Farrah, ifgonna respect her, she'll respect you right back. She treats all of us pretty good other than the people that she doesn't like, which is everyone for the most part. I shouldn't have to (bleep)-
- this should be easy. It shouldn't even be a question. I totally understand why you want her out. I wish y'all would just talk it out. But you don't even wanna talk to me, so... I thought she did try to talk to her. She did try to talk to Farrah, and Farrah just blew-
- I already know I'm the bigger person. I don't need to. I'm not going up to the bitch again. And yes, I will call her a bitch 'cause she's a bitch. Like, I really don't care. It sucks to see that people don't have my back. I haven't done anything to deserve that. Before we start 
- how much is my tax prep going to cost? I can't really say that until the end. (Lisa) [off-screen] Wait, no. H&R Block has upfront, transparent pricing so you know the price before you begin. So, it can work like that. Yup! Oh, so you want transparency. Oh, um I could give you a ballpark... Ummm, hmmmm. That's not a price. (Lisa VO) [Music] Know the price before you begin. With new upfront transparent pricing at H&R Block. In-person or online. Block has your back. You can't put a price on love. But if you did, it'd cost the exact same as a Reese's. Turns out love's kinda inexpensive. Not Sorry. Reese's. This is Game Fuel. It's domination in a can. b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷b÷ Ahh.

Now the singa taste of their own medicine. One of you mother(bleep) is going home. You're gone, bitch. Well, I'm just gonna go ahead and crush Farrah just because I'm cool with her and I'm just gonna go ahead and not even deal with the whole Corey thing ■ withad blood ct him.(sighs) Tonight, I am cutting Corey because I think that he came here with a mission to stir up feelings with Morgan. I think that's kind of passed, so... Honestly, I think that people are, like, trying to protect Morgan, but she's, like, you know, a little bitter at this point, I think, and she, like, wants to get me out now. I'm shocked that I would even be up to be eliminated, really. But as I am, I'm ready to defend myself. I'm here to stay. What up? What up, everybody? Looking good. Now, before we get started, I want to say something. ■■ííTóTí There's any more confrontations that get physical,a you will be sent home. We're all about love here, baby. All right, let's get down to business. Singles, we're gon' do things a little bit differently tonight. Earlier today, the exes voted for which single they wanted to crush or cut. ngle tived the most cut Crush votes, like y'all know, cancels out cut votes. And if the vote results in a tie, the power will revert to the remaining singles. Somemay find new■ rekindle w, or just say (bleep) love. By the end of your time here, we're gonna put you through the ultimate test. I've tried real hard to campaign to get Corey out of this house. Be able to ans!■&■&■&S■&& Before we get to these votes, banybody wanna say anything? I would like to make a speech. Wow. Okay. (Romeospeech. Yeah. So it's a keep Farrah campaign. But does she forget we already voted? If I, Farrah, am here to stay, I pledge unlimited grocery shopping, live-in maid. Also lots more toilet paper, cleaner, and air spray. We gotta wrap it up in a second. Okay, all right. All who voted for me to be eliminated will be on trash duty and be shunned. ■■■a##■A■■■■ Honestly, in my heart of hearts, I don't want either Farrah or Corey to go. Farrah, we gotta take a seat right there. Thank you. All right. Whoo! Thank you. So funny. So funny. All right, all right, we gon' get back to it. Let's get started. Jozea. You already know what it is. You good. Nothing's in there. No cut or no crush. Yes. You are safe, Jozea. Maya, Malcolm, Nicole, Cheyenne, Chad... you don't have nothing in your pineapple. Which means you are safe. We still got a lot of chips still out there. With that being said, Morgan, please step up to your pineapple. So how would you like the vo tonight? I honestly would like Corey to go home. It's nothing against him, but I have three exes in the house. Three is enough. Are you ready? Yeah. You got a chip. But it's a crush. Duh. (appla Have a seat.

I am pissed because Darian was going to fully take the credit for that crush, but instead ting it on someone that you barely even know, it's like, put it towards me to show me that, like, you care. Corey, please step up to your pineapple. If I had to guess, you got some chips in there. Yeah. Let's get to it. First chip, cut. Got another chip... which is a cut. You have two cut votes, which means you're on the hot seat. Take a seat. I might be going home because of, like, her messiness, it's jusir to me that I would have to potentially go home.

You think you have any crush votes, any cut votes? I mean, I hope I have some crush votes. All right, you ready to get to it? Yeah. First one. I'm so over Farrah! You're giving everybody a hard time.
