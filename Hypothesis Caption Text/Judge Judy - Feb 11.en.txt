>> Judge Judy: I don't care! [ Laughter ] I'm mildly obsessed with numbers. So, I started with the stats regarding my moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Like how HUMIRA has been prescribed to over 300,000 patients. And how many patients saw clear or almost clear skin in just 4 months 
- the kind of clearance that can last. HUMIRA targets and blocks a specific source of inflammation that contributes to symptoms. Numbers are great. And seeing clearer skin is pretty awesome, too. That's what I call a Body of Proof. <i> HUMIRA can lower your</i> <i> ability to fight infections.</i> <i> Serious and sometimes</i> <i> fatal infections, including</i> <i> tuberculosis, and cancers,</i> <i> including lymphoma,</i> <i> have happened, as</i> <i> have blood, liver, and</i> <i> nervous system problems,</i> <i> serious allergic reactions,</i> <i>and new or worsening</i> <i> heart failure.</i> <i> Tell your doctor if you've</i> <i> been to areas where certain</i> <i> fungal infections are</i> <i> common and if you've had</i> <i> TB, hepatitis B,</i> <i> are prone to infections,</i> <i> or have flu-like</i> <i> symptoms or sores.</i> <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i> <i> if you have an infection.</i> Want more proof?
