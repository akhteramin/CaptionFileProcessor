 BOMANI: 9:20 P.M. IS THE TIP
 TIME FOR THE GAME.
 PABLO: IT WAS 9:20?
 THEY COULDN'T GIVE US NINE
 FLAT?
 BOMANI: THEY COULD NOT.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DECIDED

 PABLO: IS IT THE WEST COAST
 BENEFITING HERE?
 BOMANI: I GUESS.
 ARE THEY FLYING HOME TO GO TO
 SLEEP?
 PABLO: THEY HAVE WARM WEATHER,
 PALM TREES AND EARLY GAMES.
 THEY DON'T NEED THIS.
 WITH THESE TEAMS?
 BOMANI: GOING TO BE A STRUGGLE.
 PABLO: YOU HAVE THE FIRST CARD.
 BOMANI: I DO HAVE THE FIRST
 CARD.
 IT IS THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
 GAME.
 THEY HAVE IT GAMMONS AFTER
 BRUCE PEARL'S SQUAD LOST IN
 CONTROVERSY.
 1.5 SECONDS LEFT.
 KYLE GUY PUT UP A MISSED
 THREE-POINTER A FOUL WAS
 CALLED.
 THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT ABOUT
 THIS.
 WE GOT THIS RIGHT HERE.
 PABLO: 1.5 SECONDS.
 BOMANI: PEOPLE TRYING TO SAY
 THAT WASN'T A FOUL.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 THE GUY JUMPED.
 HOW WAS THAT A FOUL?
 PABLO: VERTICAL IS NOT JUST A
 ROY HIBBERT RELATED CONCEPT.
 THIS IS KIND OF WHAT THE RULE
 IS THERE FOR.
 BOMANI: WHAT SYMPATHY DO YOU
 HAVE FOR AUBURN IN ALL OF THIS?
 PABLO: I DON'T HAVE MUCH.
 I GET IT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE
 THE GAME END THAT WAY.
 WE CONTE WANT TO SEE THE
 NATIONAL GAME PARTICIPANT
 DECIDED BY THREE FREE-THROWS,
 WHICH KYLE SANK COOLEY.
 BUT THE OTHER THING IS LET'S
 JUST NET ENFORCE THE RULES, AND
 THE RULES ARE TO BE ENFORCED
 WHEN THE REFS CALL IT IN THAT
 WAY.
 BOMANI: AUBURN MANAGED TO DO
 WHAT I THOUGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE,
 WHICH IS TO BLOW A FOUR-POINT
 LEAD TO VIRGINIA WITH SEVEN
 SECONDS LEFT.
 A FOUR-POINT LEAD AGAINST THAT
 TEAM IS BASICALLY
 INSURMOUNTABLE BECAUSE IT TAKES
 THEM SO LONG TO GET ANYTHING
 GOING ON OFFENSE.
 WE SAW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
 WITH SYRACUSE PUT THE PRESS ON,
 AND THOSE DUDES COULDN'T MAKE
 RUNNING LAY-UPS BECAUSE THEY
 WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE IDEA OF
 MOVING FAST.
 THIS FALLS ON BRUCE PEARL
 BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY USED
 THOSE FOULS LATE.
 IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE TRYING
 TO USE UP THEIR FOULS TO GIVE
 RATHER THAN USE THEM IN THE
 PLACE THEY HAD TO.
 THAT WAS A COACHING DISASTER.
 PABLO: THE GREAT SYMPATHY I
 HAVE FOR THEM WAS IN THAT
 MISSED DOUBLE DRIBBLE CALL.
 THAT WAS EGREGIOUS AND BEFORE
 THE THREE-POINTER.
 BOMANI: PEOPLE'S DEFENSE FOR IT
 IS WHEN YOU DIDN'T SEE IT ON
 TV.
 LET ME SHOW YOU WHO COMES INTO
 THE SHOT RIGHT THERE.
 RIGHT THERE, THE REF.
 UNLESS HE SNUCK DOWN FROM FOOT
 LOOKER, HE IS THE ONE WHO IS
 SUPPOSED TO SEE THAT.
 PABLO: THE REASON WHY I WANTED
 THAT CALLED IS WHAT DO WE HAVE
 TONIGHT?
 WE HAVE VIRGINIA AND TEXAS
 TECH.
 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STYLES OF
 FIGHTS, WE SAY IT IS THE
 UNSTOPPABLE FORCE VERSUS THE
 IMMOVABLE ONLY.
 BOMANI: TEXAS TECH, WHICH HAS
 POSSIBLY THE BEST DEFENSE WE
 HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 20 YEARS,
 OFFENSIVELY I THINK THEY ARE
 GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF A BAD
 R57.
 THEY MOVE THE BALL.
 THEY ARE NOT A BAD TEAM TO
 WATCH.
 THEY HAVE SOME ATHLETIC GUYS
 OUT THERE.
 BUT IF YOU THINK THEY PLAY
 SLOW.
 THEY PLAY SEVEN POSSESSIONS A
 GAME FASTER THAN VIRGINIA.
 VIRGINIA IS THE LITERALLY
 SLOWEST TEAM IN AMERICA.
 SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE
 GREAT DEFENSE OF TEXAS TECH
 AGAINST AN OFFENSE THAT KIND OF
 HELPS A DEFENSE BECAUSE THERIOT
 NOT TRYING TO SCORE THAT MANY
 POINTS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 PABLO: YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOVE
 THE NBA TO GET THE ARGUMENT I
 AM ABOUT TO MAKE, BUT THIS IS
 THE STYLE OF MODERN BASKETBALL.
 BOMANI: WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO
 LONG TO GET ACROSS HALF-COURT?
 PABLO: I RECENT THIS ASPECT OF
 THE GAME.
 TAKING OUR TIME.

 THEY ARE GOING TO END UP
 TONIGHT WITH 60 OR SO
 POSSESSIONS TOTAL BECAUSE THEY
 ARE GOING TO TRAIN SECONDS OFF
 EVERY POSSIBLE SHOT CLOCK.
 THE BEST ADVERTISING FOR THIS
 GAME IS PREMISED IN THE THEORY
 THAT IT WILL BE CLOSE.
 LIKE IT WILL COME DOWN TO THE
 LAST MINUTE, IT WILL JUST BE A
 LOW-SCORING SLOW GAME.
 BOMANI: TO BE FAIR TO VIRGINIA,
 THEY HAVE HAD TWO GOOD FINISHES
 IN THE LAST TWO GAMES.
 SO TUNE IN AROUND 11:45.
 PABLO: THE NEXT NAME IS KYLE
 KORVER.
 HE WROTE ABOUT RACISM AND WHITE
 PRIVILEGE.
 HE WROTE I KNOW AS A WHITE MAN
 I HAVE TO HOLD MY FELLOW WHITE
 MEN ACCOUNTABLE.
 WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE,
 INTERESTING THING KORVER SAID
 IN ALL OF THIS?
 BOMANI: I THOUGHT IT WAS
 THOUGHTFUL.
 THERE IS A CERTAIN IRONY IN
 WHAT MAKES THIS IMPRESSIVE.
 WHAT MAKES THIS IMPRESSIVE IS
 IT IS DONE BY A PERSON WHO
 POSSESSES WHITE PRIVILEGE.
 WE ARE LISTENING TO KYLE KORVER
 SAY THINGS THAT A LOT OF OTHER
 PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO SAY, BUT HE
 IS SAYING IT.
 I THOUGHT THE WAY HE SAID IT
 STOOD OUT.
 THE OTHER THING THAT STOOD OUT
 WAS HE LOW KEY SAID WE SHUT THE
 DOOR IN THE LOCKER ROOM AND
 SAID A THESE OTHER GUYS WHO
 PLAYED IN UTAH, WHEN THEY
 DIDN'T PLAY IN UTAH, THEY HATED
 PLAYING IN UTAH.
 PABLO: HE TALKED ABOUT BEING
 TEAMMATES WITH THABO SEFOLOSHA,
 ONE OF THE GUYS THEY WERE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THABO
 SEFOLOSHA AND WHEN HE HAD HIS
 INCIDENT WITH POLICE, THE
 POLICE BRUTALITY CASE IN NEW
 YORK, KORVER SAID HE THOUGHT IF
 IT WAS NOT HIM OUT THERE, HE
 WOULD NOT HAVE BEHAVED THAT
 WAY, THAT THIS WAS A THABO
 SEFOLOSHA INCIDENT.
 THAT IS A LEVEL OF ADMISSION
 THAT HE DID NOT HAVE TO GIVE.
 PABLO: THIS GUY THAT SPEAKS ALL
 THESE LANGUAGES, GOT JAMMED UP
 BY THE COMES, AND MY FIRST
 THOUGHT WAS I WONDER WHERE HE
 DID.
 TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PART, YOU
 FIGURE STUFF OUT.
 THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL THING
 ABOUT THE NBA.
 IT TOOK KYLE KORVER A LITTLE
 LONGER TO FIGURE THIS OUT, BUT
 IN THE NBA THERE SEEMS TO BE A
 CULTURAL EXCHANGE THAT TAKES
 PLACE THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN
 OTHER AMERICAN SPORTS IN THAT
 THERE IS A LEVEL OF DISCOURSE
 THAT HAPPENS AMONG THE PLAYERS
 THAT WE ARE NOT HEARING NEARLY
 AS MUCH SAY COMING OUT OF THE
 NFL WHEN IT COMES TO THESE
 MATTERS.
 FOR KORVER TO SAY THESE THINGS
 THE WAY HE DID, AND TO SAY IT
 TO A BROADER AUDIENCE AND
 SAYING THESE ARE THE THINGS WE
 NEED TO DO.
 THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS
 ARTICLE, ARE THEY GOING TO
 RE-TWEET IT, OR THEY ACTUALLY
 GOING TO LIVE THE STUFF HE
 SAID.
 I SAW A LOT OF THIS MOVED ME
 AND ME ME THINK, BUT WHAT WILL
 IT MAKE YOU DO?
 PABLO: THIS IS THE WAY AMERICAN
 DISCOURSE WORKS.
 WE HAVE A GUY LIKE ASHTON KU
 CHER SAYING THIS.
 THIS HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED BY
 BLACK PEOPLE FOR A VERY LONG
 TIME.
 THERE IS A LOT WITHOUT ANY OF
 THE EXIT RAMPS SO WE COULD
 FOCUS ON THE MENTAL.
 SPEAKING OF THE MESSAGE, THERE
 WAS A CONVERSATION WITH HIS
 FELLOW PLAYERS.
 ROLL THE VIDEO.
 WE HAVE THEM CHIMING IN THAN
 OUGHT JAZZ ORGANIZATION.
 IF THEY CAN CREATE THE
 THING, SHE CAN HOP ON THE PHONE
 WITH 29 OTHER OWNERS AND OTHER
 SPORTS OWNERS AND TRY TO HOLD
 THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
 I THINK IT IS UP TO THE PLAYERS
 TO HOLD THE ORGANIZATION
 ACCOUNTABLE.
 BOMANI: HE IS ON TO SOMETHING
 THERE IN THE SENSE THAT --
 AGAIN WHAT THIS KYLE KORVER
 THINGS DEMONSTRATES IS SOME
 PEOPLE MIGHT LISTEN TO ME.
 MORE PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO KYLE
 KORVER, AND A HELL OF A LOT
 MORE PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO THIS
 RICH OWNER.
 IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE
 MESSAGE CHANGE, IT PROBABLY HAS
 TO COME FROM THE PEOPLE WHO
 HAVE THE REAL POWER.
 WAR THEY GOING TO DO BECAUSE
 THEY ARE TOO AFRAID OF
 OFFENDING THE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE
 THEM ACT BETTER.
 .STEP ONE IS CLARITY ON THE
 ISSUE.
 BOMANI: NEXT NAME IS PAUL
 PIERCE.
 HE SAID THIS WEEKEND ON INSIDE
 COUNTDOWN THAT HE HAD A BETTER
 CAREER THAN DWYANE WADE.
 BO
 [LAUGHTER]
 NBA FINALS MLB.
 YOU HAVE HIM IN CAREER POINTS.
 HE HAS MORE PLAYOFF POINTS.

 PAUL, WHO IS THE BETTER NBA
 PLAYER?
 THAT IS EASY.
 I CAN SAY THAT OFF THE BAT.
 THAT IS ME.
 IF YOU GIVE ME LEBRON, WE GOT
 THAT LATE.
 EARLY IN MY CAREER, IF YOU GIVE
 ME THESE GUYS EARLY IN MY
 CAREER --
 WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
 PERFECT TIME FOR YOU?
 WHEN I AM 24 YEARS OLD, GIVE
 ME SHAQ.
 GIVE ME LEBRON AND BOSH.
 I WOULD BE SITTING ON FIVE OR
 SIX CHAMPIONSHIPS EASY.
 PABLO: THIS WAS DELUSION
 WRAPPED IN SINCERITY, WRAPPED
 IN IRONY, BECAUSE THEY SET UP
 PAUL PIERCE TO GIVE THAT TAKE.
 BUT PAUL PIERCE LOVED GIVING
 THAT TAKE BECAUSE HE BELIEVES
 THAT TAKE.
 BOMANI: WHO SET PAUL PIERCE UP?
 LIKE HE JUST SHOWED UP OUT OF
 THE CAR AND LANDED ON A
 TELEVISION SET AND THEY WERE
 LIKE THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING
 TO TALK ABOUT.
 HE KNEW DAMN WELL WHAT THEY
 WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BEFORE
 THEY GOT UP THERE, AND HE MEANT
 EVERY WORD.
 PAUL PIERCE IS AN ALL-TIME
 GREAT PLAYER.
 WHEN HE SAYS LOOK AT WHAT
 NECESSARY GAVE ME EARLY IN MY
 CAREER, I PRESUME HE IS TALKING
 ABOUT GUYS LIKE ANTOINE WALKER.
 YOU KNOW WHO THE SECOND LEADING
 SCORER WHEN THE HEAT WON THE
 CHAMPIONSHIP, IN THE NBA
 FINALS, THE LEADING SCORER WAS
 ANTOINE WALKER.
 SHAQ SCORED ALL OF 13.POINTS A
 GAME IN THAT SERIES.
 COME ON, MAN.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 PABLO: DOES IT SEEM TO BE ABOUT
 THE HEAT AND THE CELTICS?
 THE HEAT CAME ALONG, AND THEY
 WON THE ARMS RACE.
 THEY BLEW THE CELTICS OUT OF
 THE WATER.
 BEFORE PAUL PIERCE USED TO BE
 ABLE TO LEAN ON THE IDEA, THE
 TSUNAMIER TEAM WAS SOMETHING,
 BUT THEY GOT OUTGUNNED.
 NOW EACH THE HEAT LOOK MINOR
 AFTER WHAT THE WARRIORS ARE
 DOING.
 WHY IS PAUL PIERCE SAYING I AM
 SO GREAT?
 BOMANI: IF YOU ASK PAUL PIERCE
 WHO IS BETTER ME OR LAKE, HE
 COULD COME BACK AND SAY IF YOU
 GIVE ME OTHERS I WNBA HERE.
 COMING UP, ANTONIO BROWN

 BOMANI: LAST NIGHT IN THE
 WOMEN'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
 GAME, ARIKE OGUNBOWALE, I HATE
 WHEN I STRUGGLED WITH NAMES,
 BUT SHE TRIED TO MAKE THE FIRST
 ONE, MISSED IT, TRIED TO MISS
 THE SECOND ONE, MADE IT.
 PABLO: THE GAME ENDS LIKE THAT.
 ONE OF THE MOST DECORATED
 CLUTCH SHOOTERS EVER HAS AN
 EXIT THAT LEADS TO HARD BREAK.
 BOMANI: DON'T GET THIS TWISTED.
 THE SHOT THEY MADE LAST YEAR
 STILL MATTERS.
 PABLO: FIRST QUOTE.
 A -AVENATTI LIST ADD DROP BOX
 THAT INCLUDED NAMES WILLIAMSON
 AND BOL.
 BOMANI:, I ASK YOU WHY IS THIS
 DROP BOX NOT MAKING A BIGGER
 SPLASH?
 BOMANI: I SAID THAT AVENATTI
 WAS ON A SLOW WALK TO ZION
 WILLIAMSON.
 THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT
 COULD MAKE-A-WISH A SPLASH OUT
 OF THIS.
 HE GOT THERE.
 I WAS WONDERING IF HE WAS
 HOPING DUKE WOULD BE IN THE
 FINAL FOUR.
 THIS DUDE IS OUT HERE WITH
 DOCUMENTS.
 NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE.
 PABLO: HE HAS DOCUMENTS WITH
 NAMES OF PLAYERS ON THEM.
 IN PAST CASES WHEN IT COMES TO
 GOVERNMENT STUFF, THEY HAVE
 ALWAYS REDACTED THOSE NAMES.
 NOW WE HAVE ALLEGED PROOF WITH
 A CLARITY WE DON'T OFTEN AGAIN
 THAT MAKES ME WONDER.
 IS THIS GUY JOSE CANSECO FOR
 COLLEGE BASKETBALL?
 IS HE THE GUY SO EASILY
 DISCREDITABLE, BUT GENERALLY
 CORRECT?
 BOMANI: THING IS JOSE CANSECO
 DIDN'T HAVE PAPERWORK.
 RICK PITINO LOST HIS JOB BEHIND
 STUFF LIKE THIS.
 IN THE END WHERE WE ARE IS
 PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LOOK INTO
 THIS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THEY
 LIKE THE DUDE ZION.
 IF YOUR ATTITUDE IS SO LAISSEZ
 FAIRE ABOUT WHAT AVENATTI IS
 BRINGING, YOU NEED TO KEEP THAT
 ENERGY ALL TIME.
 THE NEXT TIME THE NCAA WANTS TO
 JACK A KID UP OR OTHERS, YOU
 NEED TO BE STANDING UP AND
 SAYING HOW RIDICULOUS THIS IS.
 WHAT ANNOYS ME IS SOME OF US
 FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN STANDING ON
 TABLES SCREAMING HOW UNFAIR
 THIS IS, ABOUT HOW THE PLAYERS
 ARE BEING OSTRACIZED AND
 MISTREATED BECAUSE OF ALL THIS.
 NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU DON'T
 CARE?
 THEN START CARING ABOUT THE
 PART THAT MATTERS, WHICH IS
 ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THESE KIDS
 BROKE.
 PABLO: IF YOU ESTABLISH A
 CONSENSUS THIS IS ACTUALLY
 GOING ON WITH HIGH LEVEL
 PLAYERS EVERYWHERE, THEN
 THEORETICALLY THE ARGUMENT
 BECOMES HARDER TO MAKE WHEN YOU
 ARE TRYING TO ARGUE AGAINST
 PAYING PLAYERS.
 THEY ARE ALREADY BEING PAID.
 DO YOU WANT TO LET THE BACK
 MARKET DO THE JOB?
 BOMANI: PEOPLE THOUGH THINK
 PLAYERS SHOULD BE PAID LIVE IN
 A BUBBLE AND DON'T REALIZE THE
 MAJORITY OPINION REMAINS THAT
 THEY SHOULD NOT BE PAID.
 QUOTE, EMOTION.
 FUMBLED THE POSTSEASON IN THE
 BIGGEST GAME OF THE YEAR.
 TWEETED ANTONIO BROWN IN
 RESPONSE TO A FAN'S TWEET
 SAYING JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER WAS
 THE STEELERS' MOST VALUABLE
 PLAYER IN 2018.
 JUJU THEN TWEETED THIS ABOUT
 A.B.
 ALL I EVER DID WAS SHOW THAT
 MAN LOVE AND RESPECT FROM THE
 MOMENT I GOT TO THE LEAGUE.
 I WAS GENUINELY HAPPY FOR HIM
 TOO WHEN HE GOT TRADED TO
 OAKLAND WITH A BIG CONTRACT.
 NOW HE IS TAKING SHOTS AT ME ON
 SOCIAL MEDIA?
 PABLO, WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON
 HERE?
 PABLO: I GUESS I AM WITH JUJU
 SMITH-SCHUSTER BECAUSE THE
 START WAS SOMETHING ELSE.
 THEY WERE TARIK BACKGROUND
 RANDOM PITTSBURGH STUFF.
 THEN ANTONIO GETS ON THERE WITH
 JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER.
 JUJU WAS NOT INVOLVED, AND
 BROWN SAW THAT AND SAID THIS
 RESONATES WITH ME BECAUSE I
 RECENT THIS MAN FOR BASICALLY
 HAVING A BETTER REPUTATION THAN
 ME DESPITE MAKING MORE MISTAKES
 ON THE FIELD.
 THUS WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE
 TODAY.
 BOMANI: I AM ON NOBODY'S SIDE.
 I AM ON THE SIDE OF THE AMISH,
 PEOPLE WHO EXISTED PRIOR TO THE
 TECHNOLOGY.
 SOMETIMES I WANT TO GO AMISH,
 IF WE ARE, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
 WITH THIS.
 THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO SAY BACK
 ON THIS ON THE INTERNET.
 EITHER CALL HIM AND TALK TO HIM
 OR DON'T.
 YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
 WHAT THIS DUDE INTHS BECAUSE
 HIS OPINION IS CLEARLY ERRATIC.
 FOR ANTONIO BROWN, HOW CAN I BE
 ON HIS SIDE ON THIS MATTER,
 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE SAY
 THAT DUDE DROPPED THE BALL IN
 THE POSTSEASON.
 BRUH, YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP AT ALL
 IN WEEK 17.
 WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ANY OF
 THIS?
 ARE
 PABLO: AND HE STARTED THE DAY
 BY SAYING KEEP YOUR EMOTIONS
 OFF THE INTERNET.
 AND JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER HITS
 HIM WITH THAT ON TWITTER.
 DON'T ARGUE WITH A MILLENNIAL
 WHOSE DOG HAS AN AGENT.
 BOMANI: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DID
 ME LIKE THAT.
 WHO CARES WHY HE DID YOU LIKE
 THAT?
 PABLO: LAST QUOTE.
 THE PERSON THAT LOSES IS THE
 PLAYER.
 SAID NICK SABAN ABOUT ANYONE
 BUT THE TOP RANKED PLAYERS
 LEAVING EARLY FOR THE NFL.
 LET'S WATCH.
 I THINK IN THE LAST FIVE
 YEARS, NOT COUNTING THIS YEAR,
 THERE HAVE BEEN 380 PLAYERS GO
 OUT AERIAL FOR THE DRAFT, AND
 25% OF THOSE GUYS DIDN'T GET
 DRAFTED.
 ANOTHER 25% WEREN'T ON A TEAM
 IN THREE YEARS.
 THAT MEANS 50% OF THE GUYS WHO
 WENT OUT EARLY FOR THE DRAFT
 HAD FAILED CAREERS.
 NOW YOU HAVE GUYS THAT HAVE NO
 DRAFT GRADES, SEVENTH ROUND
 GRAPES, FREE AGENT PHRASE,
 FIFTH ROUND GRADES GOING OUT TO
 THE DRAFT.
 PERSON THAT LOSES IS THE
 PLAYER.
 LOOK, I AM 100% NFL.
 I AM 100% GUYS HAVING CAREERS.
 BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE SMART
 ABOUT THE BITS DECISIONS THEY
 MAKE RELATIVE TO THE NFL
 BECAUSE IT IS ALL BUSINESS.
 PABLO: BO, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
 SABAN THERE?
 BOMANI: HE IS NOT WRONG
 NECESSARILY.
 THIS DEPENDS ON POSITION.
 IF YOU ARE A RUNNING BACK, YOU
 SHOULD GO OUT THERE OR NOT, IT
 IS JUST TOO RISKY.
 TAKING INTO ACONTI THESE GUYS
 COMING OUT OF S.E.C. SCHOOLS,
 THEIR MEDICALS ARE AWFUL WHEN
 THEY GET TO THE LEAVE.
 YOU CAN'T TAKE THOSE HITS FROM
 FREE.
 HE IS COMING FROM A PERSPECTIVE
 WHERE HE IS TRYING TO MAXIMIZE
 GUYS' LONG-TERM EARNINGS.
 MY QUESTION IS HOW MANY OF THEM
 NEED MONEY ON THE SHORT TERM?
 THE IDEA OF LEAVING COLLEGE TO
 GO GET A JOB, PEOPLE DO THIS
 ALL TIME.
 FOOTBALL PLAYERS AREN'T
 NECESSARILY DIFFERENT.
 PABLO: RONNIE HARRISON, A SABAN
 FORMER PLAYER, KILLED HIM ON
 TWITTER.
 KEEP MY NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
 WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS THE
 COSTS.
 THE LACK OF INCOME, MAYBE
 SOMETHING HAPPENS TO MY
 POSITION OR THE TEAM WITH DRAFT
 ME.
 IT IS NOT ALL THAT SIMPLE.
 BOMANI: IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT
 HE DID NOTE IF YOU ARE A SECOND
 OR THIRD ROUND PICK AND THERE
 IS NO CHANCE YOUR GRADE IS
 GOING TO GO UP, YOU MAY AS WELL
 GO.
 COMING UP NEXT, WHO IS THE MOST
 FEARED PLAYER IN THE NBA?
 WHO IS FEELING CRAFTY?

 WAIT A MINUTE.

 TOO.
 SO AM I.
 WHY NOT?
 BOMANI: DO PEOPLE WHO WATCH
 WRESTLING GET SENSITIVE WHEN
 YOU JOKE ABOUT THAT STUFF?
 THEY DO BECAUSE IT IS STILL
 KIND OF REAL TO THEM.
 BOMANI: DID YOUR FRIENDS WHO
 WATCH WRESTLING GO TO HARVARD
 TOO?
 THEY DID.
 A LOT OF TUA WRITINGS VERY
 WISELY SPENT.
 TODAY ET CETERA NUMBER, 43.8%,
 THE PERCENTAGE WHO SAID JAMES
 JOHNSON.
 THE KUO WAS WHO DON'T YOU WANT
 TO FIGHT?
 IS JAMES JOHNSON THE PERSON YOU
 WOULD LEAST WANT TO FIGHT?
 BOMANI: NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST.
 HE IS TRAINED IN THE HI-YAH
 YARDS.
 HIS DAD AND MOM KNOW HI-YAH.
 HE IS WELL TRAINED AND 6'9" ON
 TOP OF.
 THAT YOU DON'T WANT THOSE
 PROBLEMS.
 THE PROBLEM IS YOU ARE NOT
 GOING TO FIND CLIPS OF JAMES
 JOHNSON FIGHTING SOMEBODY IN
 THE NBA BECAUSE HE WOULD KILL
 SOMEBODY IF HE DID, AND
 APPARENTLY THE STREETS NOW.
 PABLO: NUMBER TWO WAS STEVEN
 ADAMS, 19.8%.
 WE HAVE VIDEO OF HIM BEING
 IMMOVABLE.
 BOMANI: THE QUESTION WAS WHO
 DON'T YOU WANT TO FIGHT, NOT
 WHO IS THE TOUGHEST.
 I THINK ADAMS GOT WHO TOUGH
 TEST.
 CHARLES OAKLEY AND RON ARTEST
 ARE STILL GETTING STROTES.
 CHARLES OAKLEY GOT AS MANY
 VOTES AS BOBBY PORTIS.
 WHO DID HE VOTE FOR, MIROTIC,
 WHO DID HE VOTE FOR?
 PABLO: I THINK WE KNOW THE
 ANSWER.
 IS THAT VINCE CARTER HAVING
 PTSZ?
 BOMANI: WHO IS LEFT IN THE
 LEAGUE?
 CHARLES OAKLEY RETIRED IN 2004.
 PABLO: AND YET HIS SPIRIT
 REMAINS WITH US STILL.
 BOMANI: I WOULD BE SCARED TO
 FIGHT HIM.
 IN CLOSING, A LET OF MY FRIENDS
 WERE IN TOWN THIS WEEKEND.
 THEY DIDN'T CALL ME TO HANG OUT
 THOUGH.
 HUH-UH.
 THEY WERE TOO BUSY GETTING
 READY FOR "WRESTLEMANIA."
 APPARENTLY THEY WOULD RATHER DO
 STUFF LIKE THIS.
 THERE IS THE PARKING LOT AT
 "WRESTLEMANIA."
 PABLO: OH, MAN.
 [LAUGHTER]
 BOMANI: THAT IS CONCRETE DOWN
 THERE.
 PABLO: IN BUFFALO WHEN THEY DO
 THIS, THERE IS SNOW AND STUFF.
 BOMANI: WOW.
 COME ON, MAN.
 PABLO: I KNOW THAT GUY IS
 THEORETICALLY PLAYING IT, BUT
 IF YOU TOLD ME HE WAS
 PARALYZED, I WOULD BELIEVE
 THAT.
 BOMANI: WHO IS SHOWING UP IN
 THE FOOTLOCKER SUIT TO
 "WRESTLEMANIA"?
 WOW.
 PABLO: THAT IS BASICALLY LIKE
 SHOWING UP IN A KOBE JERSEY AT
 THIS POINT.
 THE REFEREES ARE ESSENTIAL TO
 THE ENTERPRISE.
 WE TURNED DOWN TICKETS TO
 "WRESTLEMANIA."
 BOMANI: WE DID.
 I CAN'T BE OUT THERE EIGHT
 HOURS WATCHING "WRESTLEMANIA."
 I WISH WE COULD TAKE THE TIME
 AND GO THROUGH THE PHOTOS AND
 COUNT THE WEDDING RINGS.
 I WANT TO TALK TO THE WOMEN
 MARRIED TO THESE DUDES.
 HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT THIS?
 PABLO: ALL I KNOW IS THERE WAS
  TOO MUCH TIME SPEPT IN
 PARKING LOTS.
 THAT VINDICATED MY DECISION NOT
 TO GO.
 THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN DOING
 THIS IS BEING TRAPPED WITH THE
 PEOPLE DOING THIS AFTER THE
 GAME.
 BOMANI: WHAT IS THIS?
 MANIA?
 PABLO: A SPECTACLE.
 IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE TO
 SHOW YOU THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 THE LETTER OF SUBWAY LAW AND
 THE SPIRIT OF SUBWAY LAW.
 LET'S WATCH.
 PABLO: THERE IS A RULE ON THE SUBWAY THAT YOU CAN BRING A DOG
 ON THE TRAIN IF YOU HAVE YOUR
 DOG IN A BAG.
 AND THAT IS A AMEZAGA IN
 SOMETHING BAG-LIKE.
 BOMANI: ON A STRING.
 PABLO: THE CONDUCTOR IS LIKE
 NO, YOU CANNOT OPERATION DUMBO
 DROP INTO MY TRAIN.
 NO, YOU CANNOT DO THAT.
 BO, YOU ARE A SUBWAY RIDER WITH
 MORE DILIGENCE THAN ME.
 DO YOU HAVE SYMPATHY FOR ANY OF
 THE
