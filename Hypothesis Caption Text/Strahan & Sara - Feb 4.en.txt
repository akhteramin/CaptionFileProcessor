So I was excited about All-New Colgate Total. Its breakthrough formula does more... Wonderful. Sensitivity, strengthens teeth... It kills germs through my whole mouth.. I like your confidence. Thanks Mr. Lee! Now there's no such thing as too close. Yes, there is. No, there's not. Yes there is. No, there's not! Okay. <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i> <i> Do more for your whole mouth.</i> <i> Let's see, ALEVE is</i> <i> proven better on pain</i> <i> than Tylenol Extra Strength.</i> <i> And last longer</i> <i> with fewer pills.</i> So why am I still thinking about this? I'll take Aleve. <i> ALEVE.</i> <i> Proven better on pain.</i> This time, it's his turn. You have 4.3 minutes to yourself. This calls for a taste of cheesecake. Philadelphia Cheesecake Cups.

IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN THE BATHROOM WITH RECURRING CONSTIPATION AND BELLY PAIN TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR AND SAY YESSS! TO LINZESS. YESSS! LINZESS TREATS ADULTS WITH IBS WITH CONSTIPATION OR CHRONIC CONSTIPATION. LINZESS CAN HELP RELIEVE YOUR BELLY PAIN AND LETS YOU HAVE MORE FREQUENT AND COMPLETE BOWEL MOVEMENTS. LINZESS IS NOT A LAXATIVE. IT WORKS DIFFERENTLY TO HELP YOU GET AHEAD OF YOUR RECURRING CONSTIPATION AND BELLY PAIN. DO NOT GIVE LINZESS TO CHILDREN LESS THAN 6, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN 6 TO LESS THAN 18, IT MAY HARM THEM. DO NOT TAKE LINZESS IF YOU HAVE A BOWEL BLOCKAGE. GET IMMEDIATE HELP IF YOU DEVELOP UNUSUAL OR SEVERE STOMACH PAIN, ESPECIALLY WITH BLOODY OR BLACK STOOLS. THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECT IS DIARRHEA, SOMETIMES SEVERE. IF IT'S SEVERE, STOP TAKING LINZESS AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY. OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE GAS, STOMACH-AREA PAIN, AND SWELLING. SO SAY YESSS! TO HELP FOR RECURRING CONSTIPATION. YESSS! TO HELP FOR BELLY PAIN. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR AND SAY YESSS!
