  give you two       bucks for the chair.
     Two?! That's a Victorian             antique!
   All right, how much for the         recliner, then?
  Wait wait... how did that get            out here?
 That is definitely not for sale!
       Is this a yard sale?
 If it's in the yard then it's...            for sale.
         Oh, here we go.

 HAPPY, HAPPY MONDAY.
 YEAH.
 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME
 CUPCAKES TODAY WITH BRIAN ORAKPO
 AND MICHAEL GRIFFIN.
 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE
 SUPER BOWL.
 WE'RE GOING TO REVEAL WHO
 WON.
 YEAH.
 WAIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR
 SEATS.
 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DAD
 CODE AND WORDS YOU DON'T WANT TO
 USE.
 WE HAVE A WHOLE BIG SHOW COMING
 FOR YOU TODAY.
 A LITTLE FASHION, A LITTLE
 EVERYTHING AND THE GREATEST
 AUDIENCE IN TV.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 FROM THE CROSS ROADS OF THE
 WORLD, TIMES SQUARE, NEW YORK
 CITY, IT'S "STRAHAN AND SARA."
 ESCAPE FOR AN HOUR.
 WE ALL NEED IT.

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 BOY, BOY, BOY.
 OH.
 HAPPY MONDAY.
 HAPPY MONDAY, EVERYBODY.
 THANK YOU GUYS FOR JOINING US
 TODAY.
 YEAH.
 AND YOU KNOW, ON FRIDAY'S
 SHOW -HOW ARE YOU DOING BY THE
 WAY?
 HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND?
 ARE YOU OKAY?
 I'M DOING GOOD.
 I WAS JUST WITH YOU.
 I FEEL LIKE WE JUST SAW EACH
 OTHER.
 CAN'T GET AWAY FROM EACH
 OTHER.
 NOTHING LIKE HANGING OUT FOR
 THE SUPER BOWL WITH A HALL OF
 FAMER.
 WAY FUN.
 MY REAL ESTATE JUST WENT WAY
 UP.
 YOU SAID THAT LIKE WE WERE UP
 TO SOMETHING BAD.
 NO.
 GOOD PEOPLE.
 MY HUSBAND WAS THERE.
 NO.
 IT'S GETTING WEIRD.
 MAX, YOU WERE THERE.
 ON FRIDAY'S SHOW, WE READ YOU A
 TWEET WE GOT FROM LIDS, WHICH
 IS THE HAT STORE THAT SELLS HATS
 RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM OUR
 STUDIO, AND THEY WROTE, LOOK,
 MOM.
 I'M ON TV.
 SHOUTOUT TO @STRAHANANDSARA,
 BECAUSE WITH OUR NEW SET, YOU
 CAN SEE THE SIGN FOR THEIR
 STORE.
 IT'S LITERALLY RIGHT ACROSS THE
 STREET.
 FREE ADVERTISING.
 IT'S FREE, RIGHT?
 SO WE PUT UP OUR OWN SIGN TO
 BLOCK THEIR SIGN, AND OF COURSE,
 WE'LL TAKE IT DOWN JUST AS SOON
 AS YOU SEND US "STRAHAN AND
 SARA" HATS, RIGHT?
 THEY WATCH OUR SHOW.
 THANK YOU.
 WE'RE GLAD AND ON FRIDAY THEY
 TWEETED, CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
 AND SURE ENOUGH,
 8:00 A.M., A MESSAGE ARRIVED AT
 THE STUDIO WITH THESE HATS, AND
 WE HAVE THE HATS.
 BRING THEM IN.
 THERE WE GO.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 YEAH.
 YES.
 THAT'S A LITTLE SMALL FOR ME.
 WAIT.
 I THINK I GOT THE WRONG HAT,
 MICHAEL.
 I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ADJUST.
 WAIT.
 THIS IS CUTE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 I LIKE THAT.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, LIDS?
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 SINCE YOU LIVE UP TO YOUR WORD,
 WE'RE GOING TO LIVE UP TO OUR
 WORD.
 THERE YOU GO.
 ALL THE ADVERTISING YOU WANT.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 AND, YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST
 WITH YOU.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED.
 SO WE SHOULD KEEP USING THIS TO
 OUR ADVANTAGE.
 OH, NO.
 I'M AHEAD OF YOU ON THIS ONE.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I LIKE THAT.
 I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK.
 PRETTY GOOD.
 I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK.
 YEAH.
 I NEED A NEW RIDE, ELON.
 I PULL MY WEIGHT HERE.
 SO WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?
 WHAT ELSE WE GOT HERE?
 SUPER BOWL.
 NO.
 ON FRIDAY I PROMISED THAT WE
 WOULD REVEAL THE WINNER OF LAST
 NIGHT'S SUPER BOWL.
 RIGHT HERE ON OUR SHOW.
 THIS IS THE TYPE OF BIG REVEAL
 THAT CAN REALLY GENERATE SOME
 BUZZ FOR A SHOW LIKE OURS, LIKE,
 WHOA.
 SARA HAINES AND THAT FELLA THAT
 SITS NEXT TO HER ARE REALLY
 PLUGGED IN TO WHAT'S HAPPENING
 IN AMERICA.
 SO THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPION IS --
 I ACTUALLY LEFT EARLY.
 YEAH.
 IT WAS 3-3 WHEN YOU LEFT.
 YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO WON, DO
 YOU?
 DO YOU KNOW WHO WON?
 I HAVE READ.
 IT'S THE --
 THE PATRIOTS.
 YEAH.
 TOM BRADY.
 YEAH, THE PATRIOTS.
 OH, YOU KNOW.
 THE PATRIOTS BEAT THE RAMS 13-3,
 AND --
 THAT WAS THE LOWEST SCORING
 GAME, WASN'T IT?
 THE LOWEST SCORING GAME IN
 NFL HISTORY, AND I KNOW YOU'RE A
 LITTLE UPSET, BUT FOR A LOT OF
 PEOPLE OUT THERE, I THINK IT'S
 GREAT THAT BOSTON FINALLY GOT
 SOME GOOD SPORTS NEWS.
 I MEAN, THEY HAVE BEEN ON A
 3 1/2-MONTH CHAMPIONSHIP DROUGHT
 EVER SINCE THE RED SOX WON.
 THAT CITY DESERVES GOOD NEWS.
 I KNOW.
 I WAS JUST HOPING -I LIKE TO
 CHEER ON THE UNDERDOG.
 I LIKE CHEERING ON THE
 UNDERDOG, BUT I LOOK AT IT
 ALSO -TOM BRADY IS THE
 G.O.A.T.
 HE'S THE GREATEST QUARTERBACK TO
 EVER PLAY THE GAME, BUT FOR
 EVERY ONE OF THOSE SIX
 CHAMPIONSHIPS, IT IS ONE OF
 THOSE GUYS' FIRST TIME WINNING.
 THAT'S TRUE, MICHAEL.
 THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT.
 I LOOK AT THE YOUNG GUYS THAT
 NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO WIN.
 WE WATCHED THE GAME TOGETHER.
 OH.
 IT WAS FUN UNTIL YOU LEFT
 EARLY.
 IT WAS SUCH GOOD FOOD.
 WELL, I CAME FOR THE FOOD.
 MICHAEL'S FIRST RESPONSE WHEN I
 GOT THERE WAS, YOU'RE HERE
 EARLY.
 I WAS, LIKE, THIS IS WHAT TIME
 WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE AND
 I'M ALREADY, LIKE, AT THE
 BUFFET.
 MAX IS, LIKE, I THINK YOU CAN
 HELP YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'RE
 PREGNANT.
 I WAS, LIKE, THEY'RE SETTING THE
 FOOD UP.
 I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
 TAKE IT WHILE THEY'RE SETTING IT
 UP.
 IT WAS SO GOOD.
 WE POSTED A PICTURE BECAUSE YOU
 HIT IT KIND OF HARD ON THE
 DESSERT TRAY.
 I DID.
 WHY NOT?
 THE BUFFET, ONE OF
 EVERYTHING.
 THE DESSERT, YOU PICK ONE.
 YOU TOOK ONE OF EVERYTHING ON
 THE DESSERT.
 IT WAS MAGNOLIA BAKERY, WHICH
 IS, LIKE, ADDICTIVE, AND
 THEN YOU HAVE THE COOKIES FROM
 THE BAKERY WHICH IS EVEN MORE,
 AND THEN YOU HAD THE CUPCAKES
 AND ALL THAT STUFF WHICH I'M
 EXCITED BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE
 CUPCAKES TODAY ON THE SHOW.
 YOU HAD A TEN-DAY CHALLENGE
 THAT YOU BROKE, AND I WOULD LIKE
 TO CALL YOU OUT ON THIS.
 I DIDN'T NECESSARILY BREAK
 IT.
 IF MY MATH SERVES ME
 CORRECTLY, YOU MADE IT SEVEN
 DAYS.
 THAT'S A LITTLE SHY OF TEN.
 I DID SEVEN.
 YOU KNOW, TEN DAYS --
 J-LO AND ALEX WANTED ME TO DO
 TEN DAYS AND I RESPECT THEM, BUT
 YOU TWO ARE ON YOUR OWN JOURNEY.
 DON'T BRING ME INTO THAT.
 I EAT WELL ANYWAY, AND I WORK
 OUT AND I DO ALL THAT STUFF I
 SEE THEM DO ON INSTAGRAM.
 HE'S, LIKE, I WORK OUT.
 I LOOK GOOD.
 I EAT WHAT I WANT.
 I WAS, LIKE, OH MY GOSH,
 MICHAEL.
 LITERALLY JUST TRYING TO
 JUSTIFY THE FACT THAT I CUT IT
 TO SEVEN DAYS INSTEAD OF TEN.
 BUT IT WAS SUPER BOWL.
 WHO WANTS TO EAT ON THE SUPER
 BOWL?
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THAT WAS -IT WAS A SILLY
 MATH PROBLEM.
 WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE SIGNED YOU
 UP FOR THAT.
 IT WAS A SILLY -BUT THINK
 ABOUT IT.
 WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT AND I
 THINK ABOUT THE FOOD THAT WAS
 THERE, HOW COULD I NOT HAVE
 BROKEN THE CHALLENGE?
 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN, LIKE,
 NO.
 AND DID YOU SEE WHAT THEY DID
 END AT THE END OF THEIR
 CHALLENGE?
 DID YOU WATCH THEIR POST?
 I SAW.
 I SAW WHAT THEY DID.
 THAT'S HOW THEY CELEBRATED.
 PIZZAS AND YOU NAME IT.
 HE HAD IT, BUT I GUARANTEE HE
 DIDN'T EAT ALL OF THAT.
 I KNOW HE DIDN'T.
 I BET HE POSED AND HE TOOK,
 LIKE, A NIBBLE.
 I HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE AND
 WALKED AWAY, LIKE, I'M SO
 SKINNY.
 NOW I CAN JUST SAY MICHAEL'S THE
 REAL DEAL BECAUSE HE STUFFED HIS
 FACE AND I WITNESSED IT.
 YEAH.
 I WENT IN.
 LIKE, IF I'M GOING, I'M GOING
 HARD.
 I DON'T BACK OFF OF IT, BUT
 YEAH.
 CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM ON THEIR
 TEN DAYS.
 I'M HAPPY WITH MY WEEK.
 YOU MADE IT A POWER SEVEN.
 BUT I'LL BE GOOD.
 I'LL STILL -I'LL STILL, YOU
 KNOW, DIBBLE AND DABBLE IN IT.
 YOU PROMISED AN AFTER PICTURE
 BY THE WAY.
 I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE SEVEN-DAY
 ABS LOOK LIKE.
 THERE IS AN AFTER PICTURE.
 I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
 I'M SORRY.
 SO MANY BROKEN PROMISES.
 I'M JUST SAYING.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
 I AM GOING TO POST AN AFTER
 PICTURE.
 PLEASE DO THAT.
 TOMORROW, WE'LL HAVE THE
 BEFORE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
 THE AFTER PICTURE.
 AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO
 DIFFERENT IT'S GOING TO INSPIRE
 ALL OF YOU GUYS.
 YOU KNOW.
 YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT'S
 UNDER ALL THIS.
 JUST MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I CAN'T -I CAN'T WAIT.
 BUT THE ONE THING EVERYBODY
 TALKED ABOUT OF COURSE, IS
 HALFTIME.
 THE HALFTIME SHOW, THE
 COMMERCIALS.
 COMMERCIALS, YEAH.
 AND I LOVE THE COMMERCIALS.
 ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO,
 AND I KNOW YOU LIKE THEM --
 THEY'RE BETTER THAN SOME OF
 THE GAMES IF WE'RE BEING HONEST.
 THIS GAME WAS A LITTLE QUIET.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THESE
 COMMERCIALS, DO YOU REALIZE HOW
 MUCH THESE COMMERCIALS COST FOR
 30 SECONDS?
 SO MUCH.
 $5.25 MILLION.
 $5.25 MILLION
 JUST FOR 30 SECONDS.
 AND WE HAND IT OUT FOR FREE
 TO LIDS.
 I MEAN -SAMESIES.
 WHICH IS JUST GIVING IT AWAY.
 GIVING IT AWAY.
 GIVING IT AWAY.
 BUT I TELL YOU WHAT.
 WE HERE WERE SO HAPPY AT THIS
 SHOW --
 YEAH.
 HONORED.

 THAT THE NETWORK DECIDED THAT
 THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE US A
 SUPER BOWL AD, AND $5.25 MILLION
 FOR 30 SECONDS AND HERE'S WHAT
 THEY DID FOR US.
 YO.
 LUNCHTIME AT 1:00 EASTERN
 12:00 CENTRAL AND PACIFIC ON
 ABC.
 ABOUT RIGHT.
 THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.
 YOU NOTICED THAT BECAUSE MY NAME
 COMES SECOND, WE BARELY GOT SARA
 ON THERE BEFORE WE FADED TO
 BLACK.
 WE ONLY HAD FOUR SECONDS.
 WE HAD FOUR SECONDS AND YOU KNOW
 WHAT?
 NONE OF YOU GUYS ARE GETTING
 PAID FOR BEING HERE TODAY.
 JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.
 HAD TO CUT INTO THE BUDGET.
 BUT IT WAS COOL.
 YOUR COMMERCIAL WAS MY
 FAVORITE.
 THE FOOTBALL ONE.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 THE NFL COMMERCIAL.
 WELL, THE MICHAEL STRAHAN
 COMMERCIAL.
 I RECOGNIZED YOU AND KNEW THE
 OTHER PEOPLE WERE SUPER
 IMPORTANT.
 I WAS, LIKE, OH MY GOSH.
 ALL THESE FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND
 KNEW NONE OF THEM.
 IT WAS LIKE "WEDDING CRASHERS".
 IT WAS ONLY EVERY --
 GREAT PLAYER EVER.
 GREAT PLAYER OF COURSE, WHO
 IS STILL LIVING AND THE
 100-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE NFL.
 IT WAS A LOT OF FUN, AND WHEN
 YOU ARE THERE FOR ME SHOOTING
 IT, I'M AMAZED.
 I'M, LIKE, OH MY GOODNESS.
 THERE'S JIM BROWN, THERE'S JERRY
 RICE, THERE'S DEION SANDERS, AND
 JOE MONTANA.
 THERE'S MICHAEL SINGLETARY.
 THESE ARE ALL GUYS I GREW UP
 WATCHING AND THEN
 THE WHOLE COMMERCIAL COMES
 TOGETHER WITH BAKER MAYFIELD AND
 BRADY AND ALL THESE GUYS AS
 WELL.
 ODELL, AND IT'S, LIKE, WOW.
 SAQUON, KEEP ON NAMING GUYS.
 AND YOU POSTED SOME FUNNY
 MOMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES.
 I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S PROBABLY
 LIKE HERDING CATS WHEN YOU GET
 TOGETHER.
 JUST HAVING FUN.
 I WAS DOING MOST OF MY STUFF
 WITH PEYTON AND I WAS TRYING TO
 GET HIM TO CRACK UP.
 SO I POSTED SOME
 BEHIND-THE-SCENES SCENES THAT
 DIDN'T MAKE IT AND I SAID, YOU
 KNOW, PEYTON, YOU HAVE NEVER
 LIVED UNTIL YOU GET GRABBED
 UNDER THE PILE.
 TWO HANDS.
 AND THEN HE'S SITTING THERE AND
 HE'S, LIKE, YEAH, YEAH.
 THEN I GO, YOU GOT TO CLENCH
 YOUR BUTT CHEEKS REAL TIGHT.
 THAT GOT HIM TO LAUGH.

 HE BROKE.
 I BROKE HIM.

 BUT IT WAS GOOD.
 COMMERCIALS ARE ONE OF MY
 FAVORITE THINGS.
 AND THE "GAME OF THRONES"
 ONE.
 YOU'RE A THRONY.
 IT'S A THRONER.
 IT'S A THRONER.
 WHO IS A THRONER OUT HERE?
 I LOVE THIS WOMAN'S QUIZZICAL
 LOOK.
 SHE'S, LIKE, WHAT IS THIS?
 ANYONE WHO IS OBSESSED
 WITH "GAME OF THRONES."
 I APPRECIATE THE SHOW.
 I REALLY DO.
 I THINK IT'S SO THEATRICAL, BUT
 YOU HAVE TO START WRITING DOWN
 NAMES AND WHO IS WITH WHO AND
 THE FACTIONS AND I JUST -MAN.
 THIS IS, LIKE, WORK.
 YOU JUST EVENTUALLY GET IT.
 YOU JUST KEEP WATCHING.
 IT'S KIND OF LIKE MARRIAGE,
 HUH?
 JUST HANG IN THERE.
 HANG IN THERE AND HOLD ON.
 EVENTUALLY SOME OF IT WILL MAKE
 SENSE.
 WE'RE SO OFF TRACK Y'ALL HAVE
 NO IDEA.
 YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW OFF TRACK
 WE ARE.
 WE HAVE 30 SECONDS.
 WHAT YOU GOT?
 GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR 30
 SECONDS.
 CAN WE DO THE LITTLE BOY?
 EARLIER IN THE WEEK, WE COVERED
 A STORY OF A LITTLE BOY WHO
 CALLED 911 FOR HELP WITH HIS
 HOMEWORK AND THAT WAS SO SWEET.
 HERE'S A CALL THAT WAS MADE TO
 EMERGENCY SERVICES FAR SLIGHTLY
 DIFFERENT REASON.
 THE AVON FIRE AND RESCUE IN THE
 UK GOT A CALL RECENTLY TO HELP A
 YOUNG BOY AND THIS IS WHAT THEY
 FOUND.
 THAT GUY DARED TO CHAIR A LITTLE
 TOO HARD.
 THAT YOUNG BOY GOT HIS HEAD
 CAUGHT IN THE HOLE OF A POTTY
 TRAINING SEAT.
 THIS IS WHY PARENTING IS SO
 DANGEROUS.
 LOOK AT THIS.
 NO.
 THAT'S WHY -YOU KNOW WHAT?
 THAT'S JUST BAD PARENTING.
 THEY TOLD HIM TO PUT THE WRONG
 END IN THAT, YOU KNOW.
 COME ON, PARENTS.
 I BLAME YOU FOR THAT.
 THEY DID HAVE TO CUT IT OUT.
 THAT POTTY SEAT WILL NEVER BE
 THE SAME AGAIN.
 AND THAT KID WILL PROBABLY BE IN
 DIAPERS UNTIL HE'S 12.
 I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 TO SUM IT UP, I'LL BE HONEST
 WITH YOU.
 HE'LL NEVER PUT THE SEAT DOWN,
 LADIES.
 THERE WE GO.
 COMING UP, EVERYBODY, IF YOU
 ARE A RAMS FAN AND YOU'RE
 FEELING BLUE TODAY, WE
 UNDERSTAND.
 WE HAVE THE PERFECT WAY TO
 BRIGHTEN YOUR DAY.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 STAY RIGHT THERE.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 SOMETHING TO SAY.
 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE
 THIS.
 THIS GUY LOOKS FAMILIAR.
 CONGRATS ON THE SHOW,
 "STRAHAN AND SARA." I WANT TO
 SAY I THINK THE NAME SUCKS
 BECAUSE IT HAS STRAHAN FIRST.
 IT SHOULD BE SARA FIRST.
 SARA AND STRAHAN.
 THE ROCK, THE DOOR IS
 UNLOCKED.

 LUNCHTIME ON ABC.
 WELCOME BACK.
 THERE WERE A LOT OF COMMERCIALS
 DURING THE SUPER BOWL LAST
 NIGHT, AND FOR THOSE WATCHING IN
 HOUSTON, THIS AWESOME AD
 DEFINITELY CAUGHT YOUR
 ATTENTION.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 THIS IS SMASH THERAPY IN
 NORTH SPRING, TEXAS.
 IT'S A PLACE TO FIND INNER
 PEACE.

 OUR SPONSOR, HEAD & SHOULDERS
 DECIDED TO CELEBRATE UNIQUE
 BUSINESSES LIKE JENNIFER'S
 HOUSTON-BASED SMASH THERAPY AS
 PART OF THEIR NEW CAMPAIGN
 CHAMPIONING PEOPLE WHO ARE
 HEADSTRONG AND OVERCOME DOUBT
 AND FEAR TO START SUCCESSFUL
 LOCAL BUSINESSES.
 HOW COOL WAS THAT?
 OH MY GOD.
 I'M JUST, LIKE, TAKING IT IN ALL
 RIGHT NOW.
 I HEARD YOU SAY ON "GMA" THAT
 THIS WAS, LIKE, REALLY THE FIRST
 TIME IT WAS HITTING YOU.
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 JUST, LIKE, THIS MORNING I WAS,
 LIKE, WAS I REALLY ON THE SUPER
 BOWL?
 THAT'S SO COOL.
 THAT'S BEYOND COOL.
 THAT'S, LIKE, THE COOLEST THING
 EVER.
 I KNOW.
 I'M, LIKE, SWEATING.
 NOW YOU DECIDED TO OPEN A
 PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN SMASH
 THINGS AND YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD
 NEVER WORK.
 OH, NO.
 I THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK.
 THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD WORK.
 I WAS, LIKE, LET'S STAY
 HEADSTRONG HERE, AND THIS IS
 WHAT I WANT TO DO, AND I'M GOING
 TO DO IT.
 EVERYBODY ELSE, THEY'RE GOING TO
 FALL IN LINE.
 AND THEY DID.
 THEY DID, AND THEY WILL.
 WHAT KEPT YOU MOTIVATED?
 I JUST HAD A BABY.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I HAD JUST HAD MY FIRST BABY AND
 I WAS, LIKE, I WANT TO OPEN A
 BUSINESS.
 I DID ALL THESE THINGS FOR ALL
 THESE PEOPLE AND I THOUGHT I WAS
 GOING TO BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW,
 MAKE MY SCHEDULE, AND I WANTED
 TO HELP PEOPLE.
 THAT'S WHAT I DO ALREADY.
 I WORK IN A MENTAL HEALTH
 HOSPITAL, AND I WAS, LIKE,
 EVERYBODY NEEDS A BREAK AND
 LET'S JUST DO THIS SO PEOPLE
 DON'T FEEL LIKE, HEY.
 I'M CRAZY.
 NO, YOU'RE NOT.
 I LIKE YOUR FORM OF THERAPY.
 WE NEED MORE OF YOU, CLOSER TO
 NEW YORK.
 MICHAEL IS OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW
 WITH A FEW PEOPLE WHO COULD USE
 SOME SMASH THERAPY.
 YEAH, YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHAT
 IT FEELS LIKE TO WIN THE
 CHAMPIONSHIP, BUT I ALSO KNOW
 WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOUR
 TEAM DOESN'T BECAUSE I LOST ONE
 AS WELL.
 I'M HERE WITH ARMAND AND VINCE
 AND THEY'RE FEELING THE PAIN
 BECAUSE THEIR RAMS WERE THE
 LOSING TEAM LAST NIGHT.
 SO WE DECIDED THERE IS NO BETTER
 WAY TO HELP THEM OUT THAN WITH A
 LITTLE SMASH THERAPY.
 THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS NEEDED.
 YOU NEED THIS, RIGHT?
 OH, YEAH.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO HOLD BACK
 ON IT.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET READY.
 ARMAND, YOU'RE FIRST.
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU IN THE
 SMASH TANK VEHICLE.
 HOP IN, MY FRIEND.
 YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS TO GO FOR IT
 AND TAKE OUT ALL THAT
 FRUSTRATION ON YOUR RAMS LOSS.
 PUT YOUR MASK DOWN.
 YOU READY?
 15 SECONDS.
 GO.
 GET IT OUT.
 OH, HE'S MAD.
 OH.
 OH, THE HAMMERS AND HE'S GOING
 AT IT.
 OH.

 HOLD UP, BUD.
 OKAY.
 REAL QUICK, HOW DID THAT FEEL?
 IT FELT AMAZING.
 AMAZING?
 AMAZING.
 STILL NOT ENOUGH TO GET OVER
 THE LOSS, BUT IT'S A LITTLE
 SOMETHING WE CAN DO FOR YOU.
 OH YEAH.
 VINCE, YOU'RE UP.
 HOW TALL ARE YOU?

 IF YOU WOULD HAVE PLAYED LAST
 NIGHT, THEY MAY HAVE WON.
 GO AHEAD AND HOP IN THERE,
 VINCE.
 WE HAVE BATS IN HERE.
 WE HAVE HAMMERS AND WE HAVE GOT
 EVERYTHING.
 15 SECONDS, VINCE.
 TAKE OUT THAT AGGRESSION.
 CLOSE THAT DOOR, MAN.

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 OH, BOY.
 OKAY.
 LET VINCE OUT OF THERE, MAN.
 HE'S -VINCE, I FEEL IS
 DANGEROUS.
 COME ON OUT, MAN.
 TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, I DON'T WANT
 TO MAKE YOU MAD AT A FAMILY
 HOLIDAY PARTY.
 YOU'LL TEAR UP THE WHOLE HOUSE.
 HOW DID IT FEEL?
 FELT GREAT.
 REALLY?
 WAITED 17 YEARS FOR BRADY TO
 GET ANOTHER CHOICE AND THEY
 SCORED 3 POINTS, BUT THAT FEELS
 GOOD.
 THE RAMS ARE YOUNG AND THEY
 HAVE A GOOD TEAM.
 THEY'LL BE BACK.
 HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T BE IN OUR
 SMASH TANK.
 SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU SO
 MUCH.
 YOU KNOW, SARA.
 JENNIFER WHO IS UP THERE WITH
 YOU, WE WENT TO THE SAME
 COLLEGE, SAME SCHOOL.
 I WANTED TO SAY HEY, ALUMNI.
 HEY.

 THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT
 DISTINCTION.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,
 JENNIFER.
 THANK YOU.
 WE WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSOR,

 SEGMENT.
 WE'LL BE BACK WITH ONE OF THE
 STARS FROM "AMERICAN HOUSEWIFE,"

  on irreversible joint damage.
    Ongoing pain and stiffness
   are signs of joint erosion.
 HUMIRA can help stop the clock.
     Prescribed for 15 years,
    HUMIRA targets and blocks    a source of inflammation
         that contributes         to joint pain
     and irreversible damage.
   VO:<i> HUMIRA can lower your</i>  <i> ability to fight infections.</i>
      <i> Serious and sometimes</i>      <i> fatal infections</i>
     <i> including tuberculosis,</i>
     <i> and cancers, including</i>     <i> lymphoma, have happened,</i>
    <i> as have blood, liver, and</i>    <i> nervous system problems,</i>
   <i> serious allergic reactions,</i>
      <i> and new or worsening</i>         <i> heart failure.</i>
        <i> Tell your doctor</i>     <i> if you've been to areas</i>
     <i> where certain fungal</i>     <i> infections are common,</i>
      <i> and if you've had TB,</i>          <i> hepatitis B,</i>
    <i> are prone to infections,</i>
       <i> or have flu-like</i>       <i> symptoms or sores.</i>
       <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i>    <i> if you have an infection.</i>
              Woman:       Help stop the clock
     on further irreversible          joint damage.

         <i> No more excuses</i>         <i> with Cologuard.</i>
    We all make excuses for the    things we don't want to do.
       But when it comes to     colon cancer screening...
        I'm not doin' that.
       I eat plenty of kale.
     Ahem, as I was saying...
        ...with Cologuard,    you don't need an excuse...
          All that prep?            No thanks.
    That drink tastes horrible!
         But...there's no      prep with Cologuard...
         I can't take the          time off work.
         Who has two days?
         And I feel fine           no symptoms!
        Everybody, listen!
         All you need is a       trip to the bathroom.
       If you're 50 or older       and at average risk,
         Cologuard is the        noninvasive option

         You just get the         kit in the mail,
       go to the bathroom,       collect your sample,
     then ship it to the lab!
        This is your year!
              Own it!
     <i> Cologuard is not right</i>         <i> for everyone.</i>

 GUESS WHAT, MRS. OTTO? YOU ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE TWO
 LEADS OF "LITTLE SHOP OF
 HORRORS."
 OH MY GOD.
 HONEY, THAT IS AWESOME.
 BUT WEREN'T YOU JUST THE
 UNDERSTUDY?
 I WAS, BUT THEN JULIE HAD A
 BREAKDOWN FROM ALL THE PRESSURE
 SO SHE SPRAY PAINTED DIRTY WORDS
 ON THE DRAMA TEACHER'S CAR.
 THAT WAS MEG DONNELLY IN THE
 HIT SHOW, "AMERICAN HOUSEWIFE,"
 AND LUCKY FOR US, MEG IS ALSO
 OUR VERY OWN RESIDENT TEEN
 EXPERT.
 YES, SHE IS.
 NOW MEG IS HERE TO HELP --
 YOU'RE HERE TO HELP US AS WELL
 AS PARENTS EVERYWHERE UNDERSTAND
 JUST WHAT THE HECK THEIR TEENS
 ARE TALKING ABOUT IN A SEGMENT
 WE'RE CALLING "DECODE YOUR
 TEEN."
 YES.
 DECODE YOUR TEEN.
 IT'S A THING.

 WE WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR.
 THESE ARE WORDS US PARENTS CAN
 LEARN, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT --
 SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THEM
 YOURSELF.
 NO.
 PARENTS.
 ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MEG?
 YES.
 THAT'S VERY RIGHT.
 MY DAD USES THE WORD, LIT, AND
 IT'S THE MOST EMBARRASSING THING
 EVER.
 PLEASE DON'T.
 PLEASE DON'T, OKAY?
 ALL RIGHT.
 OKAY.
 FIRST UP, WE'RE GOING TO
 START OUT WITH THE TEA.
 THE TEA.
 DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY GUESSES FOR
 WHAT THE TEA IS?
 I KNOW WHAT THE TEA IS.
 IS IT A SPECIAL DRINK?
 NO.
 LIKE SPECIAL OTHER THAN TEA.
 I THINK I KNOW THIS ONE.
 THE TEA IS ANOTHER WORD FOR
 GOSSIP.
 SO, YOU KNOW, SPILL THE TEA.
 DO YOU HAVE SOME HOT TEA, WHAT'S
 THE TEA?
 WHEN YOU TELL GOSSIP, YOU HAVE A
 CUP OF TEA AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
 THAT.
 THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT IS.
 DO YOU GUYS EVEN DRINK TEA?
 NOT REALLY.
 WE DRINK COFFEE.
 THEY SPILL TEA.
 THEY DON'T DRINK IT.
 THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULDN'T USE IT.
 YOU SHOULDN'T USE IT.
 I'M STILL VERY YOUNG,
 MICHAEL.
 NEXT UP.
 NEXT UP IS SNACK.
 SNACK.
 OH, I KNOW THIS ONE.
 YOU DO?
 IS IT, LIKE, A HOT PERSON?
 YOU'RE, LIKE, OH, HE'S A SNACK.
 YES, EXACTLY.
 YEAH.
 WHEN SOMEONE'S REALLY
 ATTRACTIVE, YOU'RE, LIKE, OH.
 THAT'S A SNACK.
 YOU KNOW?
 IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT
 MICHAEL, YOU'RE, LIKE, IT'S A
 WHOLE VENDING MACHINE.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 DANG.
 OKAY.
 YOU STILL CAN'T USE THE WORD,
 BUT YOU MAY HAVE CREATED A NEW
 ONE.
 VENDING MACHINE.
 I'M SUCH A TEEN.
 NEXT IS CANCELED.
 CANCELED.
 IT'S KIND OF SELF-EXPLANATORY.
 WHEN SOMEONE DOES REALLY BAD,
 THEY'RE CANCELED.
 A FRIEND, A BOO, ANYTHING?
 THEY'RE JUST CANCELED.
 CANCELED OUT OF YOUR LIFE.
 LIKE --
 YOU TELL THEM THEY'RE
 CANCELED OR CAN YOU GHOST?
 YOU CAN GHOST IF YOU WANT TO,
 BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
 THEY'RE JUST CANCELED.
 DON'T RENEW YOUR
 SUBSCRIPTION.
 IT'S OVER.
 THIS WHOLE SEGMENT IS ABOUT
 STUFF NOT TO USE.
 YOU USING GHOST WAS NO.
 DON'T DO IT.
 YOU'RE ADDING WORDS.
 I'M ONE OF THOSE COOL MOMS.
 YEAH.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 ALL RIGHT.
 EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION OF
 THEMSELVES.
 HERE'S THE NEXT ONE WE GOT.
 THIRST TRAP.
 I DON'T KNOW THIS ONE.
 DOES ANYONE HAVE A GUESS FOR
 THIS ONE?
 I KNOW WHAT A THIRST TRAP IS.
 IT'S A PICTURE THAT YOU POST
 PROBABLY AT THE BEACH OR MAYBE
 IN THE GYM THAT YOU WANT PEOPLE
 TO, LIKE, PAY ATTENTION TO YOU,
 LIKE, GET THOSE DMs, YOU KNOW,
 GOING.
 YOU WANT SOMEONE TO SLIP INTO
 YOUR DMs.
 IT'S JUST A PICTURE THAT YOU
 LOOK REALLY GOOD IN THAT YOU
 POST.
 YOU MAKE SOMEBODY THIRSTY FOR
 YOU.
 EXACTLY.
 EXACTLY, YOU KNOW, LIKE -JUST
 GOT NEW EARRINGS.
 IS IT, LIKE, A SELFIE?
 I CAN'T GET MY GOODS PARTS WITH
 A SELFIE.
 I MEAN, IT CAN BE A SELFIE.
 ARE YOU THIRSTY?
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 SOMEONE ELSE CAN TAKE A THIRST
 TRAP.
 OF COURSE.
 I WANT TO USE IT PROPERLY.
 OUR LAST ONE IS GLOW UP.
 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS.
 IS THAT WHEN YOUR SOCIAL
 MEDIA GOES CRAZY AND YOU'RE,
 LIKE, IT'S GLOWING UP?
 NO.
 IT'S, LIKE --
 I'M, LIKE, DAD RIGHT NOW.
 BROKE ON THAT ONE.
 WHAT IS GLOW UP?
 IT'S KIND OF A
 TRANSFORMATION.
 SO SOME PEOPLE POST PICTURES OF,
 LIKE, MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEN
 THEM NOW AND IT'S, LIKE, I
 GLOWED UP.
 I LOOK BETTER NOW.
 YOU KNOW?
 LIKE A METAMORPHOSIS OF
 SORTS?
 EXACTLY.
 YEAH.
 SURE.
 LIKE INTERCHANGEABLE.
 TOTALLY.
 YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
 THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST
 INFORMATIVE SEGMENTS WE HAVE
 EVER HAD.
 WE NEED UP.
 WE NEED YOU.
 WE'RE GOING TO DO THESE.
 WE HAVE THESE NEW TEEN PHRASES
 THAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE AND OUR
 "STRAHAN AND SARA" RESIDENT DAD,
 JACK, IS IN THE HOUSE.
 DAD'S GOING TO GIVE THEM A TRY.
 WHAT'S UP, JACK?
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WELL, FIRST OF ALL, MEG, SO
 FAR THIS SEGMENT IS REALLY LIT.
 SO I WAS JUST OUTSIDE CLEANING
 OUT THE SHOW GUTTERS BECAUSE DAD
 RULE NUMBER ONE, NEVER HAVE A
 DIRTY GUTTER, RIGHT?
 THE WEIRD THING IS WE DON'T
 HAVE GUTTERS HERE AT THE SHOW.
 BUT GO AHEAD.
 I'M GOING TO TRY OUT ALL
 THESE PHRASES.
 I'M GOING TO GET THIS RIGHT.
 OKAY.
 I'M GOING TO GIVE IT THE OLD
 COLLEGE TRY AS WE SAY.
 OKAY.
 I'M ABOUT TO SPILL THE TEA.
 I WAS FEELING PRETTY CANCELED
 AROUND THE WIFE LATELY, BUT I
 HAVE BEEN HITTING THE GYM SO,
 THE GLOW UP IS REAL.
 BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, I'LL BE
 DEVELOPING SOME PHOTOS AT THE
 DRUGSTORE TO SEND THEM THIRST
 TRAPS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE A
 REAL SNACK.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
 YOU'RE FIRED.
 WHAT?
 YOU'RE FIRED.
 HONEY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
 ABLE TO AFFORD THE BREAKFAST.
 I'M SORRY.
 THANK YOU TO OUR RESIDENT
 DAD, JACK.
 AND A BIG THANK YOU -COME ON
 OVER HERE, MEG.
 COME ON, MEG.
 THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU TO MEG.

       I'm a close talker.
  So I was excited about All-New  Colgate Total.
  Its breakthrough formula does  more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
     I like your confidence.
         Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.
          Yes, there is.
         No, there's not.
          Yes there is.
         No, there's not!
              Okay.
      <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i>
  <i> Do more for your whole mouth.</i>
       <i> Let's see, ALEVE is</i>      <i> proven better on pain</i>
   <i> than Tylenol Extra Strength.</i>
         <i> And last longer</i>        <i> with fewer pills.</i>
        So why am I still       thinking about this?
         I'll take Aleve.
            <i> ALEVE.</i>    <i> Proven better on pain.</i>
    This time, it's his turn.
       You have 4.3 minutes           to yourself.
         This calls for a       taste of cheesecake.
  Philadelphia Cheesecake Cups.
     Rich, creamy cheesecake     with real strawberries.
        Find them with the      refrigerated desserts.
  (VO) Combine the right things.
  And something amazing happens.
 That's our inspiration for Fancy Feast Medleys.
      Wild Salmon Primavera.
         Tastes amazing.
          Also in pate.
       Fancy Feast Medleys.
    IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SPEND  TOO MUCH TIME IN THE BATHROOM
          WITH RECURRING   CONSTIPATION AND BELLY PAIN
       TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
    AND SAY YESSS! TO LINZESS.

              YESSS!
  LINZESS TREATS ADULTS WITH IBS
        WITH CONSTIPATION
     OR CHRONIC CONSTIPATION.
     LINZESS CAN HELP RELIEVE         YOUR BELLY PAIN
 AND LETS YOU HAVE MORE FREQUENT  AND COMPLETE BOWEL MOVEMENTS.
    LINZESS IS NOT A LAXATIVE.
     IT WORKS DIFFERENTLY TO    HELP YOU GET AHEAD OF YOUR
      RECURRING CONSTIPATION         AND BELLY PAIN.
       DO NOT GIVE LINZESS     TO CHILDREN LESS THAN 6,
  AND IT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO   CHILDREN 6 TO LESS THAN 18,
        IT MAY HARM THEM.
      DO NOT TAKE LINZESS IF    YOU HAVE A BOWEL BLOCKAGE.
        GET IMMEDIATE HELP          IF YOU DEVELOP
 UNUSUAL OR SEVERE STOMACH PAIN,
         ESPECIALLY WITH     BLOODY OR BLACK STOOLS.
  THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECT IS   DIARRHEA, SOMETIMES SEVERE.
     IF IT'S SEVERE,
     STOP TAKING LINZESS AND   CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY.
 OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE GAS,
 STOMACH-AREA PAIN, AND SWELLING.
      SO SAY YESSS!
           TO HELP FOR     RECURRING CONSTIPATION.
  YESSS! TO HELP FOR BELLY PAIN.
       TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
     AND SAY YESSS! LINZESS.

 Wondering how I upgraded to this sweet pad?
  A 1,200-square-foot bathroom,  and my very own spa.
   All I had to do was give my   human “the look”.

 DEDICATION.
 ONE THING WHEN WE OPENED UP THIS
 BUSINESS, WE MADE SURE OUR
 SIGNIFICANT OTHERS, AND OUR
 WIVES COULD NOT BE APART OF
 THIS.
 WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE CAN
 ALWAYS BE THERE.
 THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME THAT NOT
 ALL THREE OF US ARE IN AUSTIN
 THERE AT THE LOCATION, BUT

 SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO BE ON
 BOARD.
 DO YOU HAVE A MINIMUM OF HOW
 MANY YOU CAN EAT A DAY?
 IT'S HARD.
 WHEN YOU ARE WORKING, IT'S HARD.
 I TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM IT,

 Ok I'll admit. I didn't keep my place as clean as I would like
      'cuz I'm way too busy.
 Who's got the time to chase around down dirt, dust and hair?
 So now, I use Heavy Duty Swiffer Sweeper and Dusters.
 For hard-to-reach places, Duster makes it easy to clean.
  It captures dust in one swipe.
           Ha! Gotcha!
 And Sweeper Heavy Duty cloths lock away
   twice as much dirt and dust.
  It gets stuff deep in the  grooves other tools can miss.
  Y'know what? My place... is a  lot cleaner now.
 Stop cleaning. Start Swiffering.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME BACK.
 WE ARE HANGING WITH OUR FRIEND
 AND FOUNDER OF "THE 12ISH
 STYLE," KATIE STURINO.
 SHE'S KEEPING US IN STYLE FOR

 THAT'S RIGHT.
 WE NEED YOU.
 WHAT CAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS
 YEAR?
 THE '90s ARE BACK.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOVED THE
 '90s.
 I LOVED THE '90s.
 I WAS A LITTLE YOUNG, BUT HERE
 WE ARE.
 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO
 DRESS -WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU
 HOW TO DRESS FOR THE '90s TODAY.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
 YOU SAID, I WAS A LITTLE YOUNG
 IN THE '90s.
 I HAD A FULL-TIME JOB.
 COME ON, KATIE.
 CLOSE IT BACK A LITTLE.
 WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE '90s
 WHICH IS A GOOD TIME IF YOU
 DON'T REMEMBER.
 WHAT IS OUR FIRST LOOK?
 WELL, OUR FIRST LOOK IS A
 CARDIGAN.
 SO THE '90s WERE VERY BIG FOR
 CARDIGANS, BUT WE HAVE GOT AN
 UPDATED TWIST.
 I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO WEAR THEM
 AT ALL DIFFERENT AGES.
 WE'LL START WITH SHANTAY.
 SHE'S WEARING IT THE WAY
 JENNIFER ANISTON WORE IT
 IN "FRIENDS."
 BUTTONED DOWN AT THE TOP AND UP
 AT THE BOTTOM.
 YOU CAN WEAR IT WITH PRINTS,
 JEANS, WHATEVER.
 IT'S EASY.
 GIVE IT A TRY.
 THE ANIMAL PRINT KEEPS IT.
 THE ANIMAL PRINT IS REALLY
 CUTE.
 THEN WE HAVE GOT KATE WHO IS
 MODELING OUR 40s LOOK.
 THIS IS THE WAY THAT I'M
 CHOOSING TO WEAR CARDIGANS MOST
 OFTEN RECENTLY.
 YOU TUCK THEM INTO A LONG SKIRT
 AND IT CREATES SUCH A CUTE SHAPE
 FOR YOUR BODY.
 IT'S FLATTERING REALLY ON
 EVERYBODY, AND YOU JUST WEAR IT
 AS A TOP.
 SHE'S ALSO READY FOR VALENTINE'S
 DAY AND I WANT TO WEAR THAT
 OUTFIT.
 SHE HAS GOT TO BE READY
 BECAUSE THAT RING IS BLINDING
 ME.
 OH, I JUST SAW THAT.
 THANK YOU.
 MY HUSBAND WILL BE VERY
 THANKFUL.
 SHOUTOUT FOR HIM, RIGHT?
 AND SOME WOMEN IN THEIR 60s
 ARE REQUIRING A BIT MORE
 COVERAGE.
 SO FOR CAROL, WHAT WE HAVE DONE
 IS WE HAVE TAKEN THE LOOK OF A
 TURTLENECK UNDER A CARDIGAN.
 THAT'S CUTE WITH A SCARF.
 WITH A SCARF, RIGHT?
 THE SCARF SITS IN AS THE
 TURTLENECK AND WE PAIRED WIT --
 IT WITH A PUNCHY RED TOP AND
 SPORTY PANTS, AND CAROL IS GOING
 TO RIDE AROUND TOWN LOOKING
 CUTE.
 TOTALLY.
 YOU LOOK SO CUTE.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THANK YOU.
 SO WHAT IS -WHAT IS THE
 NEXT TREND?
 UP NEXT, WE HAVE GOT
 WIDE-LEGGED PANTS FOR EVERY AGE
 GROUP COMING AT YOU.
 I LOVE THAT.
 SO WIDE-LEGGED PANTS ARE NOW
 HOW YOU'RE PICTURING THEM.
 THEY'RE NOT GRUNGY.
 THEY'RE ACTUALLY SUPER CUTE
 BECAUSE THEY'RE CROPPED.
 WE'RE STARTING OFF WITH DANIELLA
 IN HER 20s.
 DANIELLA, IN YOUR 20s, IT'S A
 GREAT TIME TO PLAY WITH PRINT
 AND COLOR, BUT IF YOU ARE PETITE
 LIKE DANIELLA IS, YOU WON'T WANT
 TO WEAR PRINT HEAD TO TOE.
 WE HAVE KEPT THE PRINT IN THE
 PANT AND KEPT A SIMPLE TOP.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 SHE LOOKS GREAT.
 I LIKE IT.
 YOU MENTIONED THEY ARE ALL
 TOP.
 THAT'S THE DISTINCTION.
 THE CROP IS IN STYLE.
 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT MODERN.
 IN YOUR 40s, WE HAVE GOT GILLY,
 AND SHE IS WEARING A BOXY
 JACKET.
 IT HAS A THROWBACK, GRUNGE VIBE.
 BUT IT'S COOL.
 SEXY GRUNGE.
 DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE
 BORROWED IT FROM HER KID.
 IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S WEARING IT
 ON HER OWN.
 THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO
 BORROW IT FROM ME.
 THEY'LL WANT TO BORROW IT
 FROM YOU.
 EXACTLY.
 IT'S AN UPDATED MODERN GRUNGE
 FOR EVERYONE.
 AND THEN ARLENE IS IN HER 60s
 AND SOMETIMES AGAIN, WOMEN IN
 THEIR 60s ARE WANTING A BIT MORE
 COVERAGE.
 SO WE HAVE TAKEN THE WIDE-LEGGED
 PANT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE
 FLOOR, AND WE PAIRED IT WITH A
 BLAZER THAT'S GOING TO BRING IN
 HER WAIST AND IT'S SUCH A PRETTY
 COLOR AND SHE'S COVERED AND
 FEELING GOOD.
 THEY LOOK COMFORTABLE THOUGH.
 THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT
 LENGTHS.
 THEY ARE DIFFERENT LENGTHS
 AND IT VARIES DIFFERENT ON KIND
 OF HOW TALL YOU ARE, BUT REALLY
 THE OTHER THING ABOUT A
 WIDE-LEGGED PANT IS IT FEELS
 LIKE PAJAMAS.
 THAT'S WHY I'M ON BOARD WITH
 THE WIDE LEG.
 GET INTO A WIDE-LEGGED PANT
 AND FORGET YOUR WORRIES.
 I LOVE IT.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 YOU ALWAYS TEACH US SO MUCH.
 BRING EVERYBODY OUT.
 FOR A BREAKDOWN OF ALL OF
 THESE, CHECK OUT OUR INSTAGRAM
 PAGE.
 WE'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK.

      I work hard to protect           this Tookus.
       To take care of any        messy situations.
 And put irritation in its place.
   And if I can get comfortable
       keeping this Tookus      safe and protected...
  you can get comfortable doing       the same with yours.
          PREPARATION H.     Get comfortable with it.
