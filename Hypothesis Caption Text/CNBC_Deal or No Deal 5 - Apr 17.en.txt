It doesn't matter who you are. Anyone can play this game, and anyone can win $1 million. But I'm the only person who gets to do this. Ladies, please. <i> [dynamic music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Wow. Hello, ladies. all: Hello, Howie. 
- How are you? Okay. You ready? These cases need opening, and I just know the person to do it: Tony Oriente. How are you? How you doing? 
- I am great. 
- Good to meet you. 
- [inaudible]. Thank you. 
- Feel the love. How are you? 
- Howie, I am fantastic. I have been watching you for so many years. This is my all-time favorite game show. 
- Me too! 
- You are my all-time favorite game show host. 
- Whoa! 
- Yes! 
- Well, thank you. And you realize that this is Deal or No Deal. I'm noticing bingo, but, uh... 
- Yes. Actually, my favorite pastime is playing bingo. For many years I was a bingo caller. 
- Really? 
- Yes. So for fun, can I pick my cases with this? 
- You could do whatever you want. Tell me about you. 
- I'm from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, originally. Right now I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia with my husband of four years, Dewey Oriente. Love of my life. And we have three wonderful children. 
- Really? 
- We do. Yes. 
- That's wonderful. 
- We have Miss Sugar, who is a beautiful rag doll cat, we have Coconut and Monroe, which are 15-year-old Bichons, and I know that they're all watching. Hi. Hi. Hi. 
- [laughs] 
- Now that I've turned 50, right now, I am back in school. I've decided to get my degree in elementary education. 
- Wonderful. You ready to play? 
- I'm ready to play, Howie. 
- Oh, wow. 
- Yes! 
- Very good. You're terrific. I've only known you for moments, and you are probably one of the most lovable people I've ever met. You really are... 
- Thank you, Howie. 
- And we want things to happen for you. Okay, so this is how we do it. Each of the ladies are holding a case from 1 to 26. We know there's an amount of money in each case, packed there by a third party. We don't know what case is holding what amount. The only thing we do know is one of those cases is holding $1 million. [inaudible] All you have to do is pick the case that has a million in it. 
- When I worked at the bingo hall, I met a very, very fond woman. Her name is Jane. I'm picking one of her favorite lucky numbers. We're going for case number 24. That's Kizzi. Here you go. 
- [inaudible]. 
- You feel the millions in there? 
- There's something in there. 
- Well, that's... 
- [giggling] 
- It's something big. I know that. Something big. 
- All right. 
- Yes. 
- Well, hopefully it's the biggest, and the way we find out is by opening those. What's ever in those is not in yours. We're gonna start by opening up six cases, Tony. 
- Okay. Howie, did you ever play bingo before? 
- Many times. 
- Many times? 
- Yes. 
- I'm no good at it, but I'm... [laughing] Our first number up-
- if everybody has their cards ready, um... We have number 5. 
- Number 5 is Lani. Open your case. Small amount. That's okay. 
- Yes! That's okay. 
- That's good. 
- That's good. 
- That's good. 
- That's good. 
- That's good. Five more cases. 
- Yes. We're going no higher than that the rest of these picks. Here we go. The next number we've picked was 17. 
- 17. That's Ashley. Open your case. 
- Low, low, low, low, low, low, low. Yeah! [laughing] Whoo! 
- Four more. This is my favorite game. 
- Number 9. 
- That's Patricia. Open your case. 
- Small, Patricia. Small, small. 
- That's okay. That's okay. It really is, because you still have six of the top seven amounts still in play, including $1 million. 
- Yes! 
- Three more. 
- We have number 3. 
- 3. Katie. Open the case. 
- Yes! 
- Oh, my God. People who are just tuning in are going, What is this? 
- What is going on? Number 1. Yes! 
- Soraya. Open your case. 
- Yeah! Number 15. 
- How about that? That's Madi. 
- Hi, Madi. 
- Open your case. 
- Small. Small. Ah! 
- That was a good first round. Six out of the seven top amounts are still in play. 
- Whoo! 
- And I want to tell you something. You know, you sense it. When somebody comes up here and you talk to them, you can sense what kind of vibe they're giving out. This audience loves you. I would imagine, at home, people are just going, Wow. This guy's amazing. We want him to win money. There's only one person--I will tell you--there is one person that it's not about winning over, and that is that lady right there. That lady wants you to leave with as little as possible. She wants to buy that case from you right now for as little as possible. [phone ringing] She's about to make your first offer. Hello? She said she's having a little trouble reading you, you know? She said she can't tell. She wants to know, are you having a good time? 
- [laughing] Guys, are we all having a good time? Yes! 
- Good first round. Great first offer: Now, Tony, it's Deal or No Deal 2.0. There is one option. Once in the game, you can counter-offer. If she accepts it, she'll give you the money, you give her the case, and you go home. If she says no deal, you must play on. Five cases to open. So Tony... 
- Yes. 
- Oriente, deal or no deal? all: No deal! 
- Howie, $30,000 would get us to our dream home, which is our Golden Girls house in Florida that we really, really want. But we'd also like to add the lanai to it. So for the first time, I have to say: no deal. 
- Close the box. Wow. Top five amounts are still in play, from 300,000 all the way to a million. We will open five cases when you come back. <i> announcer: Tony's heart</i> <i> is catching on.</i> 
- How amazing is that? <i> announcer: And the offers</i> <i> are going up.</i> <i> Will the banker take control?</i>

- [laughs] 
- Should you walk out of here with a million dollars, what are the kind of things you want to do, Tony? 
- We are underwater in our mortgage from the 2008... 
- Bubble. 
- The bubble that went off. 
- Yes. 
- And we've lost our home... 
- Oh! 
- And we're actually in the process of moving right now into a new place, and it's okay, because it's a new beginning for us. 
- Right. 
- So we're going to turn this negative situation into a positive thing and just keep moving forward. 
- All right. Well, let's move forward. We have five cases to open.

- She's not happy. 
- She said you keep this up, you may become a platinum girl. 
- [laughing] Very real. Tony, I can see-
- I can see when I tell you these numbers, as much fun as we're having, this means a lot to you. You don't want to do this alone. 
- No. 
- You brought supporters. 
- I did. 
- Can I meet them? 
- Absolutely. 
- All right. 
- [laughing] 
- Oh, my. It's--I'm having déjà vu. [laughter] [stammering] Who are you? 
- Hi, Howie. I am Dewey. I am the husband. 
- The husband. Is this a coincidence? 
- No. It's in case we get separated, we can say, Did you see somebody that looks like me? 
- Aww! Do you always-
- [laughter] You always dress the same! That's amazing. all: Aww. 
- That was our wedding picture. 
- That's the wedding! 
- That's the wedding. 
- Yes. 
- Oh, wow. Congratulations. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
- All right, so tell me about Tony. 
- Okay, so we just celebrated our fourth anniversary. I always believed we are one person, and then we were separated, and we've spent our whole lives looking for our heart and soul, and that's him. 
- Aww. 
- Wonderful. Hello. 
- Hi, Howie. 
- Who are you? 
- I'm Rosemary, and I just wanted to let you know from the get-go that we are all criers. And... 
- So I've seen. 
- To prepare for today, Tony gave us each our own hankie. Our hearts are in this no matter what happens today. 
- Okay. 
- Our hearts are in this. 
- Wonderful. You're here for Tony. And who are you? 
- Hi. My name is Nicole. Tony has been my inspiration, my best buddy. He is so giving and so selfless, and I'm here to support you as you win $1 million! 
- All right. So come over here, Tony. 
- Yeah. 
- Okay. 
- Come over here. So you could talk to them. There's $52,000, guaranteed. 
- Okay. 
- There is an option of a counteroffer, which you can do, or you could just say no deal and go on and open up four more cases, so I'm gonna ask you, Tony Oriente... 
- Yes. 
- Deal or no deal? all: No deal! 
- So I'm the Sophia of the household-
- of The Golden Girls. I have to ask Dorothy. 
- Well, Ma, I think you should--I think you should continue to play this game. I say no deal. 
- By popular demand, no deal. 
- No deal. You just said no to $52,000. What does that feel like? 
- That's more than I would make in a year. That would help us so--that would help us tremendously, and I can't believe I just put that back. 
- It's okay. [excited chatter] 
- But you know what? 
- [inaudible]. 
- Let's look forward. Four cases to open. 
- My next one, then, is... 
- Okay. 
- Our anniversary. 
- Okay. That's Natasha. 
- Left. 
- Low! 
- Okay. 
- Go left.

ORILISSA is specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. In clinical trials, ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 common types of endometriosis pain, painful periods, pelvic pain in between periods, and pain with sex. Don't use ORILISSA if you are or may be pregnant, have osteoporosis, severe liver disease, or are taking drugs like cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. It may cause abnormal liver tests. ORILISSA may change your periods, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. It does not prevent pregnancy. Use birth control that does not contain hormones. ORILISSA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. It may also cause bone loss. Ask your gynecologist if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA. Made for endo pain.

- Okay. Welcome back to Deal or No Deal. I'm standing with Tony Oriente, a husband, a teacher, one of the most fun contestants we've ever had on this show. You really are. You want your future. You want your dream home. That was a tough round. 
- That was a very tough round. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 
- Still, when you look at it, there's only eight cases left in play. You have a one-in-four chance of walking out of here with at least $1/2 million. [phone ringing] <i> [tense music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Hello? Right. All right. You knocked out a big amount. 
- Yes. 
- What do you think, Tony, that did to your offer? 
- I believe my offer went down. [laughs] Down. 
- The new offer is $69,000. Talk to me for a second what that would mean in your life right now. 
- That is the student loans gone. That is the down payment on the house. That is exactly what I could use to get the third length of my life started. 
- If you decide to go on, you must open up two more cases. 
- Okay. 
- Talk about this. 
- I think he's right. I also think that I know that he likes to take risks, and I'm okay with that. I believe there's magic in that number 24 case. 
- I'm trying to leave here knowing a millionaire, and since that moment has passed, I will settle for... 
- A somewhat millionaire. 
- 3/4 of one. I say no deal and go for it. 
- Okay. All right. Tony Oriente... Deal or no deal? 
- Hmm. [all shouting] 
- Howie, when I look at the board, I have two cases that I have to open. I have a 50-50 chance of hitting one of those big amounts-
- the 500 or the 750,000-
- but that would leave me still one of them in play. I don't want to make a counteroffer as of yet. No deal. 
- No deal. Close the box. 
- No deal! 
- Two cases to open. Two cases to open. 
- Yes. 
- Scared? 
- I'm very scared right now. 
- I'm scared for you. 
- Yes. 
- All right. Start picking a case. 
- There's no cases here. [laughter] 
- I was wondering that myself. 
- What happened? 
- Where are they at? 
- I don't know. You know how to get them out here. 
- I do. 
- What do you say? 
- Ladies, please! <i> [dynamic music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Yes! <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- Here's looking at you. You know, it's amazing, I got to say. There is a feeling, even backstage, that you have energized. Everybody is at the monitors. Everybody wants you to win. Everybody wants just to be a part of it. So let's keep that positive energy going. 
- Absolutely. 
- Are you gonna keep going with the bingo? 
- I absolutely am. 
- So you have two cases to open. 
- Yes. 
- Pick a case. 
- All right, Tony. You got it. 
- Number 23. 
- Okay. That's Anne Julia.

- That's great. That's great. 
- Thank you! 
- One more. 
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
- Okay. This is the last case to open in this round. What is that case number? 
- It's my birthday: 20. 
- That's Amanza. This is a crucial case. It is time to see what is in Amanza's case. Is it gonna be positive? Is it gonna be negative? We cannot break that net. We need the penny. Amanza, it is up to you. 
- I want to say I know how scary it is to go through change and to kind of start over. I just recently went through something like that myself. The day I moved into my new apartment, I found out that Deal or No Deal was coming back, and I got on the show, and it changed my life, and I think it's about to change yours. 
- Open your case. all: Penny. Penny! Penny! 
- Here I go. all: Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! [all screaming] 
- Oh, wow. This is getting bigger. It's getting better. Huge money in. You are about to get a huge offer. You're very emotional. So is everybody. You don't want to miss this. Call your friends. Call your neighbors. Turn on CNBC right now. 
- Wait, guys. Stop, stop, stop. Check it out. Right over there. One donut. That's it. Just one donut. Come on. <i> announcer: For Tony,</i> <i> a Voodoo Doughnuts offer</i> <i> is an automatic deal.</i>

- Tony Oriente just said it to me. I'm gonna say it to you. Wow. This is a husband. This is a teacher. He's about to get a big offer. That board is amazing. Two huge amounts still remain in play. We're about to get an offer, and... 
- Ooh. 
- We're at the part of the game where if you continue to go on, it is one case at a time. 
- [chuckles nervously] Hello? <i> [tense music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Last time, you had a one-in-four chance of walking out of here with at least $1/2 million, right? 
- Yes. 
- I told you that last time. 
- Yes. 
- And now, you have a one-in-three chance of walking out of here with 1/2 million. The offers just went to the next level. Six figures. 
- [chortling] 
- I have two words: safety net. Safety net. No deal. 
- You can also counter-offer. 
- Yes. 
- If she says no deal, the money's off the table, and you still open one more case. Tony Oriente, deal or no deal? all: No deal! 
- No deal! 
- Wow. 
- All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. 
- I just turned down $136,000! 
- Spin the ball! 
- Do it! Do it! 
- Spin the ball! 
- Do it! 
- Do it, baby! 
- Spin it! 
- You know why you did that? You know why you did that? 
- Spin it! 
- For a chance to make your dream come true. 
- Yes. 
- It's tough. 
- It is tough. 
- But good things are hard to get. You work hard, and it's a lot sweeter. 
- Just four. 
- One case to open. 
- Let's do this. 
- Yes. 
- Okay. 
- Yes. Number 2. 
- Okay. Taylor. You saw Tony's tears. You saw Tony's angst. Because Tony knows, more than anybody in this room, one case can either skyrocket the next offer... or cut the safety net. This case is more important than any other case up until this time in the game. Taylor, let's find that dollar. Open the case. 
- Find that dollar. 
- Tony, just in the short time that I've known you, you are one of the most deserving and humble people that I've met, and we're all here with you right now, and there's nothing that I'd rather do than open up a low number right now. 
- Come on. all: Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! 
- Aw. 
- It's okay. 
- That's okay. 
- It's okay. 
- Okay. 
- That was a big hit, 'cause now there is no longer a safety net. In order to find out if this has the $1/2 million, you're going to have to continue to turn down offers, and you're gonna have to go all the way. Does it have the 1/2 million? Is it worth waiting for? We're all gonna have to find out if that $1/2 million is there. Wait. We're going to break, and we'll be back with more Deal or No Deal when you return.

- Welcome back to Deal or No Deal. Tony Oriente is looking for his Golden Girl home, which is still possible. There's an offer coming up. In the last round, the biggest amount was knocked out. There is still $1/2 million on the board. One case to open at a time. 
- Okay. 
- Odds are you'll open smaller amounts. How are you feeling? 
- I need a little recharge right now, Howie, so I have a favor to ask. 
- Go ahead. 
- I'd like to go up there and hang with the pretty girls just for a moment and hang with the models so we can all share our outfit. 
- Let's do it. 
- Can my husband join me too? 
- Go ahead. 
- Go, go, go. 
- Aww, hi. 
- Whoo-hoo! 
- [laughs] You guys remind me of the Care Bears. [laughter] 
- They do. 
- Ooh! 
- Uh-oh. 
- Okay. Hello? <i> [tense music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Right. Right. I know. She said you're lovely, but this is business. 
- Ooh. Ooh! Okay. 
- All right. It dropped. 
- Yes. 
- Significantly. 
- Ooh. 
- Almost in half. $71,000. $71,000 is a lot of money. One case to open. You have a four-out-of-five chance of opening anything but the 1/2 million, but if you hit the 1/2 million, the most you can go home with is 50,000. The banker wants to know, do you have the guts? Do you have the guts to go on? 
- Yes, he has the guts. Sorry, honey. You are certainly no match for my husband. 
- That's right. Yes! 
- That being said, $71,000 is a lot of money. What are you telling him to do? 
- I think now it's time for the counteroffer. 
- So you realize you have to make a counter that is reasonable. 
- Yes. 
- Because she, like yourself, is just looking at the boards. She is looking at the odds. Tony Oriente, deal or no deal? all: No deal! 
- Banker, there's five cases left up there. If you averaged out five cases, it would be $100,000 is the average for all of it, and I would like to make a counteroffer for $100,000. 
- Up until now, the game has totally been in your hands. 
- Yes. 
- And now you have just handed control over to the banker. It is up to her to listen to your reasoning. The decision is all hers. The game is yours. [phone ringing] <i> [tense music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Are you ready to hear the answer? 
- I'm ready. 
- Hello? <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Okay. All right. She said that's a very close call. Based on emotion, that's a good offer, right? 
- Yes. 
- That's what she said. This is not about emotion. This is about business. 
- This is business. 
- She says no deal. all: Awww. 
- It's all right. 
- All right. 
- Okay. 
- It's all right. 
- It's okay, baby. 
- One case. 
- One case. We're gonna do this. 
- We're gonna do it. 
- Baby, come on, come on... 
- Number 21. 
- Malika. All right. Let it be a dollar. Let it be a penny. Anything but the $1/2 million. Let's feel it. Open the case. Come on. Come on. Come on. [all groan] 
- It's all good. It's all good. 
- All good. 
- You know, this game plays a big psychological game. 
- Yes. 
- When you see big amounts, huge amounts of money don't matter to people anymore, but the truth is, you have a one-out-of-four chance of walking out of here with $50,000. 
- Yes! 
- 50,000. Hello? Okay. Way down, but still a lot of money. 
- Okay. $10,000 is a guarantee. One case to open. Tony Oriente, deal or no deal? 
- No deal. No deal. 
- Might as well play it out. 
- No deal! 
- Oh, my gosh. One case to open. 
- All right. Brittany, open the case. 
- Low! Oh! 
- It's okay. It's okay. [phone ringing] 
- Hello? Okay. 
- Oh. Tony Oriente, deal or no deal? 
- No deal! 
- No deal. 
- Pick a case. Oh, my gosh. 
- Michelle, open your case. 
- Yes! 
- The final offer. The final offer is--okay. All right. $70. Tony Oriente, deal or no deal? 
- Ehh. 
- Deal! 
- Deal. You're taking $70. Her case had the penny! The penny was there. Open your case. Tony Oriente could not find the end of the rainbow
