 WE WILL TIME-OUT HOUR BY
 HOUR WHEN SNOW COMES IN AND
 WHEN IT TURNS TO SLEET AND
 FREEZING RAIN.
 JUST A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
 CHILDREN OH SO SCARRED BY THIS
 CRIME.
 DO YOU THINK BRYCE HARPER IS
 COMING BACK.
 PART OF ME SAYS NO AND PART
 OF ME SAYS YES.
 GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.
 I SAT DOWN WITH NOTED SCHOLAR
 AND JESUIT PRIEST FATHER THOMAS
 READ EARLIER FOR AN
 CONVERSATION ABOUT SEX ABUSE IN
 THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
 FIRST WE NEED TO BRING YOU UP-
 TO-DATE ON THE WEATHER.
 A RED WEATHER ALERT's BEE
 SNOWFALL TOTALS A LITTLE BIT
 DOESN'T DIMINISH THE IMPACT OF
 THE STORM.
 THIS HAS ELEMENTS THAT ARE
 DANGEROUS WITH SLEET AND
 FREEZING RAIN.
 GAITHERSBURG, WURZBURG, WURZBURG
 , HAGERSTOWN TO THE MOUNTAINS,
 1 -THREE IMMEDIATE METRO, D.C.,
 CHEVY CHASE, BETHESDA AND
 SOUTH.
 NOT AS MUCH.
 TRACED TO AN INCH.
 COLD AIR LACKING A BIT.
 THE ROAD IS GOING TO BE A
 DISASTER TO GET INTO WEDNESDAY
 MORNING.
 RPM UP TO ITS OLD TRICKS AGAIN,
 7 INCHES EVERYONE ELSE HAS A
 GRASP ON REALITY  2 3 INCHES.
 WE KNOW THAT SNOWFALL WILL BE
 MODERATE TO HEAVY 6:00 A.M.
 TO NOON AND ROADS WILL BECOME
 TREACHEROUS AND WHEN IT STARTS
 IT WILL PICK UP IN INTENSITY,
 QUICKLY AND ACCUMULATE QUICKLY.
 SNOW WILL GO TO A MIX NORTHWEST
 IN THE AFTERNOON AND RAIN D.C.
 SELF IN EAST IN THE AFTERNOON.
 IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THE DAY
 IT WILL TURN ALL RAIN MIGHT
 TOMORROW NIGHT AFTER MORNING
 SHOWERS ON THURSDAY.
 LOOK HOW MUCH MOISTURE IS
 HEADED OUR WAY.
 IF THE SYSTEM WERE 300 MILES
 OFF TO THE EAST COULD BE
 LOOKING AT A BLIZZARD BUT WE
 ARE NOT.
 5:00 A.M.
 A LITTLE SNOW BREAKING OUT
 PARTS OF THE METRO TEMPS UPPER
 20s LOW 30s BECOMES HEAVY TO
 MODERATE ACROSS THE ENTIRE
 METRO BY 7:00 ON WEDNESDAY.
 TEMPS 2930 DEGREES.
 10:00 HEAVY SNOW ACROSS THE
 METRO AND IT BEGINS TO MIX AND
 CHANGE AROUND THE LUNCH HOUR.
 WHEN WE COME BACK WE WILL TALK
 ABOUT HOW MUCH ICE WILL
 ACCUMULATE AND WHO IS MOST MOST
 LIKELY TO HAVE A POWER OUTAGE.
 IF MANNY MACHADO IS GETTING
 300 MILLION WHAT WILL BRYCE
 HARPER GET?
 MACHADO HAS AGREED TO SIGN WITH
 THE SAN DIEGO PADRES REPORTEDLY
 WORTH $300 MILLION OVER TEN
 YEARS.
 THE DEAL PENDING RESULTS OF THE
 PHYSICAL.
 THE FORMER BALTIMORE OREO SAID
 THE L.A.
 DODGERS INFIELDER IS SET TO
 PLAY 3rd  BASE.
 NOW THE ATTENTION TURNS TO
 BRYCE HARPER.
 SPECULATION ALL OVER SOCIAL
 MEDIA.
 WILL HE RE-SIGN WITH THE
 NATIONALS?
 MOST DON'T THINK SO.
 LATEST RUMORS HAVING GOING TO
 PHILADELPHIA.
 THE PLAYERS ALREADY IN SPRING
 TRAINING CAMP IN FLORIDA.
 BUT DARREN HAYNES SAT DOWN WITH
 DAVEY MARTINEZ TO TALK ABOUT IT

 Reporter: HOW MUCH YOU WANT
 PRICE ON YOUR TEAM?
 GREECE AND I HAVE A SPECIAL
 RELATIONSHIP.
 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
 WHO WOULDN'T WANT BRYCE HARPER
 ON YOUR TEAM?
 HONESTLY?
 ONE OF THE BEST YOUNG PLAYERS
 IN THE GAME.
 AND FOR ME IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT
 HE WANTS. FOR HIS FAMILY AND
 HIS CAREER.
 IT REALLY IS.
 HE'S GOT BIG DECISIONS TO MAKE.
 I WOULD BE WRONG TO SAY THAT OF
 COURSE, ANYBODY WOULD WANT HIM
 ON HIS TEAM.
 IF BRYCE DECIDED I'M COMING
 BACK TO THE NATIONALS, WHAT
 WOULD BE YOUR REACTION IF HE
 WALKED IN THE DOOR?
 WELCOME BACK.
 THAT'S IT?
 TIME TO WORK.
 GO TO WORK.
 DO YOU THINK BRYCE HARPER IS
 GOING BACK?
 PART OF ME SAYS NO, PART OF
 ME SAYS YES.
 THE WAY THIS GAME IS YOU DON'T
 KNOW.
 YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW.
 Reporter: WHICH WAY ARE YOU
 LEANING?
 HONESTLY, LIKE I SAID, I
 CAN'T LEAN EITHER WAY.
 IT IS SO WEIRD BECAUSE, YOU
 KNOW?
 LIKE I SAID I TRIED TO SAY HEY,
 YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS WHAT
 I'VE GOT TO DO TODAY.
 I'VE GOT TO LEAD 59 GUYS
 TOMORROW MORNING, GET UP AT 6:00
 , GET TO THE BALLPARK AND GET
 THE DAY GOING.
 MY FOCUS IS ON THE DAY AT HAND,
 THE HERE AND NOW AND THAT IS
 WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
 EAT YOUR FOOD, MAN.
 IS MARTINEZ PLAYING US?
 HOW DOES HE NOT KNOW?

 I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOES.
 I THINK THERE IS A BIG QUESTION
 MARK IT.
 MANNY MACHADO JUST SIGNED FOR
 THE LARGEST FREE-AGENT DEAL IN
 THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN SPORTS,
 SUCH AS BASEBALL.
 THERE IS BIG PRESSURE ON
 BRYCE'S AGENT TO GO AT LEAST 1
 DOLLAR OVER THAT.
 THE NATIONALS HAVE OFFERED 300
 MILLION.
 I DON'T KNOW IF THE OFFER IS
 THERE ANYMORE.
 WHAT DAVEY MARTINEZ IS THINKING,
 AS TED LERNER BROKE HIS
 PENDENCY WITH SCOTT MORRISON
 ONLY HAS A BUNCH OF CLIENTS
 BEFORE, CAN HE SAY NO TO HIM
 THIS TIME?
 I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE
 QUESTION.
 PERSONALLY I WANT BRYCE TO
 STAY.
 HE IS STAR POWER.
 RELAX STARS.
 WITH JERSEYS ON THE BACK
 THAT SORT OF THING.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 MY GUT IS THE PHILLIES WILL
 OFFER SOMETHING SO ENORMOUS,
 ONE PERSON SAID NINE YEARS,
 $367 MILLION, I DON'T KNOW IF
 THAT WILL HAPPEN OR NOT.
 I KNOW THAT THE NATIONALS WILL
 BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO COUNTER.
 I JUST CAN'T.
 BASED ON PAYROLL, BASED ON WHAT
 THEY HAVE COMMITTED ALREADY BUT
 I DON'T KNOW.
 THAT COULD BE A WILDCARD.
 THE NATS HAVE SOMEONE IN
 BRYCE'S POSITION RIGHT NOW.
 DOES THAT MATTER?
 ROBLES, SOTO, DEFINITELY
 GOING TO TAKE HIS SPOT AT THE
 PLAY.
 THEY ARE GOING TO BE BRYCE
 HARPER.
 BRYCE HARPER WAS A LIVE WIRE, A
 HAND GRENADE.
 YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHEN HE WOULD
 EXPLODE.
 THE MOST EXCITING THING IN
 SPORTS.
 THEY ALREADY BRING THOUSANDS
 OF FANS HERE EVERY TIME THEY
 PLAY.
 PHILLIES FANS ARE THE WORST.
 I LOVE YOU, I KNOW YOU, I WORKED
 YOU BUT PHILLIES FANS OF THE
 WORST.
 THE SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDAL
 THAT HAS SHAKEN THE CATHOLIC
 CHURCH AT ITS CORE.
 FOR US IT STARTS HERE IN
 WASHINGTON D.C. FOR FORMER
 CARDINAL AND ARCHBISHOP
 THEODORE DID -PETER MCCARRICK
 HAS BEEN DEFROCKED BY THE POPE
 LIVING IN A REMOTE MONASTERY
 SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDWEST.
 THEY ARE REPORTING CHILDREN
 WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED FOR YEARS
 BY PRIESTS WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN
 CARING FOR THEM.
 YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT POPE
 FRANCIS HAS CALLED THE SUMMIT.
 WE ARE TALKING WITH A NOTED
 JESUIT PRIEST AND SCHOLAR. TELL
 ME WHY YOU WERE GOING TO ROME
 RIGHT NOW?
 I AM GOING TO ROME BECAUSE
 THE POPE HAS CALLED A MEETING
 OF TOP BISHOPS FROM AROUND THE
 WORLD TO COME AND TALK TO HIM
 ABOUT THE SEX ABUSE CRISIS. HE
 WANTS TO EMPHASIZE TO THEM HOW
 IMPORTANT IT IS AND THEIR
 RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK HE
 IS GOING TO MAKE THE POINT THAT
 IF THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE HE
 WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
 THIS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT
 MEETING FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
 BECAUSE THE FIRST MEETINGS LIKE
 THIS THAT IS EVER HAPPENED.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
 HEADLINES.
 JUST TODAY THE WASHINGTON POST
 IS REPORTING THAT DEAF CHILDREN
 WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED BY PRIESTS
 IN ARGENTINA.
 IS THIS GOING TO COME UP IN
 ROME?
 THIS IS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
 CHILDREN ARE SO SCARRED BY THIS
 CRIME, THIS ABUSE THAT THEY
 SUFFER UNDER.
 THAT IS WHY THE CHURCH HAS TO
 HAVE A POLICY TO DEAL WITH IT.
 UNITED STATES WE HAVE 0 POLICY
 ON ABUSE OF CHILDREN. IN THE
 CHURCH WE HAD THIS POLICY OF
 ZERO-TOLERANCE SO ANY PRIEST
 INVOLVED IN ABUSED IS REMOVED
 FROM THE PRIESTHOOD.
 THE SECOND PART IS TO MAKE SURE
 ALL BISHOPS IMPLEMENT THIS
 POLICY.
 THAT IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE AT
 THIS MEETING.
 TALK TO ME ABOUT THE APPARENT
 HYPOCRISY IN ALL THIS.
 IT HAS COME OUT TODAY IN A NEW
 YORK TIMES ARTICLE THAT THE
 VATICAN HAS A BOOK, HAS RULES
 ON WHAT TO DO WITH CHILDREN WHO
 ARE BOTHERED BY PRIESTS?
 WHO KNEW?
 ACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT
 THE DOCUMENT AND REPORTS I HAVE
 SEEN THE EMPHASIS ON THE
 PRIEST'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS
 CHILD.
 POPE FRANCIS SAID THIS IN THE
 PAST, HE SAID IT BEFORE HE
 BECAME POPE AND THAT IS IF A
 PRIEST FATHER'S A CHILD THAN HE
 HAS A RESPONSIBILITY AS A FATHER
 , FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND
 JUST AS A FATHER THE PATERNAL
 RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT
 RESPONSIBILITY PRECEDES HIS
 RESPONSIBILITY TO BE A PRIEST.
 HE SHOULD LEAVE THE PRIESTHOOD
 AND RAISE THE CHILD.
 COMING UP MY CONVERSATION
 CONTINUES.
           Z35WDZ Z16FZ
           Y35WDY Y16FY
 THE POPE HAS SUMMONED CHURCH
 LEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
 TO MEET AT THE VATICAN. WILL
 THEY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF
 PRIESTS?
 LET'S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION
 WITH FATHER THOMAS READ.
 THIS PART OF THE CONNECTION
 WASN'T AS CLEAR BUT -WHAT
 ABOUT THE ISSUE OF PRIESTS?
 I WAS IN THE SEMINARY 100
 YEARS AGO 13 GUYS IN MY CLASS
 ONLY ONE BECAME A PRIEST.
 I KNOW THAT JOHN WAS.
 WE HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG THERE
 ARE PRIESTS.
 IF IT WERE UP TO A LOT OF
 CATHOLICS THERE WOULD BE OPENLY
 PRIESTS, THERE WOULD BE WOMEN
 PRIESTS, THERE WOULD BE MARRIED
 PRIESTS WHO COULD HAVE
 CHILDREN.
 WHEN IS THE CHURCH GOING TO
 COME TO THIS OR IS THIS WISHFUL
 THINKING?
 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
 THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF
 WONDERFUL PRIESTS IN THE
 PRIESTHOOD.
 PRIESTS WHO OBSERVE THEIR VOW
 OF CELIBACY AND ARE VERY GOOD
 PASTORAL PRIESTS.
 WE DON'T WANT TO MIX UP THE
 ISSUE OF PRIESTS WITH THE ISSUE
 OF SEXUAL ABUSE.
 OF MINORS.
 AND THAT CHECKPOINT NEEDS TO BE
 MADE.
 BUT I AGREE WITH YOU, I THINK
 WE NEED FOR HONESTY IN THE
 CHURCH.
 FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. BISHOPS
 HAVE NEVER LOVED ANYBODY TO
 SURVEY PRIESTS TO FIND OUT WHAT
 PERCENTAGE ARE.
 WE HAVE ESTIMATES FROM TEN

 ALL OVER THE PLACE.
 NOBODY HAS ANY REAL DATA.
 THE ONE FACT WE DO KNOW IF
 THERE ARE PRIESTS MOST OF THEM
 ARE GOOD PRIESTS WHO OBSERVE
 THEIR PROMISE OF CELIBACY AND
 ARE GOOD FOR THE CHURCH.
 DO YOU EXPECT ANYTHING TO
 COME OF THIS MEETING OR IS THIS
 GOING TO BE MORE
 WINDOWDRESSING?
 I THINK MOST AMERICANS ARE
 GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED WITH
 THIS MEETING BECAUSE WE WOULD
 LIKE TO SEE POLICIES AND
 PROCEDURES SET UP, STRUCTURES
 TO HOLD BISHOPS ACCOUNTABLE.
 I THINK THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
 IS THIS MEETING IS PRIMARILY FOR
 OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE BISHOPS
 ARE IN TOTAL DENIAL.
 THEY DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THIS
 PROBLEM.
 THEY THINK THIS IS AN AMERICAN
 PROBLEM.
 IN THE MESSAGE WE WANT TO TAKE
 IS DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES
 THE AMERICAN BISHOPS DID.
 GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER. MOVED
 THE BAD PRIESTS AND HELP THE
 VICTIMS IN HEALING.
 IT IS NOT JUST THE PRIESTS.
 WE'RE SEEING THEATER MCCARRICK
 RIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON WHO
 HAS BECOME THE POSTER CHILD FOR
 THIS KIND OF ABUSE.
 NOT JUST PRIESTS, THE BISHOPS
 ARE BEING ASKED TO POLICE
 THEMSELVES ARE THEY NOT?
 NO I THINK THIS IS VERY
 IMPORTANT.
 AND NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH HE
 WAS A RETIRED BISHOP THEY
 BROUGHT THE INFORMATION TO THE
 VATICAN AND THE VATICAN SAID
 OKAY TREAT HIM JUST LIKE YOU
 WOULD A PRIEST OF THE
 ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK.
 HIS CASE WAS INVESTIGATED, THEY
 HIRED A FORENSIC RESEARCH TEAM,
 THE INFORMATION PRESENTED AND
 THE ACCUSATIONS WERE CREDIBLE,
 SUBSTANTIATED AND HE WAS REMOVED
 AND HE REFINED A NOW REMOVED
 FROM THE PRIESTHOOD.
 HE IS NO LONGER BISHOP
 MCCARRICK IS MR. MCCARRICK.
 HE WILL NEVER BE A PRIEST
 AGAIN.
 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD
 HAPPEN.
 GOOD LUCK ON YOUR TRIP WE
 LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING
 REPORTS.
  THANK YOU.
 GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
 WASHINGTON'S CURRENT
 ARCHBISHOP IS OBVIOUSLY
 LEAVING.
 WE DON'T HAVE ANY WORD TONIGHT.
 IF YOU MISSED PART ONE OF OUR
 INTERVIEW, BOTH WILL BE POSTED
 ON WUSA9.COM AFTER THIS
 BROADCAST.
 IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION
 . MAKE SURE TO CHECK IT OUT.
 COMING UP A RED WEATHER ALERT
 FOR TOMORROW, THE LATEST
 TIMELINE ON
 LOOKING FOR A RED WEATHER
 ALERT FOR SNOW AND SLEET AND
 FREEZING RAIN.
 HERE IS A LOOK AT THE SNOWFALL
 MAP. 3 5 LEESBURG,
 GAITHERSBURG OR FREDERICKSBURG.
 IN THE METRO  1 3, LOWER THAN
 YESTERDAY.
 IS TAKING MORE SLEEP.
 LET US KNOW INTO SOUTHERN
 MARYLAND TRACE TO AN INCH
 THERE.
 NOTICE THE PLUS SIGN SOME OF
 YOU COULD GET CONCEIVABLY OVER
 5 INCHES WHICH IS GOING TO BE A
 PROBLEM. WORRIED ABOUT THAT ONE
 BACK TO THIS THE SECOND.
 WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH SOME
 THINGS TO GET TO SUNDAY.
 GFS EUROPEAN MODEL PRETTY MUCH
 IN AGREEMENT WITH US AROUND 3
 INCHES.
 SEEMS REASONABLE.
 FROM WICHITA, KANSAS TO CAPE
 HATTERAS SNOW EXTENDING UP IN
 THE IOWA AND SOUTH DAKOTA AND
 NEBRASKA I RESERVE THESE FOR
 SNOW BECAUSE IF IT IS LEGITIMATE
 ON THE FRONT AND IN TERMS OF
 IMPACT WE KNOW IT'S COMING
 HOPEFULLY FOLKS WILL STAY OFF
 THE ROAD BUT NONETHELESS STILL
 GIVE IT 3.5 IN THE IMPACT AS
 WELL.
 CERTAINLY A LEGITIMATE STORM.
 I HAVE UPDATED THIS ON OUR
 WEBSITE.
 IN TERMS OF POWER OUTAGES,
 ISOLATED ALONG I-95 AND POINTS
 WEST, UNLIKELY EAST AND
 SCATTERED OUT IN CUMBERLAND,
 HAGERSTOWN. EVEN WHERE ICING
 WILL OCCUR, 3 INCHES OF SNOW IN
 D.C., PLAIN OLD-FASHIONED RAIN
 WILL ADD TO THE WEIGHT OF THE
 SNOW AND COULD BRING DOWN THOSE
 AS WELL.
 MACY POWER OUTAGES NOT CONFINED
 TO JUST AREAS WITH ICE.
 THIS IS ONE MODEL, MOST EYES
 FOR THE WEST AND NOT THAT BAD.
 GAITHERSBURG THREE TENTHS AND
 CAN PROBABLY HANDLE IT.
 NOW ALMOST AN INCH THREE TENTHS
 LEESBURG, GAITHERSBURG THAT
 WOULD CAUSE POWER OUTAGES.
 WE START OUT WITH PEERS SNOW.
 BUT THIS COLUMN OF AIR IS BELOW
 FREEZING.
 THAN WE GET WARM AIR AS IT
 MOVES IN TO THE ATMOSPHERE
 BECOME SLEET. FREEZING RAIN IS
 WHAT WE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT
 , FALLS LIQUID BUT FREEZES ON
 CONTACT.
 WE ADJUSTED THE TIME A BIT.
 HEAVY SNOW 6:00 A.M.
 TO NOON.
 ROADS WILL BECOME DANGEROUS.
 THEY BECOME INTENSE QUICKLY AND
 ACCUMULATE QUICKLY.
 WE WILL GO TO MIX NORTH AND
 WEST IN THE AFTERNOON.
 RAIN D.C. SOUTH AND EAST IN THE
 AFTERNOON.
 HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT
 AND SHOWERS IN THE 50s ON
 THURSDAY.
 6:00 A.M.
 TOMORROW SNOW ACROSS MOST OF
 THE METRO.
 THE DARK OF THE BLUE HEAVIER
 SNOW.
 9:00 NO DOUBT BUT IT BEGINS TO
 TURN AS WE GET TOWARDS THE
 LUNCH HOUR ESPECIALLY DOWN TO
 THE SOUTH PLAIN OLD RAIN D.C.
 SOUTH AND EAST BY 3:00.
 SOME LINGERING FREEZING RAIN
 NORTH AND WEST UNTIL THE
 EVENING.
 HERE WE GO RED ALERT WEDNESDAY
 56 MORNING SHOWERS THURSDAY AND
 NICE ON FRIDAY.
 IN TERMS OF SNOW ONCE AGAIN
 LOOKING AT  3 5 NORTH AND WEST
 AND  1 3 IN THE METRO AND
 TREES TO AN INCH
 THE CAUSE OF THE WINTER
 WEATHER, THE WASHINGTON TEAM
 WILL BE ON EARLY TOMORROW WITH
 THE LATEST ON CONDITIONS AND
 CLOSINGS.
