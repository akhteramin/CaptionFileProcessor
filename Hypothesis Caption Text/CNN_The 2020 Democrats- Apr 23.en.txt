     So, you're open all day,            every day.
  That's what 24/7 means, sugar.
       Kind of like how you         get 24/7 access
  to licensed agents with GEICO.
               Hmm?
    Yeah, you just go online,
   or give them a call anytime.
          You don't say.
    Yep. Now what will it take        to get 24/7 access
   to that lemon meringue pie?
               PIE!
 PIE'S COMING!
   That's what it takes, baby.
      <i> GEICO®. Great service</i>   <i> from licensed agents, 24/7.</i>
 THE 2020 DEMOCRATS, AMERICA HILL, THANKS FOR JOINING US.
 WE'RE SEEING THINGS WRAP UP
 THERE IN MANCHESTER, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG,
 TAKING SELFIES, THE HOUR AHEAD
 COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF CNN'S
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL TOWN
 HALL, FIVE CANDIDATES FOR
 PRESIDENT ANSWERING THOSE
 QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE,
 WHICH AS WE SAID WAS MADE UP OF
 STUDENTS, COLLEGE AGED VOTERS
 PRESSING THESE DEMOCRATS ON A
 VARIETY OF TOPICS, HEALTH CARE,
 STUDENT DEBT, CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 REFORM, CLIMATE CH SENATORS AMY
 KLOBUCHAR, ELIZABETH WARREN,
 BERNIE SANDERS, KAMALA HARRIS
 AND MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG LEAVING
 THE STAGE A FEW MINUTES AGO.
 HOW DID THEY DO?
 LET'S CHECK IN IN■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
 NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 MALIKA HENDERSON AND DAVID
 GOOD TO HAVE YOU ALL WITH US
 TONIGHT, A LOT OF ENERGY, DAVID
 CHALIAN, IN THAT ROOM,CH
 THEY■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
 TO YOU FROM THESE CANDIDATES
 TONIGHT?
 THERE WERE A FEW THINGS THAT
 STOOD OUT, ERICA, YOU MENTIONED
 THEM IN SOME OF THE TOPICS.
 I THOUGHT THE ANSWERS ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT, POST MUELLER REPORT
 RELATING TO THE PRESIDENT REALLY
 INTERESTING BECAUSE IT SEEMS
 LIKE THERE'S A GROWING CHORUS
 INSIDE THIS DEMOCRATIC
 NOMINATING CONTEST FIELD THAT WE
 HAVE OF THESE CANDIDATES FOR THE
 IDEA OF THE HOUSE MOVING ALONG
 IN THAT DIRECTION AT THE VERY
 SAME TIME THAT NANCY PELOSI IS
 SORT OF TRYING TO CAMP THAT
 DOWN.
 I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING
 TO HEAR KAMALA HARRIS AND PETE
 BUTTIGIEG ADVANCE.
 I THOUGHT THERE WERE SURPRISES
 IN THE NIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS
 TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
 FELONS CURRENTLY SERVING THEIR
 PRISON TERMS IN PRISON SHOULD BE
 OF■■■■■EBATE IN THIS ##■■■■■ F■P
 DING##■
 OVERALL, I THINKERE RIGHT,

 VOTERS, AHINK THIS■■■1Y TO THES
 TO SPEAK TO■■■■■■■ AUDIENC■■■■

 WINNING COALITION# ■■■■ THE■##■
 TOPICS FRONT O THEIR MIND WAS
 IMPORTANT FOR THESE■■TES
 TO DO.
 CERTAINLY HEARD THA■■ IN
 SOME OF THE
 KLING IT VERY CLEAR
 THAT WAS THE YOUTH, SHE SAID,
 THEIR MOMENT THAT THEY GOT
 DEMOCRATS THERE IN NOVEMBER.
 I WANT TO PICK UP, THOUGH, ON
 IMPEACHMENT, NIA-MALIKA, EACH
 CANDIDATE WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT,
 TO GET THROUGH THE ISSUES ON THE
 CAMPAIGN TRAIL THEY HAVE TO GET
 THROUGH THE QUESTIONS WHETHER
 THEY WANT TO OR NOT.
 WHAT SENATOR WARREN STUCK WITH A
 LOT OF PEOPLE.
 THERE IS NO POLITICAL
 INCONVENIENCE EXCEPTION TO THE
 UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
 IF ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING IN THIS
 COUNTRY HAD DONE WHAT'S
 DOCUMENTED IN THE MUELLER REPORT
 THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED AND PUT
 IN JAIL.
 IF THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE
 OR THE SENATE WHO WANT TO SAY
 THAT'S WHAT A PRESIDENT CAN DO
 WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS BEING
 INVESTIGATED FOR HIS OWN
 WRONGDOINGS OR WHEN A FOREIGN
 GOVERNMENT ATTACKS OUR COUNTRY
 THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE
 THAT VOTE AND LIVE WITH IT FOR
 THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
 THAT LAST PART, WE ARE GOING
 TO BE HEARING MORE OF THAT.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 YOU SEE THE CROWD THERE
 REACTING, CHEERING HER ON,
 ELIZABETH WARREN IS PROBABLY THE
 LEADER OF THE IDEAS PRIMARY, SHE
 HASN'T CAUGHT ON JUST YET IN
 TERMS OF POLLS AND FUND RAISING
 BUT THERE WITH THAT ANSWER SHE
 IS GOING TO BE ECHOED BY A LOT
 OF PROGRESSIVES.
 WE SEE IN THE HOUSE ALREADY
 SAYING THEY WANT IMPEACHMENT.
 CERTAINLY GRASS ROOTS VOTERS AS
 WELL WHO WANT TO SEE
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I THOUGHT SHE ARTICULATED IT
 QUITE WELL, QUITE CLEARLY IN THE
 WAY SHE HAS DONE WITH OTHER
 POLICY ISSUES, BREAKING UP THE
 BIG TECH COMPANIES, BOLD POLICY
 SHE HAS, FOR INSTANCE, ON
 COLLEGE LOAN DEBT.
 SO WE'LL SEE.
 I MEAN, I THINK SHE SET A REAL
 LINE IN THE SAND AND SHE DID
 THIS EARLIER, SHE'S BEEN THE ONE
 WHO CAME OUT REALLY EARLY AND
 SAID IMPEACHMENT AFTER SHE READ
 THE MUELLER REPORT AND YOU SEE
 THERE WHERE KLOBUCHAR WAS, SHE'S
 LIKE, IT'S NOT UP TO ME.
 SHE SAID I'M ON THE JURY.
 YEAH, IT'S UP TO THE HOUSE,
 EXACTLY.
 AND YOU SAW KAMALA HARRIS
 COMING OUT FURTHER THAN SHE'D
 COME OUT BEFORE IN TERMS OF
 IMPEACHMENT, BUT ALSO SAYING
 LET'S BE PRACTICAL ABOUT THIS,
 IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THE
 SENATE.
 AND IT CAME A BIT FROM BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 I WANTED TO PLAY WHAT THEY BOTH
 HAD TO SAY AND PICK UP ON THAT.
 DO YOU BELIEVE ANYTHING
 YOU'VE READ AND PROCESSED IN
 THAT REPORT COULD HAVE THE WORD
 IMPEACHABLE ATTACHED TO IT?
 ANY -- FIRST OF ALL, I
 BELIEVE I'M THE JURY HERE, I'M
 NOT GOING TO PREDISPOSE THINGS.
 I'M NOT SAYING IT IS OR IT
 ISN'T.
 THERE'S VERY DISTURBING THINGS
 THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE
 THERE'S OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 HERE IS MY CONCERN, AT THE
 END OF THE DAY WHAT IS MOST
 IMPORTANT TO ME IS TO SEE THAT
 DONALD TRUMP IS NOT REELECTED
 PRESIDENT.
 I INTEND TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN
 TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T
 HAPPEN.
 BUT IF -- AND THIS IS AN IF.
 IF FOR THE NEXT YEAR, YEAR AND A
 HALF GOING RIGHT INTO THE HEART
 OF THE ELECTION ALL THAT THE
 CONGRESS IS TALKING ABOUT IS
 IMPEACHING TRUMP, AND TRUMP,
 TRUMP, TRUMP, AND MUELLER,
 MUELLER, MUELLER, WHAT I WORRY
 ABOUT IS THAT WORKS TO TRUMP'S
 ADVANTAGE.
 YOU KNOW --
 GOT A POINT.
 NO, AND IT WAS QUITE THE
 CONTRAST.
 FIRST OF ALL, ELIZABETH WARREN
 HAS -- I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE
 BELIEVES WHAT SHE SAID.
 SHE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE
 MAY BE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE TO
 IT.
 SHE'S HAD A HARD TIME GETTING
 HER CAMPAIGN GOING HERE.
 SHE'S BEEN LEADING ON IDEAS, NOT
 LEADING IN TERMS OF MONEY, NOT
 LEADING IN TERMS OF POLLS AND
 THIS CLEARLY IS SOMETHING SHE
 HOPES WILL IGNITE PEOPLE ON THE
 LEFT.
 SHE'S IN A BIT OF A COMPETITION
 WITH BERNIE SANDERS FOR SOME OF
 THOSE VOTES.
 IN HIS ANSWER WHAT YOU SAW IS
 PART OF THE KEY TO HIS APPEAL
 WHICH IS HIS LASER LIKE FOCUS ON
 ECONOMIC ISSUES AND ECONOMIC
 POPULISM.
 SHE TOO, A POPULIST, BUT HE HAS
 REALLY CORNERED THAT AND HE'S
 BASICALLY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
 THESE ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT ARE
 CLOSE TO PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT'S
 WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, THAT'S
 NUMBER ONE ON MY AGENDA.
 SO DIFFERENT APPROACHES.
 INTERESTING, TOO, WHEN WE
 HEAR FROM KAMALA HARRIS.
 AND I WANT TO PLAY HER RESPONSE
 TO THAT QUESTION.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD
 TAKE THE STEPS TOWARDS
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I'VE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE SINCE
 I'VE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES
 SENATE THAT THE UNITED STATES
 SENATE AND THE REPUBLICANS HOLD
 THE MAJORITY, I'VE NOT SEEN ANY
 EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY
 WILL WEIGH ON THE FACTS INSTEAD
 OF ON PARTISAN ADHERENCE TO
 BEING PROTECTIVE OF THIS
 PRESIDENT AND THAT'S WHAT
 CONCERNS ME AND WHAT WILL BE THE
 EVENTUAL OUTCOME.
 WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT
 WHAT MIGHT BE THE END RESULT BUT
 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE PROCESS
 SHOULD NOT TAKE HOLD.
 THE PROCESS SHOULD TAKE HOLD,
 DAVID CHALIAN, CONGRESS SHOULD
 TAKE THE STEPS, IS THERE A
 SLIGHT SHIFT THERE?
 OH, DEFINITELY.
 I MEAN, JUST OVER THE WEEKEND
 SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS AND DID
 NOT GO TO THIS PLACE OF SAYING
 THAT THE HOUSE SHOULD TAKE
 STEPS.
 IEEE■■■■■■E■EEEEE■■■■■ DAVID AX
 HIT O SOMETHING THERE WHICH IS
 KAMALA HARRIS IS SHOWING US SHE
 TOO DETERMINES IT'S PROBABLY
 SMARTER POLITICS T IN
 TERMS OF ENLIVENING THE
 PROGRESSIVE OF THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO MOVE IN THIS
 POSITION OF SAYING,Y, THE
 HOUSE SHOULD START THIS.
 AND WITHOUT, BY THE##))#■#■■#■■
 POLITICAL DOWNSIDE FOR THESE
 FOLKS TO TAKE THATOSITION.RE OU
 THAT WAY.O HEARD BUTTIGIEG MOVEL
 THIS UP TOUSE AND THE TE BUT HEE
 AFTER REVIEWING T MUEPORT TO SA
 DO SOMETHING.
 THAT SEEMS TO ME A POLITICAL
 PLAY THAT THESE DEMOCRATSAVE
 DETERMINED IS A WAY TO ENLIVEN
 THE BASE WITHOUT REALLY MUCH
 RISK OF ANYTHING -- ANY DOWNSIDE
 FOR THEIR CAMPAIGN AND QUITE
 FRANKLY AS KAMALA HARRIS IS
 SAYING WITHOUT THE NOTION THAT
 DONALD TRUMP IS REALLY IN DANGER
 OF BEING PUSHED OUT OF OFFICE IN
 SOME WAY.
 TO YOUR POINT, THOUGH, ON THE
 LANGUAGE THAT SENATOR HARRIS
 USED IS REAL INTERESTING.
 SHE IS A VERY ACCOMPLISHED
 LAWYER AND SHE GIVES A LOT OF
 LAWYERLY ANSWERS.
 AND THAT WAS LAWYERLY LANGUAGE.
 NOT HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED, WE
 SHOULD TAKE THE STEPS TOWARDS
 IMPEACHMENT WITH A DISCLAIMER
 THAT THE SENATE PROBABLY
 WOULDN'T ACT ON IT AND THERE
 WERE AT LEAST FOUR OTHER
 OCCASIONS DURING HER ANSWERS
 WHEN SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT TOUGH
 QUESTIONS, REPARATIONS, VOTING
 ON THE PART OF PRISONERS WHERE
 HER ANSWER WAS, WELL, WE SHOULD
 HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.
 THAT'S A DISCUSSION WE SHOULD
 HAVE.
 AND I THINK THAT AT SOME POINT
 THIS COULD END UP BEING A
 PROBLEM.
 SHE IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPELLING
 PERSONALITY, VERY BRIGHT AND
 ACCOMPLISHED PERSON BUT SHE'S
 VERY CAUTIOUS AND THAT CAUTION
 WAS PRETTY APPARENT IN A LOT OF
 HER ANSWERS TONIGHT.
 IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU
 LOOK THE JUXTAPOSITION WITH HER
 ANSWERS ON VOTING RIGHTS FOR
 CONVICTED COMMONS BEHIND BARS
 VERSUS WHAT WE HEARD FROM PETE
 BUTTIGIEG, ALL OF THAT CAME
 AFTER THE FIRST PERSON TO REALLY
 TALK ABOUT THIS AND THIS WAS A
 MOMENT THAT NO ONE SAW COMING,
 BUT IT'S CERTAINLY HAVING A
 MOMENT TONIGHT.
 LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT BERNIE
 SANDERS HAD TO SAY ON THAT
 QUESTION.
 I THINK THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS
 INHERENT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
 YES, EVEN FOR TERRIBLE PEOPLE
 BECAUSE ONCE YOU START CHIPPING
 AWAY AND YOU SAY THAT GUY
 COMMITTED A TERRIBLE CRIME, NOT
 GOING TO LET HIM VOTE, OH, THAT
 PERSON DID THAT, NOT GOING TO
 LET THAT PERSON VOTE, YOU'RE
 RUNNING DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
 MY FOLLOW-UP QUESTION GOES TO
 THIS, YOU'RE WRITING AN
 OPPOSITION ED AGAINST YOU LIKE
 YOU'RE SAYING THE BOSTON
 MARATHON BOMBER SHOULD VOTE, NOT
 AFTER HE PAYS HIS DEBT IN
 SOCIETY, BUT WHILE HE'S IN JAIL.
 YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
 CHRIS, I'VE WRITTEN MANY 30
 SECOND OPPOSITION ADS THROUGHOUT
 HI LIFE.
 THIS WILL BE JUST ANOTHER ONE.
 THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT
 WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS
 OPPOSITION AD GOAL, THIS WOULD
 PERHAPS WORK VERY WELL AND IT
 IS.
 BUT --
 LET'S STIPULATE.
 BUT THE RESPONSE IS, WHEN
 PETE BAA UTTIGIEG, HE WAS ASKED
 ANDERSON, I DON'T THINK TO THINK
 ABOUT IT, I'M CLEAR, AFTER
 THEY'VE DONE IT, THEY'VE SERVED
 THEIR TIME, MY ANSWER IS YES.
 I THINK SENATOR SANDERS IS ON
 THE WRONG POLITICAL END OF THAT
 ISSUE.
 PART OF HIS APPEAL, HOWEVER, IS
 THAT HE JUST APPEARS TO BE A GUY
 WHO'S SPEAKING HIS MIND, HE'S
 NOT MAKING CALCULATIONS.
 AND THAT'S PART OF IT.
 PART OF BUTTIGIEG'S APPEAL, AND
 CERTAINLY THAT WAS APPARENT IN
 THAT ANSWER WAS HE ANSWERED
 DIRECTLY.
 THERE'S AN ANSWER THAT'S YES OR
 NO.
 AND HE SAID NO AND HE EXPLAINED
 THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN PRISON
 YOU'RE THERE AND IT'S A
 PUNISHMENT AND YOU MAKE
 SACRIFICES.
 YOU'RE SACRIFICING YOUR FREEDOM
 AND THIS IS ONE OF THE
 SACRIFICES YOU HAVE TO MAKE.
 I SUSPECT HE'D WIN THAT DEBATE
 BUT BOTH OF THEM PROBABLY GOT
 CREDIT FOR NOT EQUIVOCATING
 ABOUT THE QUESTION.
 AND THE RNC WAS OUT PRETTY
 IMMEDIATELY AFTER KAMALA
 HARRIS'S EQUIVOCATION WITH AN
 EMAIL, THE SUBJECT IS KAMALA
 WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
 ABOUT THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER
 VOTING.
 RIGHT?
 SO IT IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE
 MAYBE FOR HER, OR JUST AN
 EQUIVOCATION, ESSENTIALLY SAYING
 OH THIS IS SOMETHING I NEED TO
 THINK ABOUT.
 SHE MIGHT SOLACE IN THE
 FACT THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS WORTHY
 OF THAT.
 YEAH.
 YOU KNOW, MARIO CUOMO, THE
 LATE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK USED
 TO SAY THE ONLY PLACE THEY SHOOT
 BACKWARDS IS IN COWBOY MOVIES,
 MEANING IF YOU'RE AHEAD, THEY'RE
 SHOOTING AT YOU, IF YOU'RE NOT,
 NOBODY IS GOING AFTER YOU.
 SHE'S A TARGET, THAT'S GOOD.
 SHE CAN TAKE SATISFACTION IN
 KNOWING THAT SHE'S ON THEIR
 RADAR SCREEN.
 THAT'S A LOVELY PLACE TO STOP
 OUR CONVERSATION BRIEFLY.
 WE'LL PICK IT UP.
 STAY WITH ME EVERYONE, THESE
 FIVE DEMOCRATS TAKING QUESTIONS
 TONIGHT FROM COLLEGE AGED
 STUDENTS IN A SERIES OFPRESIDEN.
 OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES.
 JUST AHEAD.



       <i> Allergies with sinus</i>     <i> congestion and pressure?</i>
   <i> You won't find relief here.</i>
    <i> Go to the pharmacy counter</i>     <i> for powerful Claritin-D.</i>
 <i>While the leading allergy spray</i>    <i> only relieves 6 symptoms,</i>
 <i>Claritin-D relieves 8, including</i>  <i> sinus congestion and pressure.</i>
    <i> Claritin-D relieves more.</i>

   Carbon Capture is important          technology -

 That's why we're working on ways          to improve it.
           So plants...
     can be a little more...
           like plants.

       Who's idea was this?


 ONE WAY TO STAND OUT OF VOTERS IS ACTUALLY PRE PRETTY
 SIMPLE, GIVE SPECIFICS.
 THE AUDIENCE QUESTIONS TONIGHT
 ASKING FOR THEM, HITTING ON
 SEVERAL ISSUES FROM HEALTH CARE
 TO VETERANS, CLIMATE CHANGE TO
 STUDENT DEBT AND VOTING RIGHTS.
 BACK WITH DAVID CHALIAN,
 NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON AND DAVID
 AXELROD.
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STOOD OUT
 WITH MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG ANDER
 COOPER PUSHED HIM ON THE LACK OF
 SPECIFICS HE'S LAID OUT ON HIS
 WEBSITE.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
 WE NOT DROWN PEOPLE WITH MINUTIA
 BEFORE WE'VE VINDICATED THE
 VALUES THAT ANIMATE OUR
 POLICIES.
 AS DEMOCRATS THIS IS -- WE
 EXPECT PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
 OUR VALUES MUST BE FROM THAT.
 I EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE VERY
 EASY AND CLEAR TO TELL WHERE I
 STAND ON EVERY SPECIFIC POLICY
 CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME, BUT I'M
 GOING TO TAKE THE TIME TO LAY
 THAT OUT WHILE ALSO TALKING
 ABOUT VALUES AND EVERYDAY
 IMPACTS.
 HE'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE
 TIME.
 HE'S GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
 HE'LL GET BACK.
 IS THAT -- I MEAN, IS THAT THE
 RIGHT ANSWER TONIGHT?
 YOU KNOW, IT'S THE ONLY
 ANSWER HE HAS.
 AT THIS POINT.
 I GUESS AT SOME POINT HE WAS
 SAYING WELL THERE'S GOING TO BE
 SOMETHING ON THE WEBSITE WHERE
 YOU CAN DO A SEARCH TO SEE HOW I
 FEEL ABOUT SOMETHING.
 THEN IT WAS THERE.
 WE CONFIRMED IT HAD BEEN ADDED.
 THIS IS A PROBLEM BETO
 O'ROURKE HAS HAD, WHERE IS THE
 BEEF TO YOUR SOARING RHETORIC?
 IN MANY WAYS BETO O'ROURKE IS
 BETTER AT THE SOARING RHETORIC,
 THE VALUES, AND EXPLAINING THE
 VALUES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 THAN PETE BUTTIGIEG IS.
 PETE BUTTIGIEG IS A TECH NOCRAT,
 THERE WASN'T A LOT OF CONNECTION
 EHE MADE WITH THE AUDIENCE
 THERE, BETTER AT THE END.
 IT WAS A BUNCH OF HARVARD KIDS,
 AND HE WENT TO HARVARD.
 SO, AGAIN, THIS -- HE WAS OUR --
 IT WAS OUR FIVE.
 SO MAYBE THE KIDS WERE A LITTLE
 TIRED FROM SITTING THERE.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT TO WORK
 ON THAT.
 PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE'S A
 YOUNG GUY SO HE'S GOT TO COME
 OUT, I THINK, WITH SOME POLICY
 PRETTY QUICKLY.
 HE'S BEEN ON A ROCKET RIDE
 SINCE HIS FIRST CNN TOWN HALL
 WHICH WAS REALLY HIS
 INTRODUCTION TO THE COUNTRY AND
 HE'S BEEN ON A VERY, VERY ENNER
 H
  -- ENGER JETTIC MEDIA BLITZ.
 HE'S AT THAT POINT NOW.
 HE HAS TO BEGIN TO LAY OUT SOME
 OF THE PARTICULARS.
 NOW, WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT
 MOST AMERICANS ARE NOT TUNED
 INTO THIS RACE TO THAT DEGREE.
 HE HAS TIME, JUST AS BETO
 O'ROURKE HAS TIME, WE TEND TO
 JUDGE THESE THINGS IN THE
 MOMENT.
 AND HE'S GOTTEN OFF TO A GREAT
 START.
 BUT THERE ARE LIMITS TO THAT
 BOOSTER ROCKET STAGE AND HE'S
 YOU KNOW, AS YOU'R
 DA DON'T I REMEMBER
 BARACK OBAMA IN 2007?
 CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, DAVID,
 BUT SORT OF SHUNNING THE IDEA
 THAT WHITE PAPERS WERE NEEDED AS
 HE WAS FIRST STARTING OUT HIS
 CAMPAIGN ON EVERY POLICY?
 YEAH, I ALSO REMEMBER, DAVID,
 AND YOU WILL TOO, THAT HE
 STUMBLED, HE WENT TO A TOWN HALL
 IN LAS VEGAS ON HEALTH CARE.
 YEAH.
 AND DID VERY, VERY POORLY AND
 THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
 WERE SAYING, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
 HE'S NOT UP TO THIS.
 MAYBE THE BEEF ISN'T THERE.
 AND OVER THE COMING MONTHS HE
 KIND OF LEVERAGED HIS WAY BACK
 IN, THE DEBATES HELPED HIM DO
 THAT.
 SO WE SHOULD POINT OUT WE'RE AT
 MILE TWO OF A 26-MILE MARATHON.
 RIGHT.
 AND SO PEOPLE WILL FALL
 BEHIND AND CATCH UP, PEOPLE WILL
 GO AHEAD AND FALL BEHIND.
 BUT I DO THINK THAT BUTTIGIEG
 HAS HAD A REMARKABLE RUN HERE.
 BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO --
 HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TURN THE
 PAGE NOW AND GET TO THE NEXT
 ACT.
 LIKE ANY MARATHON NEVER
 DISCOUNT THE LAST POINT TWO,
 THAT'S WHEN WE KNOW.
 AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND WE
 NEED MORE -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
 HOW WE NEED MORE SPECIFICS, YOU
 BROUGHT THIS UP BRIEFLY AT THE
 TOP OF THE HOUR, DAVID, BUT YOU
 TWEETED EARLIER THAT KAMALA
 HARRIS, I BELIEVE YOUR WORDS
 WERE, LIKES TO STUDY STUFF
 BECAUSE WE HEARD THAT FROM HER A
 NUMBER OF TIMES.
 WE PULLED A FEW OF THOSE
 MOMENTS.
 ELIZABETH WARREN IS HERE, AS
 YOU KNOW, SHE SAID THAT SHE
 SUPPORTS STUDENT LOAN
 FORGIVENESS FOR 42 MILLION
 AMERICANS.
 YEAH.
 WOULD YOU GO THAT FAR, DO YOU
 SUPPORT THAT?
 I SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT IS
 ABOUT REDUCING THE DEBT OF
 STUDENT LOANS, THAT'S AN
 IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE.
 DO YOU SUPPORT FINANCIAL
 REPARATIONS.
 I SUPPORT THAT WE STUDY THAT.
 DO YOU THINK AMERICANS HAVE
 THE RIGHT TO VOTE AT AGE 16?
 I'M INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT
 CONVERSATION.
 A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS AND
 STUDYING HAPPENING.
 SHE IS VERY CAUTIOUS AND
 LAWYERLY AT TIMES.
 SHE CAN BE SOARING AND
 CHARISMATIC.
 WHEN SHE GETS A QUESTION SHE'S
 NOT SURE ABOUT SHE TENDS TO GO
 TO THAT REFUGE.
 AND THAT -- YOU KNOW, THE
 THING -- I SAID A LONG TIME AGO
 THAT PRESIDENTIAL RACES ARE MRIs
 FOR THE SOUL.
 LIKE, WHOEVER YOU ARE PEOPLE
 KIND OF SCOPE THAT OUT AND THIS
 WILL BECOME A NOTICED THING.
 YOU HAVE TO COME AND YOU HAVE TO
 BE READY TO ANSWER THESE
 QUESTIONS HONESTLY AND OPENLY.
 AND MAYBE THE ONTO ANSWER IS,
 YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
 ABOUT THAT.
 RIGHT.
 BUT --
 IT WOULD SEEM MORE AND MORE,
 AS PEOPLE BECOME MORE
 TRANSPARENT THEY WANT THAT KIND
 OF ANSWER.
 I THINK THAT SORT OF A
 AUTHENTICITY IS ABSOLUTELY
 ESSENTIAL, ULTIMATELY, IF YOU'RE
 GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A
 PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
 I THOUGHT HER ENERGY AND
 PASSION TONIGHT REALLY SET HER
 APART.
 IN SOME WAYS I THINK A LOT OF
 THE OTHER CANDIDATES, THERE WAS
 A NERVOUSNESS, THERE WAS NOT
 NECESSARILY CONNECTING WITH THE
 AUDIENCE.
 I THOUGHT WHEN SHE CAME OUT SHE
 KIND OF BOUNDED ON STAGE,
 CONNECTED WITH THE AUDIENCE,
 TOLD SOME PERSONAL STORIES,
 TALKED ABOUT HER OWN LIFE AND
 HER OWN RECORD.
 SO I THOUGHT SHE DID HERSELF
 SOME REAL GOOD THERE.
 I THINK I BEGAN TO SEE HER IN A
 DIFFERENT LIGHT.
 ONE OF THE, I THINK, RAPS ON HER
 IS THAT SHE DIDN'T NECESSARILY
 HAVE THE RETAIL POLITICAL SKILLS
 A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS HAVE, SHE'S
 BEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL, A
 DIFFERENT THING THAN IF YOU'RE
 MAYOR OR SENATOR.
 YEAH, I THOUGHT IN THAT WAY
 THERE WAS A WARMTH IN HER
 TONIGHT.
 SHE ALSO MADE A -- SHE MADE
 NEWS TONIGHT BY SAYING SHE WOULD
 ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON
 GUNS.
 SHE DID, YEAH.
 IF CONGRESS DIDN'T ACT WITHIN
 100 DAYS OF HER PRESIDENCY ON
 BACKGROUND CHECKS.
 SO THAT WAS -- THAT WAS CLEARLY
 SOMETHING SHE PLANNED TO DO.
 SHE CAME OUT AND SHE DID IT.
 SPEAKING OF PLANNING, I'M
 GOING TO GUESS THIS WAS PLANNED
 BECAUSE THERE WAS A TOWN HALL.
 I WAS GOING TO SAY, DAVID, IT
 SETS US UP, SENATOR WARREN
 RELEASING HER PROPOSAL TODAY TO
 REALLY CANCEL OUT STUDENT DEBT.
 YOU CAN SEE THE DETAILS THERE ON
 THE SCREEN, BUT CANCELLING UP TO
 $50,000 IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT
 BASED ON INCOME FOR FOLKS MAKING
 $100,000 OR LESS.
 SHE ALSO TALKED VERY
 SPECIFICALLY, THIS IS ALWAYS THE
 QUESTION, OF COURSE, HOW DO YOU
 PAY FOR IT?
 HERE'S HER PLAN.
 I STARTED IN SEVERAL MONTHS
 AGO TALKING ABOUT A WEALTH TAX,
 AN ULTRA MILLIONAIRE'S TAX, IT'S
 TWO CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR OF THE
 GREAT FORTUNES ABOVE $50
 MILLION.
 SO YOUR 50 MILLIONTH AND FIRST
 DOLLAR YOU'VE GOT TO PAY TWO
 CENTS AND TWO CENTS ON ALL OF
 THE DOLLARS AFTER THAT.
 AND HERE'S THE STUNNING PART, IF
 WE ASK THE GREAT FORTUNES IN
 THIS COU AND UNDERSTAND THIS
 ISN'T ABOUT TRYING TO BE NASTY
 OR SAY THAT YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING
 WRONG WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS SAYING,
 LOOK YOU HAD A GREAT IDEA, YOU
 GOT OUT THERE, YOU'VE WORKED
 HARD OR YOU'VE INHERITED WELL,
 WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS.
 DAVID CHALIAN, ONE OF THE
 THINGS THAT REALLY STUCK --
 PARDON ME, STUCK OUT TO ME THERE
 IS HER LANGUAGE.
 IT'S NOT THAT SHE'S PREPARED AND
 SHE'S GOT THIS, WE KNOW SHE
 WANTS TO BE THE POLICY WONK HERE
 IN THIS RACE, SHE'S SAYING TWO
 CENTS, NOT 2%, WE'RE TALKING
 ABOUT PENNIES, THIS IS VERY
 CAREFULLY CHOSEN.
 OH, WITHOUT A DOUBT.
 AND, IN FACT, I THINK IF YOU
 LOOK OVER TIME SHE HAS SHIFTED
 TO THAT.
 WHEN SHE FIRST ROLLED OUT THE
 POLICY OF THE BIG WEALTH TAX
 THAT SHE HAD PUT OUT THERE WAS,
 YOU KNOW, 2% ON IN THE
 OVER 50 MILLION RANGE AND THEN
 3% ON BILLIONAIRES.
 BUT NOW SHE'S INCORPORATING MUCH
 MORE OF THIS NOTION OF PUTTING
 THAT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR PEOPLE
 AND USING, AS YOU SAID, WELL
 CRAFTED LANGUAGE, SAYING WE'RE
 TALKING ABOUT TWO CENTS ON THE
 DOLLAR FOR THE DOLLARS OVER 50
 MILLION.
 SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE A POLICY
 PROPOSAL MANY PEOPLE THINK WOULD
 BE VERY HARD TO GET THROUGH
 CONGRESS AND WOULD BE IN THE
 CURRENT SET-UP, TRYING TO MAKE
 IT MORE RELATABLE AND APPEALING
 FOR PEOPLE AND THAT KIND OF
 LANGUAGE CAN HELP FOR THAT.
 I THINK ELIZABETH WARREN BY
 COMING IN AND ROLLING OUT THAT
 POLICY ON THIS DAY TO THIS CROWD
 OF COLLEGE STUDENTS, THAT WAS NO
 ACCIDENT.
 AND THAT WAS PROBABLY A PRETTY
 SHREWD POLITICAL MOVE FOR HER
 TONIGHT BECAUSE IT'S A HUGELY
 IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THESE FOLKS.
 IT WAS EITHER A SHREWD MOVE
 OR STUNNINGLY GOOD LUCK.
 I'M GOING TO GO WITH SHREWD
 AND WELL PLANNED.
 YOU KNOW WHAT WAS REALLY
 INTERESTING TO ME WAS BACK TO
 BACK ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE
 SANDERS BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY
 IN MANY WAYS THEY'RE GOING AFTER
 THE SAME VOTER.
 THEY HAVE THE SAME OUTLOOK, THE
 SAME SORT OF POPULIST OUTLOOK.
 BUT SHE HAS COME IN WITH THIS
 BATTERY OF VERY SPECIFIC
 PROPOSALS.
 SHE HAS PUT MEAT ON THE COLLEGE
 FOR ALL PROPOSAL THAT SENATOR
 SANDERS DEBUTED FOUR YEARS AGO
 AND SO ON.
 BUT THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT
 STYLES AROUND THE SAME SET OF
 ISSUES.
 HE'S A LOT MORE RHETORICAL.
 SHE'S MUCH MORE PROGRAM ATTIC.
 IT IS FASCINATING TO WATCH.
 STAY WITH US.
 WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO DISCUSS,
 INCLUDING WHO MAY HAVE BEST
 CONNECTED WITH VOTERS TONIGHT.
 WE TOUCHED ON IT A LITTLE BIT.
 WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT.
 WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THEIR
 CHANCES FOR THE NOMINATION?
   Uh-oh, looks like someone's
    still nervous about buying           a new house.
       Is it that obvious?
            Yes it is.
 You know, maybe you'd worry less  if you got GEICO to help with
    your homeowners insurance.
 I didn't know GEICO could helps    with homeowners insurance.
               Yep, they've been doing it for years.
       What are you doing?
            Big Steve?
           Thanks, man.■@■@■@
    <i> Get to know GEICO and see</i>    <i> how much you could save on</i>
          <i> homeowners and</i>        <i> renters insurance.</i>
       <i> There's little rest</i>        <i> for a single dad,</i>
  <i> and back pain made it hard to</i>    <i> sleep and get up on time.</i>
      <i> Then I found Aleve PM.</i>
     <i> The only one to combine</i>        <i> a safe sleep aid,</i>
      <i> plus the 12 hour pain</i>   <i> relieving strength of Aleve.</i>
            <i> I'm back.</i>

 FIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIA CANDIDATES SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO
 VOTERS, TONIGHT IN THE AUDIENCE
 COLLEGE-AGE VOTERS, STUDENTS
 ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS.
 SO WHO WAS ABLE TO BEST
 aaaT■TESSAGE?
 DAVID CHALIAN, NIA-MALIKA
 HENDERSON AND DAVID AXELROD BACK
 WITH US.
 AS WE LISTEN TO DIFFERENT
 MOMENTS, THERE'S BEEN A LOT SAID
 AND A LOT MADE OF WHAT WE'VE
 BEEN HEARING IN RECENT WEEKS
 FROM PETE BUTTIGIEG IN RELATION
 TO MIKE PENCE.
 YOU GOT INTO A PUBLIC BACK
 AND FORTH BETWEEN VICE PRESIDENT
 PENCE AND YOURSELF OVER
 DISCRIMINATIONS OVER LGBTQ
 PEOPLE AND FAITH.
 RICHARD GRE NELL WEIGHED IN ON
 THIS SAYING YOU'VE BEEN "PUSHING
 THIS HATE HOAX ALONG THE LINES
 OF JUSSIE SMOLLETT LONG TIME --
 I KNOW BAIT WHEN I SEE IT AND
 I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT.
 ALL RIGHT, OUR NEXT
 QUESTION --
 HE WASN'T TAKING IT.
 DAVID CHALIAN, HOW DID THAT GO
 OVER THERE IN THE HALL?
 IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
 CROWD PLEASING LINES OF THE
 NIGHT FOR THIS AUDIENCE AND I
 THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT THAT SHOWS
 RIGHT THERE, RIGHT, THAT IS PART
 OF WHY, AS DAVID AXELROD WAS
 DESCRIBING BUTTIGIEG HAS HAD
 THESE ROCKET BOOSTERS ON BECAUSE
 THAT'S RAW POLITICAL SKILL RIGHT
 THERE TO HAVE RICK GRENELL
 TROLLING HIM ANDsTsT■T■T■TUSAL
 GET REENGAGED IN A WAY WITH
 SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT VICE
 PRESIDENT PENCE MAKES LITTLE
 SENSE TO HIM AND HE WAS ABLE TO
 DISPATCH WITH THAT PRETTY
 QUICKLY.
 I WILL SAY, THOUGH, THE LARGER
 BATTLE THAT WE SAWsTsTsTsTsTsT
 HAVING WITH PENCE, YOU KNOW, I
 THINK LY POLITICALLY
 FORENCE AND BUTTIGIEG.
 AND I THINK THEY BOTH REALIZE
 THAT SO THEY SORT OF SEEM TO BE
 OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR BACK
 AND FORTH I THOUGHT A REAL
 UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS
 WORKING FOR EACH OF THEIR
 POLITICAL NEEDS.
 IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
 ANYTIME SOON IS WHAT I'M ALSO
 READING BETWEEN THE LINES THERE
 FROM YOU.
 AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WAY
 PEOPLE WERE CONNECTING, AMY
 KLOBUCHAR WAS UP FIRST, THE
 SENATOR SEEMED A LITTLE NERVOUS,
 I WILL SAY IN THE BEGINNING,
 CLEARLY TRYING TO CONNECT WITH
 HER AUDIENCE, NOT ALL OF THOSE
 MOMENTS SEEMED TO WORK.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 I AM SOMEONE THAT RUNS IN A
 PURPLE STATE.
 IT IS A STATE THAT WHEN I FIRST
 STARTED RUNNING FOR OFFICE THE
 OTHER SENATOR WAS REPUBLICAN,
 THE GOVERNOR WAS REPUBLICAN AND
 THREE OF OUR FOUR CONSTITUTIONAL
 OFFERS WERE REPUBLICAN.
 AND THEN I STARTED RUNNING.
 AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAVE RUN
 I HAVE WON EVERY SINGLE
 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN MY
 STATE, INCLUDING MICHELLE
 BOOKMAN'S, OKAY, THAT'S WHEN YOU
 GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO CHEER.
 SO I --
 THAT IS A GOOD MOMENT, RIGHT,
 FOR HER TO LAY IT OUT LIKE THAT
 AND SAYING I AM THE PERSON WHO
 CAN WIN IN ALL OF THESE PLACES
 BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL
 PEOPLE TO CHEER, DAVID.
 THAT WAS THE JEB BUSH MOMENT,
 REMEMBER THAT, WHEN HE SAID YOU
 CAN CLAP NOW.
 THAT WAS NOT A GOOD MOMENT.
 BUT ON THE WHOLE THAT WAS A
 STRONG ANSWER FOR HER AND SHE
 DID SHOW FLASHES OF HUMOR, ONE
 OF WHICH WAS AT THE EXPENSE OF
 OUR COLLEAGUE CHRIS CUOMO WHEN
 HE WAS TRYING TO GET HER TO
 FINISH AN ANSWER.
 SO THAT WAS TO HER BENEFIT.
 SHE'S A MODERATE AND SHE'S
 SELLING HERSELF AS A MODERATE
 AND SHE'S TALKING TO AN AUDIENCE
 THERE OF YOUNG PEOPLE, THE
 HARVARD POLL SAID THAT 80% OF
 THEM SAID THEY'D RATHER BE WITH
 SOMEONE WHO REFLECTS THEIR
 POINTS OF VIEW THAN SOMEONE WHO
 ARGUES THEY CAN BEAT THE
 PRESIDENT.
 THIS WASN'T NECESSARILY HER
 CROWD, SHE WAS REALLY SPEAKING
 TO THE BROADER AUDIENCE OUT
 THERE.
 HER ARGUMENT IS I'M A MIDWESTERN
 CENTER LEFT POLITICIAN WHO HAS A
 BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING THOSE
 STATES THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
 CARRIED TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY IN

 AND YOU SAW THAT IN HER
 ANSWERS IN THE IMPEACHMENT
 ANSWER BASICALLY SHE'S ON THE
 SENATE SIDE LET THE HOUSE TAKE
 CARE OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER
 OR NOT THEY WANT TO FILE
 ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AND YOU
 SAW THAT IN TERMS OF HER ANSWER
 ABOUT COLLEGE AND SHE SAID AT
 ONE POINT LISTEN I CAN'T STAPLE
 A COLLEGE DIPLOMA ONTO THE
 BOTTOM OF YOUR SEATS, AN
 IMPRACTICAL IDEA THAT YOU CAN
 FORGIVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT, MAKE
 COLLEGE FREE, PUBLIC COLLEGES
 FREE.
 AND THAT'S GOT APPEAL TOO,
 ROOTED IN THE MIDWESTERN, YOU
 KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST --
 HARD WORK AND ALL THAT STUFF.
 IT'S ABOUT LET'S BE HONEST
 WITH WHERE WE STAND RIGHT HERE.
 WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT, WE'RE NOT
 DOING IT.
 HEY, I'D LOVE TO, BUT THERE'S
 SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT.
 IT'S THAT MIDWESTERN
 PRACTICALITY THAT SHE'S RUNNING
 ON.
 THESE HARVARD STUDENTS ARE MORE
 LIKELY WITH FOLKS LIKE BERNIE,
 IF YOU LOOK AT EARLY POLLS OUT
 OF THE HARVARD INSTITUTE OF THE
 IOP A LOT OF THEM ARE WITH
 BERNIE AT THIS POINT.
 SHE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE
 OUT OF THAT MOMENT IF SHE HAD
 BEEN EVEN MORE DIRECT RIGHT FROM
 THE START OF THAT ANSWER ABOUT
 ELIZABETH WARREN SAYING NO, I
 DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AND THIS
 IS WHY.
 AND SHE SORT OF DANCED AROUND IT
 A LITTLE BIT AND SHE TRIED TO BE
 THE TRUTH TELLER.
 TRIED TO PUT THE PILL IN THE
 APPLESAUCE SORT OF.
 AND THAT'S NOT -- YOU EITHER
 HAVE TO BE THE TRUTH TELLER OR
 NOT.
 LISTENING TO ALL OF THIS, I
 FOUND IT INTERESTING SENATOR
 WARREN WAS ASKED WHAT SHE
 LEARNED FROM HILLARY CLINTON IN

 AND CONCERNS ABOUT SEXISM AND
 HER ANSWER ACTUALLY WENT BACK A
 LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND MAY HAVE
 SURPRISED A FAIR AMOUNT OF
 PEOPLE.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 SO EVERY DAY WHEN I SAW A
 LITTLE GIRL I WOULD COME UP AND
 I'D USUALLY GET DOWN, I'M A
 TEACHER, AND I WOULD SAY HI, MY
 NAME IS ELIZABETH.
 AND I'M RUNNING FOR SENATE.
 BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GIRLS DO.
 AND THEN WE WOULD PINKY SWEAR TO
 REMEMBER.
 AND SO EVERY NIGHT WHEN I WENT
 HOME NO MATTER WHAT THE DAY HAD
 BEEN LIKE I WOULD COUNT UP HOW
 MANY PINKY SWEARS WE'D DONE
 DURING THE DAY.
 DAVID CHALIAN,THATaakkk
 PLAYING?
 YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WAS A
 QUITE FRANKLY I THINK ELIZABETH
 WARREN HAD A R STR

  AS A STORY TELLER AND PERFORMER I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK
 AT THE FIELD ACROSS THE
  THEM CAMPAIGNING ON  TRAIL RIGF
 THE MOST CONSISTENT PERFORMERS
 ON THAT SCORE.
 I WILL TELL YOU HER CAMPAIGN
 THOUGHT SO MUCH OF THAT MOMENT
 THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY CLIPPED
 AND SENT OUT TO THEIR
 SUPPORTERS.
 THEY'RE HOPING THAT BRINGS IN
 SOME DOLLARS, BRINGS IN SOME
 EMAIL ADDRESSES AND ORGANIZING
 EFFORT BECAUSE WHAT YOU DIDN'T
 SEE ELIZABETH WARREN DO THERE,
 WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING
 IN HOW SHE ANSWET
 QUESTION, ERICA, WAS SHE DID NOT
 TOUCH THE HILLARY CLINTON
 OF THAT AT ALL.
 THE QUESTION WAS, ARE YOU GOING
 TO BE HILLARIED?
 AND SHE JUST WENT INTO AN
 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION,
 DID NOT SEEM TO WANT TO SORT OF
 ASSOCIATE HERSELF WITH HILLARY
 CLINTON OR IN ANY WAY RELITIGATE
 2016 BUT INSTEAD WANTED TO TELL
 WHAT SHE THINKS IS AN
 INSPIRATIONAL STORY FROM HER
 LIFE ON THE TRAIL AND IT'S ONE
 HER CAMPAIGN CLEARLY THINKS CAN
 GIVE THEM A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE.
 AN ASIDE ON THIS, BUT SHE
 TALKED ABOUT BEING A TEACHER,
 YOU KNOW I WAS A TEACHER AND SHE
 TALKED EARLIER ABOUT HAVING
 STUDIED TO BECOME A SPECIAL
 NEEDS TEACHER WHICH SHE DID
 BRIEFLY IN HER LIFE AND ALL
 THROUGHOUT SHE WAS REFERRING TO
 HERSELF AS A TEACHER BUT SHE
 NEVER MENTIONED THE LAST 30
 YEARS OR SO SHE'S SPENT TEACHING
 AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY IN A ROOM
 FULL OF HARVARD STUDENTS.
 THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT AS
 WELL.
 THAT, I DON'T THINK THEY FEEL IS
 A CREDENTIAL THEY WANT TO
 BURNISH OUT THERE.
 SHE'S TRYING TO BE A TRIBUNE OF
 EVERYDAY PEOPLE AND THAT'S A
 KIND OF SEPARATION THAT SHE
 DOESN'T WANT TO ACCENTUATE.
 IT'S A MARKER OF ELITISM.
 SHE WAS AT HARVARD -- EVEN
 THOUGH SHE WAS THERE IN FRONT OF
 A LOT OF HARVARD KIDS IT WASN'T
 A CARD SHE WANTED TO PLAY
 BECAUSE, AGAIN, SHE LIKES TO
 TALK ABOUT HER HARD SCRABBLE
 ROOTS IN OKLAHOMA.
 ALL LEGITIMATE.
 IT'S ALL LEGITIMATE AND SHE
 TELLS IT VERY EFFECTIVELY.
 YOU'VE SEEN HER OUT ON THE
 STUMP, PEOPLE REALLY CONNECT
 WITH THE STORIES SHE TELLS ABOUT
 GROWING UP AND DROPPING OUT OF
 COLLEGE, AND HER FIRST MARRIAGE
 WENT BAD AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF
 STORIES.
 HER BIOGRAPHY IS FOUNDATIONAL
 FOR HER POLITICS AND THERE'S NO
 QUESTION ABOUT IT.
 DAVID SAYS SHE'S A GREAT STORY
 TELLER.
 MY QUESTION IS, IS SHE TOO GOOD
 A STORY TELLER?
 EVERY ANSWER FEELS LIKE A TED
 TALK TO ME, AND IS IT TOO
 POLISHED?
 IS IT TOO PRACTICED?
 DOES IT SEEM TOO MUCH LIKE A
 PERFORMANCE AND NOT AN ANSWER?
 I DON'T KNOW THE QUESTION -- I
 DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S HAD SOME
 PROBLEMS CONNECTING, MAYBE NOT
 IN THE ROOM, BUT CERTAINLY
 BROADLY TO THIS POINT AND I
 WONDER IF THAT'S A BARRIER
 BECAUSE THE POLICY IS THERE, THE
 BIOGRAPHY IS THERE, ALL THE IND
 GREEDIENTS SHOULD BE THERE FOR
 HER TO DO VERY WELL.
 THIS IN SOME WAYS RELATES TO
 THE QUESTION OF GENDER, RIGHT,
 CAN A WOMAN ACTUALLY
 BREAKTHROUGH?
 IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE POLLS,
 AND LET'S BE HONEST IT'S EARLY,
 I MEAN THE FOLKS WHO ARE LEADING
 THE POLLS, BIDEN, BERNIE
 SANDERS, THERE WAS A POLL OUT OF
 NEW HAMPSHIRE MORE RECENTLY, A
 SMALL STAMP SIZE, BUT I THINK
 MAYOR PETE WAS DOING PRETTY WELL
 IN THIS POLL, THERE IS THIS
 CONVERSATION GOING ON AMONG
 DEMOCRATS, AMONG -- DEMOCRATS OF
 ALL STRIPES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
 LATINOS, WHITE VOTERS AS WELL,
 CAN A WOMAN ACTUALLY WIN?
 AFTER THE HEARTBREAK THAT MANY
 DEMOCRATS EXPERIENCED IN 2016
 MAYBE THEY WANT TO GO WITH A
 SAFER CHOICE THIS GO ROUND AND
 THE SAFER CHOICE LOOKS MORE LIKE
 BIDEN AND MORE LIKE SOMEBODY
 LIKE BERNIE SANDERS, A WHITE
 MALE.
 WITH ALL OF THESE DEMOCRATS,
 OF COURSE, VYING FOR THE WHITE
 HOUSE, THEY'RE FACING A CRITICAL
 QUESTION OF WHO CAN ACTUALLY
 BEAT PRESIDENT TRUMP, IS IT A
 WOMAN, IS IT A WHITE MAN?
 WE'LL DISSECT NEXT.

 THE FIVE CANDIDATES YOU HEARD FROM TONIGHT HAVE THE SAME
 GOAL, THEY WANT TO BEAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020.
 BACK AND DAVID CHALIAN,
 NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON AND DAVID
 AXELROD.
 LOOKING AT THE POLLING, BERNIE
 SANDERS IS CONSISTENTLY AT THE
 TOP AND HE WAS ASKED
 SPECIFICALLY TONIGHT WHY IS IT
 HE THINKS THAT YOUNG VOTERS ARE
 REALLY STILL LOOKING TO BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 HERE'S HIS ANSWER.
 YOUR GENERATION, UNLESS WE
 TURN THINGS AROUND, WILL BE THE
 FIRST GENERATION IN THE MODERN
 HISTORY OF AMERICA TO HAVE A
 LOWER STANDARD OF LIVING THAN
 YOUR PARENTS.
 WE HAVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION IN
 WORKER PRODUCTIVITY BUT
 EVERYTHING BEING EQUAL MANY
 PEOPLE IN YOUR GENERATION WILL
 EARN LESS MONEY THAN YOUR
 PARENTS, YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE
 SCHOOL MORE DEEPLY IN DEBT THAN
 YOUR PARENTS, YOU'RE GOING TO
 HAVE A HARDER TIME FINDING
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN YOUR
 PARENTS.
 I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE
 REASONS WHY OUR MESSAGE HAS
 RESONATED WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.
 EARLIER THaLaLIGHT ON HERE N
 DAVID CHALIAN, A LOT OF WHAT WE
 TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT
 POLLING WAS ALSO NAME
 RECOGNITION.
 THE FACT THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS
 WELL-KNOWN AMONG YOUNG VOTERS
 AND THEaL SUPPORT HE HAD IN 201.
 IS THIS ABOUT NAME RECOGNITION
 OR THE FACT THAT THEY BELIEVE HE
 IDENTIFIES WITH THEIR POLICY AND
 HIS VISION?
 DAVID CHALIAN.
 IT'S A OF BOTH/AND KIND OF
 THING.
 IT'S A BIT OF BOTH, ERICA.
 I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH BERNIE
 SANDERS SUPPORT AND SAY HE'S
 ONLY RIDING HIGH IN THE POLLS
 BECAUSE OF NAME RECOGNITION.
 HE FORMED A REAL BASE OF SUPPORT
 AND THERE IS A BIG CHUNK OF THAT
 SUPPORT THAT IS SHOWING BACK UP
 FOR HIM AGAIN THIS CYCLE, GOING
 TO WHAT DAVID AXELROD WAS SAYING
 ABOUT -- HE SEEMS TO HAVE A HOLD
 ON THEM WHICH IS MAKING IT, I
 THINK, DIFFICULT FOR HER TO GET
 A FOOTHOLD AND MAKE REAL
 TRACTION.
 SO IT IS PARTIALLY THAT HE IS
 CERTAINLY, OF ALL THE PEOPLE ON
 THE STAGE, ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN
 IF NOT THE BEST KNOWN.
 BUT ALSO, AS YOU NOTED, THIS WAS
 PART OF HIS CO LALITION, THE YOH
 N 2016 AGAINST HILLARY
 CLINTON, HE WON THOSE
 MILLENNIALS AND HE HAS BEEN ABLE
 TO KEEP THAT CONVERSATION GOING
 WITH THEM OVER THE COURSEkk OF E
 LAST FOUR YEARS, AND MANY OF
 THEM ARE STILL FINDING HIM AN
 APPEALING CHOICE AT THIS STAGE
 OF THE GAME.
 IT'S KIND OF PARADOXICAL.
 HE'S 79 YEARS OLD AND HE IS
 FAVORED BY SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE.
 AND PART OF IT IS THAT HE SPEAKS
 IN -- HE IS NOT AN
 INCREMENTALIST.
 FOR THOSE IMPATIENT FOR
 SOLUTIONS HE DOES NOT SPEAK IN
 INCREMENTAL SOLUTIONS.
 HE TALKS ABOUT BIG BOLD
 STRUCTURAL REFORMS.
 BUT I'LL SAY, YOU KNOW, LAST
 TIME HE HAD THE FIELD TO HIMSELF
 IT WAS -- IT WAS BERNIE SANDERS
 VERSUS HILLARY CLINTON.
 NOW NOT JUST ELIZABETH WARREN
 BUT COMPETING FOR THESE YOUNGER
 VOTERS YOU HAVE KAMALA HARRIS,
 YOU HAVE PETE BUTTIGIEG, YOU
 HAVE BETO O'ROURKE.
 HE'S
 IF I WERE HIM THAT THIS WAS THIS
 IS HIS SOLID AND BASE.
 SOMETHING ELSE THAT STOOD
 OUT.
 KAMALA HARRIS ASKED ABOUT HER
 COMMENT ABOUT WINNING BACK
 MIDWEST VOTERS.
 THE CONVERSATION THAT ALL OF
 US HAVE BEEN HEARING.
 ESPECIALLY THE 2020 ELECTION.
 WHICH IS A CONVERSATION SAYING
 WHO CAN TALK TO THE PERSON IN
 THE MIDWEST.
 I JUST REJECT THAT NOTION.
 THAT YOU HAVE ONE CONVERSATION
 WITH SOMEONE IN THE MIDWEST AND
 ANOTHER CONVERSATION WITH
 SOMEBODY IN THE SOUTH AND
 ANOTHER CONVERSATION ON THE
 COAST.
 I REJECT THAT NOTION.
 IT IS SHORT SIDED, AND IT IS
 ACTUALLY NOT CONNECTED WITH
 WHERE PEOPLE REALLY ARE.
 THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DON'T WANT
 THAT.
 THEY DON'T WANT THAT.
 THIS IS A VERSION OF OBAMA'S
 LINE ABOUT THERE'S NO RED
 AMERICA OR BLUE AMERICA.
 THERE'S THE UNITED STATES OF
 AMERICA.
 WHICH GOT HUGE APPLAUSE WHEN HE
 DELIVERED THIS LINE.
 IN 2004.
 CLEARLY WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
 WITHOUT REALLY SAYING IT, THE
 IDEA IS CAN SHE APPEAL TO VOTERS
 IN THE MIDWEST WHO ARE WHITE.
 RIGHT?
 CAN A BLACK WOMAN WHO IS FROM
 CALIFORNIA WHO HAS A CERTAIN
 RECORD OF PROGRESSIVE RECORD OUT
 THERE CAN SHE APPEAL TO THE
 WORKING CLASS WHITE GUY WHO
 WORKS IN A FACTORY.
 OR A WAITRESS.
 OR WHITE WOMAN WRATSZ OR
 SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
 OR APPEAL TO BLACK VOTERS IN THE
 SOUTH.
 WE DON'T KNOW.
 THAT'S THE CONVERSATION THAT
 EVERYBODY IS HAVING.
 DOES IT TAKE A WHITE MAN TO
 APPEAL TO THOSE VOTERS OR CAN
 SHE DO IT THE WAY OBAMA DID.
 HE PUT TOGETHER A BROAD
 COALITION.
 HE WAS FROM ILLINOIS.
 THE STATE NEXT TO IOWA.
 WHICH MADE IT EASY FOR HIM.
 THE OTHER WAY THERE'S NO DOUBT
 THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN
 THE COUNTRY AND DEMOCRATS WHO
 ARE TIRED OF BEING DIVIDED.
 FEEL THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A
 DEVICIVE FORCE.
 SHE WAS SPEAKING TO THEM.
 IT WOULD BE READ AS A REBUKE FOR
 EXAMPLE THE SENATOR KLOBUCHAR
 WHO MADE A PRONOUNCED EFFORT AT
 THIS TOWN HALL TO SAY I'M THE
 ONE WHO CAN WIN THE MIDWEST
 VOTERS IN A SENSE WHAT SENATOR
 HARRIS IS SAYING THAT'S THE
 WRONG WAY TO GO.
 THIS STOOD OUT TO YOU.
 SO SENATOR WARREN WAS ASKED WHY
 SHE SHIFTED FROM BEING
 REPUBLICAN TO DEMOCRAT.
 SHE TALKED ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE
 WORKING ON BANKRUPTCY AND HERE'S
 HOW SHE LAID IT OUT.
 BY THE END OF THAT FIGHT I
 PULLY UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY
 SINGLE REPUBLICAN STOOD THERE
 FROM THE BANK AND HALF OF THE
 DEMOCRATS DID.
 SO MY PARTY WAS THE PARTY THAT
 HAT LEAST WE GOT HALF OF THEM TO
 STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE.
 THAT WAS A BIG CHANGE FOR ME.
 BANKRUPTCY BILL OF 2005.
 WHICH REALLY ADVANTAGED CREDIT
 CARD COMPANIES AND ONE OF THE
 PROMOENT POENTS OF THAT
 LEGISLATION WAS JOE WIDEN.
 SENATOR IN DELAWARE.
 WHERE THE COMPANIES ARE MANY OF
 THEM ARE HEADQUARTERED.
 I EXPECT THIS WAS A SHOT ACROSS
 THE BOW AT THE VICE PRESIDENT.
 WHO WERE TOLD IS GOING IT ENTER
 THE RACE.
 IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN EXPECT TO
 HEAR FROM SENATOR WARREN AS WE
 MOVE ALONG.
 IT'S FASCINATING TO WATCH
 THAT.
 JUST THE SHEER VOLUME OF WHAT WE
 SAW TONIGHT.
 THE FACT THAT EACH ONE OF THE
 ATESNG BACKOCK.
 WHAT WAS FASCINATING IS WATCH
 EACH ONE PICK UP WHAT HAD COME
 BEFORE.
 NOT JUST IN THE QUESTIONING BUT
 IN THE WAY THEY SEEM TO BEc
 REACTING TO THE ANSWERS THAT
 CAME BAEFORE AND THE AUDIENCE.
 IT WAS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
 OF THIS CYCLE SO FAR.
 AND AGAIN WE ARE IN THE EARLY
 STAGES.
 TO START SIZING THEM UP AGAINST
 EACH OTHER.
 THIS IS WHY THE POINTS THAT
 DAVID WERE MAKING BEFORE ABOUT
 KAMALA HARRIS'S CAUTION AND
 WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A LIABILITY.
 IN A SLOW LOW EVENT THAT MAY NOT
 HAVE BEEN QUITE AS GLARING AS ON
 A NIGHT WHEN THERE ARE SEVERAL
 COMPETITORS WHO WERE ANSWERING
 MUCH MANY DIRECTLY ON SOME
 QUESTIONS.
 YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN ARE STARTING
 TO SEE THIS NEXT PHASE OF THIS
 CAMPAIGN.
 WHERE THESE FOLKS ARE GOING FOB
 SIZED UP AGAINST EACH OTHER.
 HERE IT WAS IN SUCCESSION ON
 THIS SAME STAGE BEFORE THE SAME
 AUDIENCE.
 WE'RE ONLY A FEW WEEKS AWAY FROM
 THE FIRST DEBATE WHERE THEY WILL
 BE ON THE STAGE TOGETHER.
 AND REALLY MIXING IT UP.
 I THINK THIS AFFORDED US A NEW
 OPPORTUNITY AND NEW LENS TO
 WHICH WE CAN START ASSESSING
 CANDIDATES.
 IT WAS GREAT TO WATCH.
 AND ALWAYS FUN TO TALK ABOUT IT
 ALL WITH THE THREE OF YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 THANKS TO YOU AT HOME FOR
 WATCHING.
