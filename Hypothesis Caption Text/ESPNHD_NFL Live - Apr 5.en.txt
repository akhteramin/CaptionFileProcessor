    where my father's family     came from in Columbia.
       They pinpointed the   Columbian and Ecuador region
    and then there's a whole new Andean region.
        That was incredibly         exciting because
          I really didn't            know that.
          We never spoke     about that in my family.
          It just brings         it home how deep
       my roots are and it       connects me to them,
      and to their spirit,      and to their history.

  we could help lower emissions.
   Carbon Capture is important          technology -
        and experts agree.
 That's why we're working on ways          to improve it.
           So plants...
     can be a little more...
           like plants.



              Really?

   Man this is what I feel like    when I wear regular shoes,
    cramped and uncomfortable.
 We can arrange a little upgrade.
  Which is why I wear Skechers...
          Wide Fit shoes.
 They have extra room throughout.
       They're like a luxury         ride for my feet.
 Try Skechers Wide Fit shoes.
            I switched to MiraLAX             for my constipation.

 EARLIER IN THE SHOW WE ASKED YOU TO WEIGH IN ON THIS.
 A NEW ERA FOR THE JETS UNVEILED
 LAST NIGHT.
 FIRST NEW UNIFORMS SINCE 1998.
 IT FEELS LIKE IT'S A LOT OF
 EXCITEMENT.
 IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO HYPE IT,
 THEN WHO IS?
 WE KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
 THERE.
 RIGHT.
 WE'RE GOING HAVE YOU GO FIRST.
 THERE WAS A POLL.
 I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU GUYS
 THINK.
 SO SINCE YOU SPENT A NUMBER OF
 YEARS THERE IN NEW YORK WITH THE
 JETS, I'M WONDERING WHAT
 PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTE WOULD YOU
 GIVE?
 NOT ONLY DO I KNOW THE
 ORGANIZATION, I HAPPEN TO KNOW
 THE HEAD COACH PRETTY WELL.
 ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, MY
 PERCENTAGE WOULD BE 0.
 THE QUESTION IS WHO ARE THE
 CHANCES OF ADAM GASE BEING THERE
 OR WATCHING IT?
 I PROMISE HE WAS WATCHING SAM
 DARNOLD.
 NOT TOO SHABBY.
 WE'LL TRY IT AGAIN.
 LOOK AT THE SMYLY FACE.
 HERE.
 KNOW WHAT?
 YEAH.
 WE DON'T WANT TO HIT IT.
 ■÷■h■■@■GO.
 YEAH.
 I DID IT.
 YEAH.
 OKAY.
 YEAH, WE DO THAT.
 WE TURN IT BACK UP.
 HUH.
 I WOULD PROBABLY DO THE SAME
 THING.
 IT'S NOT SHOO SHABBY.
 THE LAST THING I CARE ABOUT WITH
 THE JETS ARE THEIR UNIFORMS.
 I CARE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY
 CAN PROTECT THEIR QUARTERBACK.
 DEVELOP THEIR QUARTERBACK.
 I'M PRONE HAVING MAN CRUSHES ON
 CERTAIN GUYS.
 HE'S ONE OF THOSE.
 YEAH I'M THE WORST WHEN IT
 COMES TO UNIFORMS.
 I DON'T CARE.
 THEY LOOK A LITTLE BIT
 COLLEGIATE.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I KNOW I WAS UPBEAT.
 YEAH.
 AND I'M BIG ON UNIFORMS BUT I
 KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE I
 DO.
 THEY GO WITH THE THROW BACK.
 THE HEYDAY AND THE JOE NAYMUTH.
 WHEN THE DOLPHINS ROLL OUT
 THEIR THROW BACKS, PEOPLE GO
 CRAZY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I WISH THEY HAD GONE WITH MORE
 OF A THROWBACK.
 IT'S HARD TO GET THAT ON MY
 PHONE, TOO.
 WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY HAIR
 THERE THE FRIDAY STAPLE.
 WE HAVE A ROOKIE TODAY AND IT
 SHOULD BE FUN.
 COUNTING FLAGS.
