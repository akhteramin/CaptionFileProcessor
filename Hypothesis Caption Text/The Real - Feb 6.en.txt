 WELCOME TO "THE REAL"!
 GOOD MORNING BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.
 OKAY, LET'S JUMP RIGHT INTO
 THIS, SOMETHING SUPER EXCITING
 TO ANNOUNCE.
 IN HONOR OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH,
 WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING
 "THE REAL" ON THE ROAD.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THERE IT IS.
 FIRST A STOP, ON THE ROAD TO
 VISIT SOME OF THE NATION'S MOST
 THRIVING VCU AND WE WILL MEET
 WITH STUDENTS, PLAYING GAMES,
 GIVING AWAY SOME SCHMONEY AND
 LEARNING BY HBCUs ARE
 IMPORTANT TO OUR HISTORY AND OUR
 FUTURE.
 WE GOT ONE RIGHT HERE.
 AND TODAY, OUR "REAL" AMBASSADOR
 IS LIVE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AT
 HOWARD UNIVERSITY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT IS SO COOL.
 WHAT'S UP, DONYA.
 YOU GUYS LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
 WHAT'S UP?
 HELLO HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
 HOW'S EVERYONE DOING?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 ALL RIGHT.
 HOWARD, WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS,
 WHO IS READY FOR SOME LIVE GIRL
 CHAT?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU SO MUCH, WE CAN'T WAIT
 TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
 ABOUT OUR GIRL CHAT TOPICS.
 FIRST UP, IT LOOKS LIKE
 22-YEAR-OLD LAURIE HARVEY HAS
 ADOPTED HER STEPDAD'S "THINK
 LIKE A MAN" APPROACH BY PLAYING
 THE FIELD WITH MANY ELIGIBLE
 BACHELORS.
 LORI, AFTER CALLING OFF HER
 ENGAGEMENT WAS RUMORED TO BE HIS
 SEEING WRAPPER FUTURE FOR A
 WHILE BUT THOSE RUMORS AND IN
 ONE CLAP BACKED OUT HER AFTER
 SEEING PICTURES OF HER HANGING
 OUT WITH TREY SONGS.
 HOWEVER, GLORY RECENTLY DELETED
 PICTURES OF HER AND TREY SONGS
 OFF OF INSTAGRAM AND THEN WAS
 SEEN HANGING OUT WITH DIDDY'S
 SON, AUSTIN COMBS.
 SHE'S ALSO BEEN LINKED TO
 BRITISH RACE CAR DRIVER LEWIS
 HAMILTON.
 AND RUMOR HAS IT, MEEK MILL
 TRIED TO HOLLER AT HER BUT SHE
 WASN'T INTERESTED.
 PEOPLE ON TWITTER HAVE FOUND IT
 EXTREMELY REFRESHING THAT LORI
 IS BASICALLY DOING WHAT SO MANY
 MEN DO.
 LIKE USER I AM MARK LANDRY WAS
 SAID, LORI HARVEY, THE FIRST
 BLACK WOMAN TO SUCCESSFULLY PULL
 A YOU, ON YOU.
 [LAUGHS]
 THAT'S HILARIOUS.
 SO LADIES DO YOU RESPECT
 LORI'S DATING HUSTLE?
 FIRST OF ALL, SHE IS NOT THE
 FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO DO THAT.
 BUT GO AHEAD.
 I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IF
 YOU ARE NOT MARRIED, LADIES
 ESPECIALLY, YOU SHOULD BE OUT
 THERE OPENLY DATING TO GET TO
 KNOW YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU LIKE.
 I'M ALL ABOUT THAT.
 AND HERE WE CALL IT OPENLY
 DATING.
 HOWEVER THATMEANS, MULTI-DATING
 DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE
 MULTI-DOING IT.
 AND IF YOU ARE, THAT'S YOUR
 PREROGATIVE.
 BUT IT'S NOT COOL TO JUST ASSUME
 THAT A WOMAN IS DOING IT.
 I ACTUALLY COINED THE PHRASE.
 I WROTE A BOOK CALLED "LOVE THEM
 OR LEAVE THEM BUT DON'T GET
 STUCK WITH THE TAB."
 AND IN IT, I WAS TALKING ABOUT
 HOW WE GET CAUGHT UP WITH ALL
 THESE RULES.
 THERE WAS LIKE THIS 90 DAY RULE,
 AND I THOUGHT, WHO WANTS TO
 SPEND TIME WITH ONE PERSON FOR
 90 DAYS AND I THOUGHT, THAT'S
 NOT REALLY REALISTIC.
 SO I APPLAUD SOMEONE LIKE LORI
 BECAUSE YOU SHOULD MULTI-DATE,
 AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT,
 MULTI-DATING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
 GET TO KNOW SOMEBODY.
 WHEN I FIRST STARTED THIS SHOW,
 I WAS MULTI-DATING AND PEOPLE
 THOUGHT, YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO
 BRING A GUY ON THE SHOW.
 AND THEY SAID TO YOU JUST DON'T
 WANT TO DATE A GUY WHO IS
 MARRIED.
 IN THAT TIME, IF YOU DATE MORE
 THAN ONE GUY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
 ARE YOUNG, YOU FIND OUT WHAT YOU
 LIKE OR DON'T LIKE IN A MAN.
 SO WHAT SHE'S DOING IS ACTUALLY
 THE WAY DATING IS SUPPOSED TO
 BE, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
 IN A MATURE WAY, THE RISK
 MUNICATION INVOLVED.
 I'VE BEEN A VERY OPEN ABOUT
 THAT.
 I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK
 THEY ARE THE ONLY ONE.
 BUT SOME PEOPLE THAT'S NOT FOR
 THEM.
 WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT YOU AND
 GZ, WE ARE LIKE, YOU ARE NOT
 EXCLUSIVE.
 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
 OBVIOUSLY SPOKEN ABOUT BETWEEN
 THESE PEOPLE AND AGAIN I THINK
 IT SO IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH
 THAT WHAT YOU SEE ON
 SOCIAL MEDIA, SOMEBODY TAKING A
 PICTURE WITH SOMEBODY DOES NOT
 MEAN THEY ARE SLEEPING TOGETHER.
 BUT WHAT IT IS IS, MEN ARE
 FEARFUL.
 THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR
 YEARS.
 THEY WANT TO SHAME US AND SAY,
 IF THEY SEE YOU OUT WITH A GUY,
 SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU.
 NOTHING IS WRONG WITH YOU.
 DON'T LET MEN CONTROL YOU.
 THEY ARE DATING, SO WHAT DO
 YOU HAVE FOR US?
 I HAVE SIDNEY HERE.
   HI, LADIES.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
 MULTI-DATING?
 I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH
 LONNIE.
  LONI.
 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
 DATING PEOPLE WHO ARE IN YOUR
 SOCIAL CIRCLE OR OUTSIDE OF YOUR
 SOCIAL CIRCLE.
 THERE IS NOTHING BETTER TO DO
 THAT THEN GOING OUT ON A MILLION
 DATES IF YOU WANT TO, THREE
 DATES IF YOU WANT TO.
 THIS IS JUST WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
 THERE ARE SOME FINE MEN AT
 HOWARD UNIVERSITY.
 I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH
 ONE I WAS GOING TO -- [LAUGHS]
 I'M WONDERING.
 DO YOU THINK GUYS -- ACTUALLY WE
 KNOW THAT GUYS CAN GET INSECURE
 ABOUT THIS, KNOWING THE GIRL
 THEY ARE DATING IS SEEING OTHER
 GUYS, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY
 SHOULD BE.
 I THINK THEY SHOULD RESPECT THE
 FACT THAT SHE IS BEING HONEST
 AND THEN GIVE UP THEM A CHANCE.
 WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG YOU HAVE TO
 FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU LIKE AND
 WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE, AND YOU
 WILL NEVER KNOW THAT IF YOU
 MARRY THE FIRST AND THEN END UP
 YEARS LATER DOWN THE ROAD GOING,
 I WISH I WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED
 SOMETHING ELSE OR SEEN SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
 SAY, DIFFERENT STROKES FOR
 DIFFERENT FOLKS.
 THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO LOVE
 TO MULTI-DATE.
 COOL.
 THEN THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO
 GET EXHAUSTED DOING THAT.
 DID YOU MULTI-DATE?
 NO I DIDN'T, AND I DID TURN
 OUT OKAY.
 SO I WANT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW,
 IT'S OKAY TO DO THAT AS WELL.
 IT'S NOT OKAY TO JUDGE A PERSON
 WHO MULTI-DATES AND IT'S NOT
 OKAY TO JUDGE A PERSON WHO
 CHOOSES NOT TO.
 I ALSO WANT TO SAY, WHEN YOU
 DATE ONE PERSON, YOUR MIND AND
 YOUR ASPIRATIONS ARE LIMITED TO
 WHATEVER THAT PERSON BRINGS INTO
 YOUR LIFE.
 THEY ARE LIKE, WE GO AND DO
 THESE THINGS, WE TALK ABOUT
 THESE THINGS.
 YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU CAN
 GROW AND MATURE TO UNTIL YOU
 OPEN THAT UP TO SOMEBODY WHO MAY
 BE CHALLENGES YOU IN AREAS THAT
 YOU NEED TO.
 THAT'S WHY MULTI-DATING ALLOWS
 YOU TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
 YOURSELF, WHAT YOU NEED VERSUS
 WHAT YOU WANT.
 AND THE SECOND PART I WANT TO
 SAY IS, THE COOL THING ABOUT
 MULTI-DATING IS, ONCE YOU SEE
 AND GET TO KNOW YOUR OPTIONS, IT
 WILL BE REALLY CLEAR WHEN THAT
 ONE PERSON MOVES YOU IN SUCH A
 WAY WHERE YOU THINK, I'M NOT
 INTERESTED IN MULTI-DATING
 ANYMORE BECAUSE YOU ARE WHO I
 WANT TO.
 ANOTHER WOMAN WHO IS DATING A
 HIGH-PROFILE MAN IS JENNIFER
 LOPEZ AND YESTERDAY TWITTER
 MELTED DOWN AFTER A RUMOR
 SURFACED THAT J.LO WOULD BE
 PERFORMING A MOTOWN TRIBUTE AT
 THIS SUNDAY'S GRAMMY AWARDS IN
 HONOR OF THE LABELS 60TH
 ANNIVERSARY.
 AMONG THE NEWS, JAMAIL HILL
 TWEETED "I HAVE QUESTIONS."
 CAN WE JUST CANCEL BLACK HISTORY
 MONTH?
 REBOOT FOR 2020?
 WE ARE IN WEEK ONE AND I CAN'T
 TAKE MUCH MORE.
 THIS IS -- THIS IS THE GRAMMYS
 ASKING J.LO TO DO THIS.
 I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.
 THIS IS A CLEAR RUMOR, AND THE
 THING ABOUT THE GRAMMYS, EVERY
 TIME THEY NEED ATTRIBUTE FOR A
 BLACK PERSON, THEY GO TO
 MADONNA.
 AS MADONNA NOT THIS TIME?
 IT'S LIKE -- I GUESS MAYBE
 MADONNA IS LIKE, LOOK.
 I'M TIRED OF THIS ALL RIGHT?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 FOR ME JUST AS A FAN OF THAT
 MUSIC COME UP WITH ALL THOSE
 GREATS THAT WE JUST LISTED AND
 SO MANY MORE, I LIKE THE OG.
 I'D LIKE TO HEAR ON ENSEMBLE OF
 THE GREATEST.
 I WOULD LOVE THAT, TOO.
 BUT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN IT'S
 ATTRIBUTE IT'S USUALLY OTHER
 ARTISTS DOING IT.
 THEY GET TO SIT IN THE AUDIENCE
 AND BE LIKE, I KILLED THAT ONE.
 DO WE KNOW IF J.LO IS THE ONLY
 PERSON DOING -- THIS WAS ALL
 A RUMOR, AND IT ALL HAPPENED
 YESTERDAY.
 IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR
 ETHNICITY.
 MOTOWN IS A SOUL SONG, IT'S A
 SOUL MUSIC.
 TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM POP OR
 HIP-HOP.
 THE RANGE IS LIKE -- WHAT
 ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
 NO, I'M JUST SAYING IT'S A
 CERTAIN TYPE OF CATEGORY AND
 MUSIC.
 WHEN I THINK OF MOTOWN, I THINK
 OF THAT SOULFUL VOICE THAT HAS
 LIKE EIGHT DIFFERENT RANGES IN
 THE BOYS.
 NOW THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF MOTOW
 MOTOWN.
 IT INFLUENCES SO MANY PEOPLE AN
 AND, IT INFLUENCES JENNIFER
 LOPEZ AND INFLUENCED ME.
 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE
 PERFORMANCE BROUGHT END.
 HAVE A DELL SING A SONG, I HAVE
 JENNIFER HUDSON SANG A SONG.
 "FANTASIA" SING A SONG OR ALICIA
 KEYS.
 I THINK WHOEVER DOES THE BET
 TRIBUTES NEEDS TO PRODUCE THIS
 ONE BECAUSE THEY WILL GET THE
 RIGHT SINGERS.
 THEY WILL GET THE FANTASIAS, THE
 JILL SCOTT'S, -- SO
 REALISTICALLY, I KNOW WE JUST
 SAID THAT THEY ARE ALL ALIVE,
 BUT USUALLY FOR TRIBUTES THEY
 HAVE SOMEONE ELSE PERFORM THE
 SONGS.
 BUT I AGREE, IT WOULD BE
 INCREDIBLE TO SEE THEM COVER
 THEIR OWN SONG SINCE THEY ARE
 STILL HERE.
 I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT.
 NOW YOU SAID IT'S NOT A RACIAL
 THING, YOU SAID, WOULD IT BE
 OKAY IF ADELE SING THE SONG OR
 JUST A DAY?
 IS CONSIDERED AN R&B ARTIST.
 SAM SMITH IS CONSIDERED -- SO WE
 ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE COLOR
 HERE.
 LET'S BE REALISTIC.
 I THINK IT THAT WOULD BE
 AMAZING IN AN ENSEMBLE BECAUSE I
 ACTUALLY THINK SHE COULD DO
 DIANA ROSS VOCALS.
 NO?
 I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
 EVERY TIME IT'S US, YOU ALL ARE
 GOING SOMEPLACE ELSE.
 THAT IS ABOUT ETHNICITY.
 THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN SING,
 AND, I'M PRETTY SURE KNOWING
 J.LO BEING THE SMART BUSINESS
 WOMAN SHE IS SHE WOULD STEER THE
 SHARE THE STAGE.
 SHE COULD DO ONE SONG, AND THAT
 WOULD BE THE WAY TO DO IT.
 BUT TO NOT -- BECAUSE MOTOWN
 HAD SUCH AN IMPACT ON BLACK
 MUSIC AND BLACK HISTORY, AND I
 WANT TO KNOW WHAT
 HOWARD UNIVERSITY THINKS ABOUT
 THIS.
 DONYA?
 I HAVE MARAN.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 I THINK JUST BECAUSE J.LO HAS
 BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY FOR SO
 LONG, SHE WILL KILL IT EITHER
 WAY.
 OKAY.
 WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, AND WE
 HAVE AT ALEXIS G AT ONE OH
 EIGHT, SHE SAID HER PERFORMANCES
 ARE AMAZING.
 THEN WE HAD THE BALL MOM SAID,
 J.LO IS AN AMAZING PERFORMER AN
 AND, AND I GUESS IN THIS CASE
 THAT WOULD BE THE BEST.
 IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE
 GRAMMYS, DO IT RIGHT.
 TUNE INTO "E! NEWS" AND YOU
 WILL SEE ME COVERING THE FASHION
 AND ALL THE FUN ARTISTS.
 AND I WILL LET YOU GUYS KNOW
 WHAT'S GOING TO GO DOWN.
 WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK BUT
 THERE IS SO MUCH MORE LIVE
 "GIRL CHAT."
 STAY RIGHT THERE.
 FROM "A MILLION LITTLE THING
 THINGS."
 PLUS CHICAGO, WHERE ARE YOU?
 AND, CAN YOUR HAIR EVER BE TOO
 MUCH TO BEAR?
 DIY HAIR CARE JUST FOR YOUR HAIR
 TYPE.
 THAT'S ON ALL NEW "THE REAL" ."
 WELCOME BACK TO "THE REAL." WE ARE NOT JUST HAVING LIVE
 "GIRL CHAT" TODAY, WE ARE LIVE
 AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 SAY, WHAT'S UP, HOWARD?
 OKAY.
 THEY DID IT, I COULD HEAR IT
 FROM OVER THERE.
 SENATOR CORY BOOKER RECENTLY
 ANNOUNCED ITS 2020 CAMPAIGN TO
 RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AND HE HAS
 ALREADY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING.
 COREY WAS BEING INTERVIEWED ON
 THE BREAKFAST CLUB WHERE
 CHARLEMAGNE GRILLED HIM NOT JUST
 ON HIS DATING VIEWS BUT HIS
 LIFE.
 HE SAID WELL HE'S NOT DATING
 HER, HE'S "GOT A BOO-BOO.
 NO SINGLE MAN HAS BEEN ELECTED
 PRESIDENT AND HAS BEEN SINGLE
 SINCE 1892.
 DO YOU THINK AMERICA IS READY
 FOR A BACHELOR PRESIDENT.
 THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
 LONI IS SAYING NO.
 YOU COULD HAVE ALL OF THESE
 WOMEN SLIDING UP INTO THE
 WON'T HAVE A FIRST LADY.ND WE-
 WE MIGHT HAVE A WHITE HOUSE
 WEDDING.
 WOULDN'T THAT BE COOL?
 WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?
 A WHITE HOUSE WEDDING.
 STAY SINGLE, INSTEAD OF, I
 DON'T WANT YOUR MARRIAGE TO BE
 PART OF YOUR CAMPAIGN.
 THINK ABOUT DATING.
 YOU HAVE LOTS OF SECRET SERVICE
 AROUND THEM, SO -- IT COULD
 BE LIKE AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF
 MICHAEL DOUGLAS, AND TAKE YOU
 UP.
 I'D RATHER THAT YOUR POLICY
 BE WHAT WE FOCUS ON.
 I DO WHENEVER A PRESIDENT
 STEP SIN, AND THE FIRST LADY IS
 REALLY SOMEONE THAT I LOOK
 FORWARD TO.
 I THINK A WOMAN IS GOING TO HAVE
 A DIFFERENT LENS THAT IS
 NECESSARY ON SOCIETY THEN A MAN.
 SO I WILL BE MISSING OUT ON THAT
 AND I WONDER, IF THERE WAS A
 SINGLE PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD HE
 DO TO SUPPLEMENT THAT?
 OR WHAT WOULD SHE DO?
 I'M SAYING A SINGLE MALE
 PRESIDENT.
 THAT ROLE CAN'T BE OVERLOOKED
 BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY
 TO TAKE CARE OF THAT.
 WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
 HAVE SOMEONE OVERLOOKING --
 IF SHE HAS A SISTER OR AN AUNTIE
 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT --
 YES.
 HOLD ON, NOW I HAVE A REAL DEEP
 QUESTION.
 COULD A GIRL FRIEND OVER?
 SO THEN YOU HAVE AN ANSI, A
 COUSIN AT A HOME GIRL BUT A
 GIRLFRIEND.
 THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT SIDNEY
 WADE DID NOT TAKE OVER AS
 FIRST LADY.
 SHE DIDN'T DO THAT IN THE MOVIE
 SO WE CAN HAVE THAT IN REAL
 LIFE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 SERIOUSLY.
 AND THEY DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER.
 I THINK WE GOT SPOILED WITH
 MICHELLE OBAMA.
 TO BE HONEST.
 SHE REALLY TOOK ACTION AND SPOKE
 OUT AND MADE US ALL FALL IN LOVE
 WITH HER.
 AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
 INTERESTING

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK TO "THE REAL,"
 TIME FOR MORE LIVE "GIRL CHAT."
 WE ARE PAYING TRIBUTE TO OUR
 NATION'S TOP HBCUs ALL MONTH
 LONG AND TODAY, OUR REAL
 AMBASSADOR DONYA IS AT
 HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 RIGHT NOW, DONYA IS ACTUALLY
 LIVE WITH HOWARD'S PRESIDENT,
 DR. WAYNE FREDERICK.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 HI!
 IT'S SO GREAT TO MEET YOU,
 DR. FREDERICK.
 I HEAR YOU ARE A THREE-TIME
 ALUMNUS OF HOWARD.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ATTRACTS
 STUDENTS TO YOUR UNIVERSITY?
 WELL YOU KNOW I THINK SOME OF
 THE SAME THINGS THAT ATTRACTED
 ME HERE.
 THE FIRST BEING ACADEMIC
 EXCELLENCE THAT OCCURS HERE.
 HOWARD EPITOMIZES BLACK
 EXCELLENCE AND I THINK THE
 SECOND THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS
 BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY THAT WE
 HAVE.
 WE HAVE DIVERSITY FROM 44 STATES
 AND 71 COUNTRIES.
 AND THAT THE LAST THING IS, THE
 STUDENT SERVICES.
 THEY ARE SOME OF THE BEST AT
 GOING OUT ON SOLVING THE WORLD'S
 PROBLEMS.
 THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
 AND WHAT MAKES THE HOWARD
 EXPERIENCE SO UNIQUE?
 WELL, THE HOWARD EXPERIENCE
 IS UNIQUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS.
 AS SMART AS ALL STUDENTS ARE,
 THEY ARE ALSO IN THE MIDDLE OF
 POP CULTURE AT ANY GIVEN TIME
 WHEN THEY COME ON THE CAMPUS.
 YOU LOOK AT OUR ALUM AS WELL AND
 THEY GET A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE
 OF WHO THEY SHOULD BE AND WHAT
 THEY SHOULD BE DOING AS THEY GO
 OUT INTO THE WORLD.
 SO YOU HAVE AN ALUMNUS RUNNING
 FOR PRESIDENT BUT ANY NIGHT OF
 THE WEEK YOU COULD TURN ON YOUR
 TELEVISION SET AND THERE IS A
 HOWARD ALUM.
 PEOPLE LIKE FELICIA BECHARD, WE
 HAVE MIRRORS AND STATES PEOPLE
 AND A WIDE VARIETY OF GREAT
 THINGS THAT I THINK CONTINUED TO
 BE EPITOMIZED IN OUR STUDENTS AS
 WELL.
 YOU ARE PULLING UP RECEIPTS,
 I SEE.
 AND YOU GUYS HAVE TO TAKE A
 BREAK, BUT THERE IS MORE OF
 "THE REAL" ON THE WAY RIGHT
 AFTER THIS.
 THIS FRI-YAY, THE PARTY
 DOESN'T STOP.

 WELCOME BACK. OUR GUEST IS A TRIPLE THREAT.
 HE SINGS, HE ASKED AND HE IS THE

 HE'S A SIX TIME AWARD WINNER AND
 A GRAMMY NOMINEE WHO AFTER 30
 YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS IS NOT
 SLOWING DOWN.
 PLEASE WELCOME, WAYNE BRADY.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 MUSICA PHYSICAL
                 I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
 SOME EXCITING THINGS ARE
 HAPPENING.
 FIRST OF ALL, I'D TALK ABOUT YOU
 AND AL PACINO.
 I MET AL AT A SCHOOL PLAY,
 OUR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.
 I HAVE SEEN HIM A FEW TIMES BUT
 I'M NOT ONE TO BOTHER PEOPLE.
 ESPECIALLY AT SCHOOL.
 LIKE, I FEEL THERE ARE CERTAIN
 PLACES THAT SHOULD BE KIND OF
 SACRED, BUT SO MANY PEOPLE GO TO
 THE SAME SCHOOL, AND IT'S LIKE,
 THEY ARE GREAT, HERE'S THE
 SCRIPT.
 SO IF YOU ARE MEANT TO SPEAK
 THEN YOU ARE WILL SPEAK.
 I WAS TRAPPED IN A LINE OF
 CHAIRS AND HE WAS COMING TOWARD
 ME.
 I HAD A LITTLE FREAK OUT MOMENT.
 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE GOES,
 WAYNE?
 AND, HE GIVES ME A HUG, IT'S ONE
 OF THE SWEETEST GUYS AND,
 GROWING UP WATCHING AL, AND
 ESPECIALLY EVERYBODY HAS ON
 AL PACINO IMPRESSION WHICH I
 WOULD NEVER DO FOR HIM TO HIS
 FACE.
 HE MIGHT BE WATCHING THIS, TOO.
 YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A LITTLE
 OWL.
 NO, MINE PROBABLY SUCKS.
 LIKE, SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE
 FRIEND.
 EVERYBODY DOES THAT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 SO YOU ARE RUBBING ELBOWS
 WITH AL PACINO AND YOU ALSO
 RECENTLY SANG WITH JOHN
 BON JOVI?
 I'M NOT BRAGGING ABOUT STUFF.
 TELL US WHAT IT WAS LIKE.
 AND OUR KIDS THE SAME
 SCHOOL -- NO.
 I WAS DOING A CORPORATE GIG, A
 CORPORATION THAT CALLED AND
 BOOKED US FOR THE SHOW.
 IT'S A WEIRD LINEUP, BECAUSE IT
 WAS ME AND A GROUP CALLED THE
 ILLUSIONIST.
 AND THEN WE WERE OPENING UP FOR
 JOHN BON JOVI WHICH IS SUCH A
 COOL, WEIRD LITTLE THING.
 THE COMPANY WAS AMAZING AND TO
 BE ABLE TO SING WITH JOHN, HE
 BROUGHT ME UP ON STAGE.
 THERE IS ON THE OTHER GUY AND, I
 WAS LIVING THE ROCK STAR
 FANTASY.
 SPEAKING OF, YOU'VE TEASED US
 AND SAID YOU ARE WORKING ON NEW
 MUSIC.
 SO, ANY UPDATES?
 YEAH.
 I HAVE A SINGLE THAT MY BUDDY
 JAMIE JONES AND JACK AND ANOTHER
 GUY CALLED THE HEAVY WEIGHT.
 SO SHOUT OUT TO THOSE GUYS.
 THEY HAVE WRITTEN A SONG THAT'S
 CALLED A FLIRTING WITH FOREVER
 AND WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO
 RELEASE IT IN THE NEXT COUPLE
 WEEKS.
 JUST A SINGLE.
 AND IT'S CALLED "FLIRTING
 WITH FOREVER?

 YES.
 NOW SOME OF YOU SAID -- MOST OF
 MY COMEDY IS MUSIC BUT IF YOU
 DON'T KNOW, GO TO iTUNES AND
 CHECK IT OUT, I RELEASED A
 RECORD CALLED "LONG TIME
 COMING."
 IT WAS GREAT, I GOT A GRAMMY
 AWARD NOMINATION.
 BUT FOLKS HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT
 I AM THE MONSTER ON THE MASKED
 SINGER.
 IT'S NOT ME.
 BUT IT'S MY WAY OF SAYING, GO
 LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AND YOU
 COULD SEE IT WASN'T ME SO YOU
 CAN SEE WHEN MY SINGLE COMES OUT
 THAT IT'S NOT ME.
 BUT THE MONSTER IS DOPE.
 I SOUND NOTHING LIKE THAT.
 I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
 WOULD YOU DO THE MASKED
 SINGER?
 IT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE I HAVE --
 THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING, I
 WANT TO BRING TO THE LIGHT, SO I
 DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE --
 I LOVE THE FACT THAT THE SHOW
 GIVES LIGHT TO THOSE STARS THAT
 CAN SING AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD
 THAT SHINED TO BE ABLE TO DO
 THAT.
 BUT I'M LUCKY ENOUGH THAT, EVEN
 ON "LET'S MAKE A DEAL, IT'S A
 MUSICAL VARIETY.
 GOING BACK TO BROADWAY, --
 ARE YOU GOING BACK TO BROADWAY?
 THAT'S MY INTENT.
 I'VE BEEN IN "BOOTS" AND
 "HAMILTON."
 BROADWAY IS MY FIRST LOVE.
 YOU ARE ALWAYS WORKING,
 WAYNE.
 LAST YEAR YOU JOINED THE COST OF
 "THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL" AS
 AN OB-GYN.
 WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO JOIN THE
 SHOW?
 A FEW REASONS.
 REASON ONE, MY GRANDMA.
 WE USE TO WATCH THE BOLD AND THE
 BEAUTIFUL AND THE YOUNG AND THE
 RESTLESS, HER STORIES.
 AND I WAS I DECIDED TO DO THIS
 BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SHE LOVES
 THOSE STORIES.
 AND MY DAUGHTER BOOKED A ROLE ON
 THERE AND SHE IS A RECURRING ON
 THAT SHOW.
 SO I GET A CHANCE TO WORK WITH
 HER.
 AND, I LOVE TO MAKE PEOPLE MAD
 AND MAKE FOLKS TALK.
 EITHER IS DON'T LOOK DOWN OR
 STAY IN YOUR LANE.
 HE'S AMAZING AND SMART, MAKES
 REALLY BOLD CHOICES, AND AND
 FOLKS LIKE TO CONNECT.
 AND, CHECK THIS OUT.
 YOU CAN TELL ME HONESTLY, ARE
 YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE
 SHOW AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I
 COULD DO TO IMPROVE WHAT I'M
 DOING?
 YOU ARE VERY TALENTED AND YOU
 MAKE ME LAUGH VERY MUCH.
 AND I HAVE NO IMPROVEMENTS THAT
 I WOULD GIVE YOU.
 PROFESSIONALLY.
 INCORPORATED YOU VERY MUCH
 MA'AM, I APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT.
 I WILL TALK TO YOU AT THE NEXT
