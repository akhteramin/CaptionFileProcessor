 Woodruff: GOOD EVENING, I'M JUDY WOODRUFF.
 ON THE NEWSHOUR TONIGHT, A HOUSE
 DIVIDED-- PRESIDENT TRUMP
 DELIVERS HIS STATE OF THE UNION
 AFTER THE LONGEST GOVERNMENT
 SHUTDOWN AND NO DEAL IN SIGHT
 FOR A BORDER WALL.
 WE TALK WITH LAWMAKERS,
 HISTORIAN MICHAEL BESCHLOSS PUTS
 THE ADDRESS IN CONTEXT, AND OUR
 PANEL PREVIEWS WHAT IS AT STAKE
 FOR THE PRESIDENT.
 PLUS, MR. TRUMP'S PLAN TO KEEP
 FORCES IN IRAQ TO MONITOR IRAN
 SPARKS CONDEMNATION IN BAGHDAD
 AND CALLS FOR THE U.S. TO LEAVE.
 ALL THAT AND MORE ON TONIGHT'S

 STATION FROM VIEWERS LIKE YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 Woodruff: THIS IS STATE OF THE UNION NIGHT, AND THE BATTLE
 LINES ARE DRAWN.
 THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS PRESIDENT
 TRUMP WILL APPEAL FOR UNITY,
 EVEN AS HE HOLDS TO HIS DEMAND
 FOR A BORDER WALL.
 NEWLY RESURGENT DEMOCRATS SAY
 THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IS THE
 PROBLEM.
 THE SPLIT WAS CLEAR AT THE
 CAPITOL TODAY AS MR. TRUMP'S
 SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS SOUNDED
 OFF.
 I THINK HE'S GOING TO DO A
 GOOD JOB AND I THINK HE REALLY
 IS MAKING AN EFFORT.
 HE'LL MAKE SOME STATEMENTS
 TONIGHT THAT'LL SURPRISE A LOT
 OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
 AND I'M TALKING ABOUT
 CONCILIATORY THINGS.
 AND I THINK IT COMES FROM THE
 HEART.
 THIS GUY IS-- HE HAS BACKGROUND
 THAT HAS SHOWN HIM IN DIFFERENT
 LIGHTS AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
 SUCCESSFUL.
 WELL THE PRESIDENT HASN'T
 BEEN ACTING ON UNITY FOR TWO
 YEARS UP AND DOWN THE LINE.
 HE'S ALWAYS CRITICIZING,
 DIVIDING, AND SO IF HE CALLS FOR
 UNITY TONIGHT WE'LL HAVE TO SAY
 WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW AND THE
 DAY AFTER AND THE DAY AFTER.
 BECAUSE IN PAST HE'S CALLED FOR
 UNITY AND HAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT
 BY THE NEXT MORNING.
 Woodruff: THE FORMAL
 DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE TONIGHT WILL
 COME FROM STACEY ABRAMS.
 SHE NARROWLY LOST HER BID LAST
 YEAR TO BECOME GEORGIA'S FIRST
 BLACK GOVERNOR AND IS NOW A
 RISING STAR IN THE PARTY.
 LET'S TURN NOW TO OUR LISA
 DESJARDINS AT THE CAPITOL AND
 YAMICHE ALCINDOR AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE.
 YAMICHE, TO YOU FIRST.
 I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO FOLKS AT
 THE WHITE HOUSE, MUCH OF IT OFF
 THE RECORD.
 YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM,
 TOO.
 WHAT DO WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN, OR
 WHAT DO WE THINK THE PRESIDENT
 WILL FOCUS ON TONIGHT?
 THE PRESIDENT WILL FOCUS ON
 UNIFYING OUR NATION AND UNIFYING
 BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES, BUT
 SOME, OF COURSE, SAY THERE ARE
 SOME CREDIBILITY ISSUES THERE
 BECAUSE OF HIS POLITICAL TRACK
 RECORD OF REALLY OFFENDING AND
 GIVING INSULTS TO HIS POLITICAL
 OPPONENTS.
 THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO
 TALK ABOUT A NUMBER OF TOPICS,
 INCLUDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,
 HEALTHCARE COSTS, INCLUDING
 TRADE, AND WARS AND FOREIGN
 POLICY AS WELL AS
 INFRASTRUCTURE.
 HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE AT SOME
 POINT PITCHING AND ASKING
 CONGRESS TO COME UP WITH SOME
 SORT OFEN FRACTURE PLAN.
 THE PRESIDENT'S ALSO SUPPOSED TO
 BE TALKING ABOUT H.I.V./AIDS AND
 TRYING TO END THE@
 OF THAT DEADLY DISEASE BY 2030.
 THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO SUPPOSED
 TO BE TALKING ABOUT HIS IDEAS
 FOR A WAY FORWARD.
 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, THOUGH,
 TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TWEETING
 TODAY AND HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT
 CHUCK SCHUMER'S MAD THAT HE
 DIDN'T WIN THE SENATE.
 HE'S SAID IN THE PAST THAT
 DEMOCRATS DON'T BELIEVE IN
 BORDER SECURITY, SO WHILE THE
 PRESIDENT PUTS FORWARD THIS
 UNIFYING MESSAGE, PEOPLE ARE
 SAYING, JUST LOOK AT WHAT YOU
 TWEETED TODAY THAT WILL BE
 HURTING THAT UNIFYING MESSAGE.
 Woodruff: LISA, WE KNOW THE
 OTHER PARTY ALWAYS PREPARES FOR
 WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO
 SAY.
 WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS SAYING ABOUT
 HOW THEY PLAN TO HANDLE, WHAT
 THEY EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO SAY
 AND HOW THEY WILL RESPOND TO IT?
 DEMOCRATS ARE MORE EXCITED
 ABOUT THIS RESPONSE THAN I'VE
 HEARD THEM IN SOME TIME.
 STACY ABRAMS TO THEM REPRESENTS
 A SHIFT AWAY FROM PLAYING IT
 SAFE.
 THERE IS ONE LONG-TIME
 PROGRESSIVE WHO TOLD ME TONIGHT,
 WE'VE BEEN PLAYING IT TOO SAFE
 AS DEMOCRATS.
 WE WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS A CLEAR,
 AGGRESSIVE AGENDA LIKE STACY
 ABRAMS, WHO TALKS ABOUT VOTER
 RIGHTS.
 SHE ALSO REPRESENTS SOME OTHER
 IMPORTANT THEMES FOR DEMOCRATS
 TONIGHT, DIVERSITY IN TWO WAYS.
 ONE, SHE WILL BE FIRST AFRICAN
 AMERICAN WOMAN TO GIVE A MAJOR
 PARTY RESPONSE.
 ALSO, THOUGH, SHE WILL BE THE
 FIRST NON-ELECTED OFFICIAL.
 SHE NO LONGER HOLDS OFFICE,
 HAVING LOST THE GUBERNATORIAL
 RACE LAST FALL, SHE WILL BE THE
 FIRST NON-ELECTED OFFICIAL TO
 GIVE THIS KIND OF RESPONSE SOME
 A SORT OF OUTSIDER AND ALSO A
 CORE PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC
 BASE.
 THIS ALSO STICKS TO A THEME
 WE'LL SEE VISUALLY ON THE FLOOR,
 DEMOCRATIC WOMEN IN THE HOUSE
 WILL BE WEARING ALL WHITE.
 THEY SAY THAT IS TO SHOW A SIGN,
 A REFERENCE TO THE SUFFER GETS,
 BUT ONE OF THEM TOLD ME IT'S
 SMART VISUAL CUE.
 THEY WANT THE HIGHLIGHT THE
 GIVES BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND
 THEIR INCREASED DIVERSITY THIS
 THIS CONGRESS AND REPUBLICANS,
 WHO HAVE LESS I DIVERSITY IN THS
 CONGRESS.
 Woodruff: LISA, STAYING
 WITH YOU, YAMICHE MENTIONED THE
 PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO TALK
 TONIGHT ABOUT BORDER SECURITY.
 WHAT DO WE KNOW AT THIS POINT
 ABOUT WHERE THE CONFERENCE
 COMMITTEE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE
 FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, THEY
 HAVE A DEADLINE FACING THEM.
 I TALKED TODAY TO SPEAKER PELOSI
 AND MINORITY LEADER CHUCK
 SCHUMER.
 THEY SAID PROGRESS IS BEING
 MADE.
 WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?
 MY REPORTING IS THE SAME.
 TALKING TO OTHER LEADERS AND
 PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE CONFERENCE
 MEE.
 THERE IS REAL PROGRESS ON THE
 STAFF LEVEL.
 THEY THINK THEY COULD COME UP
 WITH A DEAL IF IT IS JUST LEFT
 TO THE MEMBERS OF THE
 APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALONE.
 JUDY, THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
 WILL HAVE AN UNUSUAL MEETING
 TOMORROW MORNING, CLOSED DOOR,
 WITH CAREER BORDER PATROL
 OFFICIALS.
 NOW, IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THAT'S
 CLOSED DOOR, BUT ONE STAFFER
 TOLD ME THAT THEY THINK IT'S
 BECAUSE THEY WANT THE QUESTIONS
 AND ANSWERS TO BE AS FORTHRIGHT
 AS POSSIBLE.
 THEY ARE LOOKING AT TRYING TO
 GET A CONFERENCE REPORT BY THE
 END OF THE WEEK OR THIS WEEKEND
 AT THE LATEST.
 THEY THINK IT'S DOABLE, BUT
 THERE ARE MANY X FACTORS, ONE OF
 THE BIGGEST BEING THE PRESIDENT
 AND WHAT HE SAYS TONIGHT ABOUT
 BORDER SECURITY.
 Woodruff: AND FINALLY,
 YAMICHE, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
 HOW THE PRESIDENT IS PLANNING
 FOR TONIGHT AND ALSO
 TRADITIONALLY THE PRESIDENT HAS
 GUESTS COME TO THE CAPITAL.
 WHO DO WE KNOW THOSE TO BE?
 THE PRESIDENT IS USING
 NATIONAL STAGE TO MAKE THE CASE
 THAT THE STATE OF THE UNION IS
 GREAT BUT THAT IT WOULD BE
 BETTER IF THERE WERE CONCERNS
 MET AND PEOPLE PAID ATTENTION TO
 THE CONCERNS THAT HE HAS.
 RIGHT BEHIND ME AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
 PREPARING AND REALLY USING THIS
 SPEECH AS A WAY TO PREPARE
 HIMSELF TO TALK ON A
 TELEPROMPTER.
 HE HAD A TELEPROMPTER ACTUALLY
 BROUGHT INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, SO
 HE'S GOING TO TRY THE MAKE SURE
 HE'S READING PROPERLY.
 THE OTHER THING HE'S GOING TO BE
 DOING IS BRINGING IN GUESTS.
 THE GUESTS HE'S BRINGING IN ARE
 ONE, FAMILY WHOSE FAMILY MEMBER
 WAS MURDERED OR KILLED BY AN
 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT.
 THE PRESIDENT'S ULTIMATELY
 BRINGING A LITTLE BOY NAMED
 JOSHUA TRUMP WHO WAS BULLIED
 BECAUSE OF HIS LAST NAME, WHICH
 HE PLAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND
 THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO BRINGING
 SOMEONE WHO WAS FREED BY THE
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ACT THAT
 WAS PASSED BY BOTH PARTIES.
 THE PRESIDENT SAYS WE WANTS
 BIPARTISANSHIP.
 THIS PERSON WHO CAME OUT OF
 PRISON IS EMBODYING WHAT WE
 COULD BE DOING IN THE FUTURE.
 YAMICHE ALCINDOR AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE, LISA DESJARDINS AT THE
 CAPITOL.
 WE WILL CERTAINLY COME BACK TO
 THE TWO OF YOU LATER TONIGHT
 WHEN WE HAVE OUR SPECIAL
 COVERAGE.
 THANKS.
 WE WANT THE HEAR FROM LAWMAKERS
 NOW.
 REPRESENTATIVE JAMES CLYBURN OF
 SOUTH CAROLINA IS THE THIRD
 HIGHEST RANKING DEMOCRAT IN THE
 U.S. HOUSE.
 HE JOINS US FROM CAPITOL HILL.
 REPRESENTATIVE CLYBURN, THANK
 YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.
 THANK YOU.
 Woodruff: WHAT ARE YOU
 LOOKING FOR TRUMP TO SAY
 TONIGHT?
 WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING
 US TO CHOOSE GREATNESS, AND I
 WOULD HOPE THAT WE HEAR SOME
 GREATNESS FROM HIM.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN
 READING A LOT OF "DEMOCRACY IN
 AMERICA" OF LATE.
 IT TELLS US THAT AMERICA'S
 GREATNESS IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE
 MORE ENLIGHTENED THAN ANY OTHER
 COUNTRY, BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE
 ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO REPAIR OUR
 FAULTS.
 I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT
 TONIGHT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT
 KIND OF GREATNESS.
 SUPPOSE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN
 DO TO REPAIR OUR FAULTS.
 THEY HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED QUITE
 A BIT IN THE LAST SEVERAL
 MONTHS, AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT
 WHATEVER HE SAYS TONIGHT WILL
 BRING US TOGETHER AS A PEOPLE,
 MOVE US FORWARD AS A COUNTRY,
 AND MAKE US REALLY GREAT.
 Woodruff: WHERE DO YOU SEE
 THERE COULD BE COMMON GROUND?
 WHO WHITE -- THE WHITE HOUSE SAS
 WE'VE TRIED THE MAKE OVERTURES
 TO DEMOCRATS ON BORDER SECURITY.
 THEY HAVEN'T MET EYE TO EYE WITH
 US.
 THEY TICK OFF A NUMBER OVER
 ISSUES WHERE THEY SAY DEMOCRATS
 HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MEET THEM
 HALFWAY.
 WHAT DO YOU -- WHERE DO YOU SEE
 POTENTIAL COMMON GROUND?
 WELL, I THINK THAT THERE'S
 COMMON GROUND TO BE HAD ON
 BORDER SECURITY.
 THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE
 BACKED AWAY FROM HIS CONCRETE,
 30-FOOT-HIGH WALL AND IS NOW
 TALKING ABOUT MORE BROADER
 SECURITY.
 HE'S TALKING ABOUT BARRIERS.
 AND WE TOO HAVE BACKED AWAY FROM
 OUR POSITIONS OF NO MONEY FOR
 ANY KIND OF WALL.
 WE ARE ADVOCATING A SMART WALL,
 USING 21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGY
 TO MAKE THIS WALL AS SMART AS WE
 HAVE MADE OUR TELEPHONES AND OUR
 TELEVISIONS.
 SO WE CAN HAVE A SMART WALL, ONE
 THAT WILL USE DRONES TO KEEP
 ANYBODY FROM FLYING OVER IT, USE
 X-RAY EQUIP TO KEEP ANYBODY FROM
 GETTING AROUND IT, USE SCANNERS
 TO KEEP ANYBODY FROM BURROWING
 UNDER IT UNDETECTED.
 SO WE CAN DO THIS IN A SMART
 WAY.
 I JUST CAME BACK FROM
 BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS.
 WE WERE AT A PORT OFEN TRY.
  -- PORT OF ENTRY.
 I SAW A PORT IN DIRE NEED OF
 RETROFITTING.
 I SAW FENCING THAT'S ALREADY
 THERE IN DIRE NEED OF REPAIRING.
 I DO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO WHAT
 IS NECESSARY TO SECURE OUR
 BORDER, JUST DO IT IN A SMART
 WAY, NOT TO BUILD A MONUMENT TO
 ANYBODY.
 Woodruff: SO TO BE CLEAR,
 YOU'RE SAYING DEMOCRATS, YOU'RE
 THIRD IN LINE IN LEADERSHIP IN
 THE HOUSE, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
 PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE MONEY
 FOR SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL
 BARRIER?
 SO LONG AS IT'S DONE SMARTLY.
 I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL VOTE FOR
 WHATEVER THAT COMMITTEE COMES
 OUT.
 IF THEY COME OUT WITH A
 BIPARTISAN AROACH -- APPROACH TO
 GET THIS DONE, IRRESPECTIVE OF
 HOW THEY PUT IT TOGETHER, I DO
 BELIEVE YOU'LL GET EXTENSIVE
 SUPPORT AMONG DEMOCRATS FOR IT.
 IT MAY NOT BE UNANIMOUS, BUT
 THERE WILL BE A LOT OF UNITY.
 Woodruff: ARE DEMOCRATS
 PREPARED TO SHOW RESPECT TO THE
 PRESIDENT TONIGHT?
 I ASKED THAT, BECAUSE WE
 REMEMBER UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA
 THERE WERE STATE OF THE UNION
 ADDRESSES WHEN MEMBERS CALLED
 OUT TO HIM, ONE OF THEM CALLING
 HIM A LIAR.
 HOW DO YOU SEE TONIGHT GOING?
 I THINK YOU'LL SEE US BEING
 VERY RESPECTFUL.
 YOU KNOW, MY DAD USED TO TEACH
 US ALL THE TIME THAT THE FIRST
 LINE -- SIGN OF A GOOD EDUCATION
 IS GOOD MANNERS.
 SO I TRY TO PUT MY EDUCATION ON
 DISPLAY EVERY TIME I WALK ENTER
 THE HALLS OF CONGRESS OR THE
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
 YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN THAT YELL
 WAS MADE, I'M THE ONE THAT LED
 THE CHARGE TO GET A RESOLUTION
 OF DISAPPROVAL FOR WHAT MY
 COLLEAGUE SAID THAT NIGHT, AND
 IT PASSED THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES, AND I THINK
 THAT WE SHOWED THEN THAT WE
 DISAPPROVE OF SUCH ACTIONS, AND
 WE CERTAINLY ARE NOT GOING TO DO
 ANYTHING TO VIOLATE WHAT WE DID
 LAST YEAR.
 Woodruff: CONGRESSMAN
 CLYBURN, WHAT OTHER AREAS DO YOU
 SEE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
 AND THE WHITE HOUSE WORKING
 TOGETHER ON THIS YEAR?
 OH, I THINK WE CAN DO A
 COMPREHENSIVEN -- COMPREHENSIVE
 INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL.
 I THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR US TO
 DEVELOP OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES.
 WE NEED TO BE PUTTING IN WATER
 AND SEWERS.
 WE NEED TO BE REPAIRING ROADS
 AND BRIDGES.
 WE NEED TO BE BUILDING SCHOOLS
 IN OUR RURAL AREAS.
 WE CAN DO A COMPREHENSIVE BILL
 THAT WOULD HAVE BROAD BAPPED
 DEPLOYMENT GOING INTO THESE
 RURAL COMMUNITIES.
 TOO MANY OF THEM ARE BEING LEFT
 BEHIND.
 WE NEED TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT.
 IT WILL PAY OFF HANDSOMELY IF WE
 DO, AND I REALLY BELIEVE IT CAN
 BE DONE IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.
 Woodruff: CONGRESSMAN JAMES
 CLYBURN, THE WHIP FOR THE
 DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH.
 THANK YOU.
 Woodruff: AS WE HEARD,
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO
 DOUBLE DOWN IN HIS SPEECH
 TONIGHT, CALLING ON CONGRESS TO
 FUND A WALL ALONG THE SOUTHERN
 BORDER.
 ONE OPTION HE HASN'T RULED OUT--
 DECLARING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY
 TO BUILD THE WALL, IS CAUSING A
 SPLIT AMONG SENATE REPUBLICANS.
 SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WARNED
 YESTERDAY THERE COULD BE A WAR
 WITHIN THE G.O.P. OVER THE WALL.
 WE TURN NOW TO ONE OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S STRONGEST ALLIES IN
 CONGAS SENATOR DAVID PERDUE OF
 GEORGIA.
 SENATOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
 JOINING US.
 I THINK YOU WERE THERE.
 WELL, THERE YOU ARE.
 SENATOR, HOW MUCH OF A DIVIDE IS
 THERE STILL DO YOU THINK BETWEEN
 REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS,
 BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND THE WHITE
 HOUSE OVER WHAT IS GOING TO
 HAPPEN WITH REGARD TO A BARRIER,
 A WALL AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER?
 WELL, I HOPE THAT IT'S
 NARROWING, JUDY.
 THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE
 DEALING WITH A TOPIC THAT BOAST
 SIDES ARE MAKING THE SAME
 ARGUMENT I MEAN, THIS IS THE
 FIFTH PRESIDENT IN A ROW THAT'S
 ASKED CONGRESS FOR BORDER
 FUNDING TO BUILD A WALL.
 I MEAN, H.W. BUSH BUILT THE
 FIRST MILE.
 EVEN BARACK OBAMA BUILT 135
 MILES OF WALL.
 BOTH PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS IS
 A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE, AND
 WE NEED TO DO IT NOW.
 THE PROBLEM IS THE HYPOCRISY OF
 POLITICS HAVE BROUGHT US TO THIS
 POINT.
 I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS CONFERENC
 COMMITTEE IS GOING TO GET TO A
 BIPARTISAN SOLUTION HERE THAT WE
 I'M HOPEFUL THAT WILL, JUDY.
 Woodruff: AS YOU KNOW,
 SENATOR, DURING THE CAMPAIGN
 OVER TWO YEARS AGO, THE
 PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT A
 WALL.
 AT TIMES HE SPOKE ABOUT A
 CONCRETE WALL.
 AT TIMES HE SPOKE ABOUT SEA TO
 SHINING SEA.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS CHANGED WHAT
 HE'S ASKING FOR, ISN'T THAT FAIR
 TO SAY?
 THIS IS MAN WHO IS, NUMBER
 ONE, TRYING TO PROTECT THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 HE'S FIGHTING FOR OUR NATIONAL
 SECURITY.
 THERE ARE 2,000 MILES OF THAT
 SOUTHERN BORDER.
 650 MILES, JUDY, ALREADY HAVE
 SOME SORT OF BARRIER ON IT.
 AND HE'S ASKING FOR A LITTLE
 MORE THAN 200 MILES.
 SO I THINK THAT PUTS IT IN
 PERSPECTIVE, BUT HI WANTS IT TO
 BE PUT IN POSITIONS WHERE DRUG
 TRAFFICKING, HUMAN TRAFFICKING,
 AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS
 HAPPENING IN THE MOST SEVERE
 MANNER RIGHT NOW.
 Woodruff: FROM WHAT YOU
 KNOW, WE JUST HEARD CONGRESSMAN
 CLYBURN SAY HE BELIEVES THERE
 CAN BE SUCCESS IN THAT
 CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.
 LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, THEY
 CAN COME UP WITH AN AGREEMENT.
 ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC THAT'S GOING
 THE HAPPEN, AS WELL?
 I'M HOPEFUL.
 I'M NOT SURE I'M OPTIMISTIC YET.
 WE'LL KNOW TOMORROW, BECAUSE
 THESE ARE NON-POLITICAL PEOPLE
 WHO ARE COMING UP TO GIVE SOME
 ADVICE TO THE COMMITTEE.
 I'M HOPEFUL TOMORROW WE'LL HEAR
 SOME STATEMENTS COMING OUT OF
 THAT CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THAT
 WILL GIVE US OPTIMISM ABOUT
 GETTING PAST THIS IMPASSE.
 THE OTHER THING, JUDY, THIS IS
 RIDICULOUS.
 THIS IS AN APPROPRIATION ISSUE
 THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH
 BEFORE SEPTEMBER 30th LAST
 YEAR.
 WE'RE IN THE FIFTH MONTH OF OUR
 NEW FISCAL YEAR.
 SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT EVERYBODY
 WILL GET THIS DONE THIS WEEK.
 Woodruff: I THINK YOU KNOW,
 SENATOR, THE PRESIDENT IS STILL
 NOT RULING OUT THE IDEA OF
 DECLARING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY
 IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD AND BUILD
 THE WALL, PUT MONEY ASIDE TO
 BUILD THE WALL IF THERE IS NO
 AGREEMENT IN CONGRESS.
 BUT HE HAS BEEN TOLD BY SENATE
 MAJORITY LEADER, YOUR COLLEAGUE
 SENATOR McCONNELL, MITCH
 McCONNELL, THAT THAT'S NOT A
 GOOD IDEA.
 DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT STILL
 WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER DOING
 THAT?
 WELL, HE HAS SAID HE WOULD,
 AND I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD, BUT
 AGAIN, THIS IS MAN, I THINK
 TONIGHT IN THE STATE OF THE
 UNION, YOU'LL HEAR PRESIDENT
 TRUMP OFFER A LITTLE MORE
 CONCILIATORY TONE, BECAUSE HE'S
 A DEALMAKER FIRST AND LAST, WE
 ALL KNOW THAT.
 HE JUST WANTS TO GET BORDER
 SECURITY MOVING IN THE RIGHT
 DIRECTION AND BOTH PARTIES
 ACTUALLY WANT THAT.
 SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT TONIGHT
 WE'LL SEE A LITTLE MORE OF THAT.
 AND THEN OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR
 SO, WE'LL SEE SOMETHING COME OUT
 OF THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
 THAT WILL PRECLUDE THE NEED FOR
 THE PRESIDENT TO DO SOMETHING
 EXTREME.
 HE CERTAINLY HAS THE RIGHT TO DO
 IT, BUT I'M HOPEFUL CONGRESS
 WILL STEP IN HERE AND DO ITS
 JOB.
 Woodruff: SENATOR, HOW DOES
 IT CHANGE WHAT THE PRESIDENT CAN
 DO BECAUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOW
 WON THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES?
 HE IS DEALING WITH A DIFFERENT
 CONGRESS THAN HE WAS LAST YEAR.
 WELL, WE HAVE AN HISTORIC
 OPPORTUNITY.
 IF YOU THINK ABOUT TIP O'NEILL
 AND REAGAN, YOU THINK ABOUT NEWT
 GINGRICH AND BILL CLINTON, WHEN
 YOU HAD SPLIT GOVERNMENT IS WHEN
 REALLY BIG THINGS DID HAPPEN
 HERE, SO THE ANSWER IS NANCY
 PELOSI HAS A CHOICE AS THE
 SPEAKER.
 EITHER SHE IS GOING TO WORK WITH
 THIS PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN
 PROVEN HE WILL MAKE A DEAL, AND
 HE DID AN HISTORIC BIPARTISAN
 BILL JUST THIS PAST YEAR, JUDY,
 THAT REALLY HELPED SMALL BANKS.
 I'M LOOKING FOR MORE OF THAT.
 SO I THINK THE SPEAKER HAS TO
 MAKE A DECISION.
 IS SHE GOING TO LEGISLATE WITH
 THIS PRESIDENT, WHO IS MORE THAN
 WILLING TO DO, THAT OR IS SHE
 GOING TO INVESTIGATE GOING INTO
 THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION GOING
 INTO 2020.
 Woodruff: MY QUESTION IS:
 HOW DOES IT CHANGE WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO DO?
 IF THEY DON'T OPERATE WITH
 US, IT MOVES BACK IN THE SENATE,
 ALL WE'LL BE FOCUSED ON IS THE
 CONFIRMATION, AND LEADER
 McCONNELL HAS TALKED ABOUT
 BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT
 GETTING THE CONFIRMATION DONE
 THIS YEAR AND NEXT.
 SO WE KNOW WE CAN DO THAT.
 THAT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE
 SENATE.
 I JUST IMPLORE THE SENATE OR THE
 HOUSE MEMBERS TO PUT PRESSURE ON
 LEADERSHIP THERE.
 LET'S GET TOGETHER AND
 LEGISLATE, WHICH IS WHY THE
 PEOPLE IN AMERICA SENT US UP
 HERE.
 Woodruff: THERE IS A REPORT
 OUT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS,
 SENATOR, ABOUT THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION STILL NOT HAVING
 SUBMITTED NAMES FOR HUNDREDS OF
 EMPTY POSITIONS INSIDE THE
 ADMINISTRATION.
 DO YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR
 WHY THAT IS?
 YEAH, WE'VE HAD AN HISTORIC
 LEVEL OF OBSTRUCTION FIRST OF
 ALL.
 Woodruff: NO, I'M --
 NO, I UNDERSTAND.
 THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE
 CONFIRMED OVER 85 JUDGES, 30
 COURTS OF APPEAL JUDGE, AND TWO
 SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.
 BUT THIS IS AN HISTORIC
 SITUATION, JUDY, WHERE THIS IS
 THE FIRST TIME IN U.S. HISTORY
 THE MINORITY PARTY HAS IN THE
 WAIVED THE 30-HOUR RULE IN THE
 SENATE.
 HAVING SAID THAT, THERE ARE OVER
 300 NOMINATIONS AT THE END OF
 LAST YEAR WAITING TO BE
 CONFIRMED.
 WE NEED TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
 AND GET PAST THIS AND STOP
 PLAYING PARTISAN POLITICS.
 THIS PRESIDENT, IF WE DON'T
 CHANGE THE RULE AND WE DON'T
 MOVE PAST THIS, THIS PRESIDENT
 WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO PUT HIS
 FULL COMPLEMENT OF GOVERNMENT
 TOGETHER.
 Woodruff: I'M ASKING ABOUT
 THOSE POSITIONS FOR WHICH NAMES
 HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN PUT FORWARD
 YET?
 FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE
 PLENTY OF NAMES THAT HAVE BEEN
 BEEN PUT FORWARD THAT HAVE NOT
 BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BECAUSE OF
 THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE DEMOCRATS
 IN THE SENATE.
 WHEN THAT HAPPEN, I CAN PROMISE
 YOU, THIS PRESIDENT WILL LINE
 THEM UP IN TERMS OF NOMINEES
 WAITING TO BE CONFIRMED.
 Woodruff: SENATOR DAVID
 PERDUE OF GEORGIA, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 THANKS, JUDY.
 Woodruff: SO LET'S TAKE A
 STEP BACK NOW AND PUT THIS
 MOMENT IN TONIGHT'S ADDRESS IN
 CONTEXT WITH PRESIDENTIAL
 HISTORIAN AND NEWSHOUR REGULAR
 MICHAEL BESCHLOSS.
 MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, WONDERFUL TO
 SEE YOU.
 WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU ALWAYS.
 Woodruff: THANK YOU FOR
 BEING HERE.
 THANK YOU, JUDY.
 Woodruff: SO YOU'VE LOOKED
 AT HOW PRESIDENTS HAVE HANDLED
 TIMES OF STRESS, TIMES WHEN THEY
 ARE FACING OPPOSITION, WHETHER
 NEW OR LONGSTANDING.
 THAT SEEMS TO BE CERTAINLY WHAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FACING
 TONIGHT.
 HOW HAVE OTHER PRESIDENTS
 HANDLED IT?
 WELL, OFTENTIMES THEY'VE MADE
 A PIVOT.
 BILL CLINTON, FOR INSTANCE, IN
 1996 WAS ACTED TO RUN FOR
 REELECTION, AND TWO YEARS
 EARLIER HE HAD LOST CONGRESS TO
 THE REPUBLICANS FIRST■ TIME IN 0
 YEARS.
 THAT WAS A VERY BIG EVENT.
 SO HE SAID, WE REMEMBER IT NOW,
 THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS
 OVER.
 THAT WORKED FOR HIM BECAUSE
 PEOPLE KNEW THAT FOR THE YEAR
 SINCE THE ELECTION, HE HAD BEEN
 MOVING STEADILY TO THE RIGHT OR
 AT LEAST TO THE CENTER FOR WHEN
 HE SAID THOSE WORDS, IT HAS SOME
 MEANING.
 IT HELPED TO POSITION HIM TO RUN
 SUCCESSFULLY FOR REELECTION AND
 ALSO I WAS INTERESTED THAT
 SENATOR PERDUE WAS TALKING ABOUT
 NEWT GINGRICH AND BILL CLINTON.
 THAT STATE OF THE UNION SET THAT
 UP FOR CLINTON AND GINGRICH BY
 THE SUMMER OF 1996 TO DO WELFARE
 REFORM TOGETHER, TO BALANCE THE
 BUDGET.
 IT REALLY CHANGED THE POLITICAL
 ATMOSPHERE.
 Woodruff: IS THERE A
 PRECEDENT, MICHAEL BESCHLOSS,
 FOR PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN AT
 LOGGERHEADS WITH THE CONGRESS
 TURNING THE CORNER AND SETTING
 THE STAGE FOR THERE TO BE
 REAL -- AN ABILITY TO WORK
 TOGETHER?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 1947, HARRY TRUMAN WENT TO GIVE
 THE STATE OF THE UNION AFTER HE
 LOST CONGRESS TO THE REPUBLICANS
 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 16 YEARS.
 HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A BIG
 NECESSITY FOR HIM TO MAKE DEALS
 WITH THE REPUBLICANS, TO PREPARE
 THE NATION TO FIGHT THE COLD
 WAR, AND THE TRY TO GET SOME OF
 THE DOMESTIC LAWS HE WANTED.
 HE FAILED AT THE LATTER.
 Woodruff: DO YOU SENSE
 AGAIN, FROM STUDIED HISTORY,
 STUDIED SO MANY PRESIDENTS, THAT
 THERE IS A WILLINGNESS, A WILL
 ON THE PART OF THE TWO PARTIES
 THAT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING EACH
 OTHER FOR WEEK AFTER WEEK, DAY
 AFTER DAY, TO COME TOGETHER?
 I THINK THEY KNOW THAT AN
 AWFUL LOT OF AMERICANS WOULD
 LIKE TO SEE THAT.
 THAT SURELY SHOWS UP IN THE
 POLLS.
 BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH SIGN
 OF IT DURING THE LAST MONTH, AND
 WE WILL SEE IF THIS SPEECH
 CHANGES THE ATMOSPHERE I THINK
 RARELY IN HISTORY DOES THAT
 HAPPEN.
 Woodruff: AND THAT'S WHAT I
 WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT, TOO.
 HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE CAN ONE
 SPEECH, ONE GRANTED -- THIS IS A
 BIG DEAL, IT'S THE STATE OF THE
 UNION, IT'S A WHOLE LOT OF
 TRADITION WRAPPED AROUND THIS.

 SURE.
 Woodruff: CAN ONE ADDRESS
 MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
 IF PEOPLE HAVE THE FEELING
 THAT LURKING WITHIN DONALD TRUMP
 HAS BEEN THIS DEEP DESIRE TO
 MAKE DEALS WITH THE OTHER SIDE
 THAT HAS NOT EXPRESSED ITSELF,
 AND HE TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN, 2016, A LOT
 OF PEOPLE VOTED FOR TRUMP,
 BECAUSE THEY SAID I KNOW CHUCK
 SCHUMER, I CAN MAKE DEALS WITH
 HIM, AND THEY FEEL IN MANY CASES
 THAT IT HASN'T BEEN EXPRESSED,
 IF WE BEGIN TO SEE SIGNS OF THAT
 DONALD TRUMP IN THE WAKE OF THIS
 SPEECH, THINGS COULD BEGIN TO
 CHANGE.
 I'M NOT PREDICTING THAT.
 Woodruff: WHY NOT?
 BECAUSE THIS SPEECH WAS
 PRECEDED BY AN ENORMOUS
 CONFRONTATION, ONE OF THE
 BIGGEST IN LEGISLATIVE WHITE
 HOUSE RELATIONS HISTORY, THAT
 LED TO A SHUTDOWN AND MAY YET
 AGAIN.
 Woodruff: JUST VERY
 QUICKLY, YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THE
 LANGUAGE THIS PRESIDENT USE, THE
 WAY HE COMMUNICATES WITH THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 DO YOU -- HOW MUCH DO YOU EXPECT
 HIM TO STAY IN THAT LANE, AND
 HOW MUCH MIGHT HE --
 NOT FOR LONG.
 HE DOESN'T ENJOY IT.
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN MANY INSTANCES
 OF IT.
 IF WE DID, THE TIME WE WOULD
 HAVE SEEN IT WAS DURING THE
 INAUGURATION WHEN EVEN THE MOST
 PARTISAN PRESIDENTS GIVE A
 UNIFYING SPEECH.
 HE WOULD BE FIRST TO SAY HE DID
 NOT.
 Woodruff: MICHAEL
 BESCHLOSS, THANK YOU.
 MY PLEASURE.
 Woodruff: APPRECIATE IT.
 Woodruff: NOW, PERSPECTIVE ON
 THE RUN-UP TO TONIGHT'S BIG
 ADDRESS, FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF
 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SPECTRUM:
 KARINE JEAN-PIERRE IS A SENIOR
 ADVISER FOR moveon.org.
 AND CHRIS BUSKIRK IS EDITOR OF
 THE CONSERVATIVE JOURNAL AND
 WEBSITE "AMERICAN GREATNESS."
 HELLO TO BOTH OF YOU.
 HI.
 Woodruff: GREAT TO HAVE YOU
 BATH ON THE PROGRAM.
 CHRIS, TO YOU FIRST, CHRIS
 BUSKIRK, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE
 PRESIDENT TO DO TONIGHT?
 I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT
 WILL DO TONIGHT IS HE IS GOING
 TO DO WHAT HE'S DONE I THINK
 PRETTY WELL IN SOME SPEECHES
 BEFORE, WHICH IS GOING BACK TO
 PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT.
 HERE'S WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN
 MY CAMPAIGN, HERE'S WHAT I'VE
 ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR, HERE'S WHAT
 I STILL NEED TO DO.
 HERE WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH
 FIRST TERM.
 THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE PIVOT TO
 REELECTION, TO TRY TO START TO
 SET THE TONE AND SET THE
 TRAJECTORY FOR A MESSAGE THAT'S
 GOING TO CARRY HIM THROUGH
 NOVEMBER OF 2020.
 I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE ONE BIG
 UNIFYING THEME THAT SAYS, ON
 IMMIGRATION, ON TRADE, ON
 FOREIGN POLICY, HOW ARE ALL
 THESE THINGS LINKED TOGETHER?
 WHAT'S THAT UNIFYING THEME?
 I THINK THAT THAT THEME HAS TO
 BE HOW DO YOU REBUILD THE MIDDLE
 CLASS.
 Woodruff: THAT'S NUMBER
 ONE.
 I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE GOING TO
 TRY TO DO.
 Woodruff: IF THAT'S WHAT HE
 DOES, KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, HOW IS
 THAT RECEIVED BY DEMOCRATS?
 SO I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN
 REPORTED THAT FROM THE
 ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE WHITE
 HOUSE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
 GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH ON UNITY,
 ON GREATNESS, ON BIPARTISANSHIP,
 AND THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF HE
 WAS ABLE TO DO THAT, BUT WE HAVE
 NOT SEEN THAT FROM THIS
 PRESIDENT IN THE PAST NOW GOING
 ON THREE YEARS.
 AND I JUST DON'T SEE THIS SPEECH
 ONLY BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL
 LANDMARK TRY OF HIS RECORD BEING
 THAT IMPACTFUL.
 SO MAYBE, MAYBE HE GETS THERE
 AND HE MAKES THE SPEECH, BUT
 HOURS LATER, THE MOMENT HE GETS
 ON TWITTER, HE STEPS ON IT.
 SO IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.
 AND LET'S NOT FORGET, A COUPLE
 WEEKS AGO HE ADDRESSED THE
 COUNTRY IN DIPLOMATIC RECEPTION
 ROOM WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT
 IMMIGRATION, AND THAT WAS FILLED
 WITH DIVISION.
 AND THEN HE DID IT WEEKS PRIOR
 THE THAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE
 BEHIND THE RESOLUTE DESK.
 THAT WAS FILLED WITH DIVISION
 AND HATE.
 SO I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S
 POSSIBLE COMING FROM THIS
 PRESIDENT.
 Woodruff: IN FACT, CHRIS
 BUSKIRK, I HAD A CHANCE TODAY TO
 SPEND A LITTLE BIT -- A FEW
 MINUTES WITH SPEAKER PELOSI AND
 SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK
 SCHUMER.
 SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER MADE A
 POINT OF SAYING, WE HOPE THE
 PRESIDENT WILL APPEAL THE UNITY,
 BUT IN THE PAST WHEN HE'S SPOKEN
 AT A MOMENT, WHETHER IT'S A
 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS OR
 ANOTHER IMPORTANT SPEECH, HE'S
 MADE PROMISES OR MADE
 DECLARATIONS THAT HE THEN TURNED
 AROUND AND DIDN'T FULFILL.
 SO WHAT MAKES YOU CONVINCED THAT
 TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE
 DIFFERENT.
 WELL, I THINK PART OF THAT IS
 IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.
 WHAT IS UNITY.
 THERE'S PART OF IT THAT IS THE
 ART OF PERSUASION, WHICH IS TO
 TALK ABOUT IT AND TO USE THE
 RHETORIC OF UNITY AND TO TALK
 ABOUT HOW DO WE -- HOW ARE WE
 AMERICANS TOGETHER.
 HOW DO WE BILL THINGS TOGETHER,
 MAKE THIS A BETTER SOCIETY.
 HOW THAT TRANSLATES INTO
 PRACTICE IS I THINK WHERE THE
 PRESIDENT NEEDS TO BE VERY
 CONCRETE.
 HE NEEDS THE USE THE RHETORIC
 AND SAY, THESE ARE THE POLICIES
 WE'LL PURSUE IN MY
 ADMINISTRATION THE TRY TO MAKE
 THIS A REALITY.
 THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS REALLY
 LOOKING FOR.
 THIS IS A GOOD SPEECH.
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT
 IT.
 Woodruff: BUT YOU HAVE A
 SENSE THAT NOW, CHRIS BUSKIRK,
 THE PRESIDENT IS PREPARED TO DO
 THAT?
 I THINK HE HAS TO, AND I
 THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S GOING TO
 TRY TO DO.
 Woodruff: KARINE, YOU'RE
 EXPRESSING DOUBT?
 HE DOESN'T HAVE A
 RECORD-OF-THAT, JUDY.
 HE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT.
 A YEAR AGO HE TALKED ABOUT
 UNITY.
 MONTHS LATER WE GOT THE ZERO
 POLICY SITUATION WHERE CHILDREN
 OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WERE
 BEING RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR
 PARENTS.
 THAT WAS DEVASTATEING TO SEE.
 NOW WE'RE HEARING MANY OF THEM
 WILL NEVER BE REUNITED.
 THE YEAR BEFORE THAT IN 2017, IN
 THE JOINT ADDRESS, THE SAME
 THING, AND WHAT DID WE SEE?
 WE HEARD ABOUT CHARLOTTESVILLE.
 AND WHAT DID HE DO THERE?
 HE SAID VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH
 SIDES.
 I JUST DON'T SEE IT.
 Woodruff: WHEN YOU HEAR
 THIS, CHRIS BUSKIRK, WHAT DO YOU
 THINK?
 I THINK THAT UNITY DOES NOT
 MEAN AGREEMENT ON EVERYTHING.
 AND THAT'S OKAY.
 THAT'S WHAT POLITICS IS FOR.
 I THINK WHAT UNITY MEANS IS NOT
 THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS TO
 SPEAKER PELOSI, WHATEVER YOU
 WANT, THAT'S FINE.
 I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS HOW DO
 WE IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS THE
 COUNTRY FACES AND HOW DO WE WORK
 TOGETHER, AND WE CAN DISAGREE ON
 OTHER THINGS, BUT LET'S DO THAT
 IN A WAY WHERE WE AT LEAST SET
 THE TABLE ON COMMON GOALS.
 Brangham: AND I GUESS THE
 FLIP SIDE OF THAT QUESTION
 KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, ARE
 DEMOCRATS, ARE PEOPLE LIKE YOU,
 WHO WORK HARD FOR THE
 ORGANIZATIONS THAT OPPOSE SO
 MUCH OF THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES
 RUSSIA YOU WILLING TO GIVE THE
 PRESIDENT THE BENEFIT OF THE
 DOUBT.
 THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN
 WORK ON THAT'S BIPARTISAN, WHICH
 IS DACA, INFRASTRUCTURE,
 IMMIGRATION FOR YOUNG
 UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS WHO CAME
 HERE, YOU KNOW, WITH THEIR
 PARENTS WHEN THEY WERE REALLY
 YOUNG.
 AND THERE IS ALSO THE CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE.
 RIGHT?
 THAT WAS DONE IN A BIPARTISAN
 WAY.
 IT WAS A FIRST STEP.
 THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE.
 THE PROBLEM IS, AND WHAT WE SAID
 EARLIER, HE DECLARES THINGS IN
 HIS SPEECH, BUT THEN HE DOESN'T
 STICK TO THEM.
 AND I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE READY
 TO WORK ON THOSE THINGS, BUT HE
 DOESN'T STICK TO IT.
 Woodruff: I WANT TO LOOK AT
 THIS, STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT,
 CHRIS BUSKIRK, BECAUSE PART OF
 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS MANY OF
 THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THE
 PRESIDENT DON'T SEEM TO WANT HIM
 TO COOPERATE WITH THE OTHER SIDE
 AND, KARINE, I THINK YOU CAN SAY
 THAT ABOUT A NUMBER OF
 PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
 WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE THEIR
 PARTY COOPERATE.
 WHAT ABOUT THAT, CHRIS?
 THE BEST WAY FOR ME AT LEAST
 TO THINK ABOUT IT IS TO USE A
 CON EXREET ILLUSTRATION.
 SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE
 IMMIGRATION ISSUE.
 THIS IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE
 LIKE SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY
 LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, TEN YEARS
 AGO, 12 YEARS AGO, WE NEED A
 WALL, WE NEED BOARDER SECURITY.
 I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS
 TO DO IS EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S
 IMPORTANT AND HOW THAT IS
 SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS, HOW
 BORDER SECURITY PROTECTS WORKING
 FAMILIES.
 AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES.
 WHY?
 BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THEIR MOST
 VALUABLE ASSET, WHICH IS THEIR
 ASYMMETRIC ACCESS TO THE
 AMERICAN LABOR MARKET.
 MAKE THAT ARGUMENT MAYBE IN A
 MORE --
 Woodruff: IN OTHER WORDS,
 IMMIGRANTS TAKE JOBS AWAY FROM
 YOU?
 TAKE JOBS AWAY, LOWER WAGE,
 MORE SUPPLY LOWERS PRICES.
 THAT'S BASIC.
 YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO PEOPLE AND
 SAY, THIS IS WHY IMMIGRATION IS
 IMPORTANT TO ME.
 THIS IS WHY TRADE POLICY IS
 IMPORTANT TO ME.
 I WANT MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES TO
 BE SECURE ECONOMICALLY, AND THEY
 NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROSPER.
 Woodruff: KARINE, THE FLIP
 SIDE, LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DON'T
 WANT THEIR PARTY LEADERS TO WORK
 TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT.
 WELL, THEY WANT DEMOCRATS, IN
 PARTICULAR IN THE HOUSE NOW THAT
 IT'S THE MAJORITY, TO HOLD THIS
 PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE.
 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
 WE TOOK BACK THE HOUSE.
 SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
 THAT LOOKS IN VERY DIFFERENT
 WAYS.
 THAT'S LOOKING AT THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 IT'S ALSO LOOKING AT CHILDREN
 BEING SEPARATED AT THE BORDER.
 PUERTO RICO, 3,000 PEOPLE DIED.
 BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE
 DEMOCRATS MOVING THE COUNTRY
 FORWARD, RIGHT?
 AND THEY'VE DONE THAT WITH
 VOTING RIGHTS AND DEALING WITH
 CORRUPTION, AND SO THESE ARE
 THINGS THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO
 SEE, BUT WE NEED POLITICIANS ON
 THE OTHER SIDE TO ALSO BE IN
 THERE WITH US, TOO.
 Woodruff: ALL RIGHT.
 WE'LL HAVE CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT
 ALL THIS AGAIN LATER TONIGHT
 WHEN WE'VE HEARD WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH, KARINE
 JEAN-PIERRE, CHRIS BUSKIRK.
 THANK YOU.
 Woodruff: FOR A ROUNDUP OF TODAY'S OTHER MAJOR HEADLINES,
 HERE'S AMNA NAWAZ.
 Nawaz: IN THE NON STATE OF
 THE UNION NEWS THIS DAY, THE
 WHITE HOUSE PLAYED DOWN A
 FEDERAL SUBPOENA SEEKING A HOST
 OF DOCUMENTS FROM PRESIDENT
 TRUMP'S INAUGURAL COMMITTEE.
 FEDERAL PROSECUTORS IN NEW YORK
 ARE INVESTIGATING WHO GAVE THE
 MONEY AND WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
 RECEIVED IN RETURN.
 WHITE HOUSE SPOKESWOMAN SARAH
 SANDERS CALLED IT "HYSTERIA"
 OVER THE FACT THAT MR. TRUMP WAS
 ELECTED.
 THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
 DO WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND I
 THINK THE BIGGEST FOCUS AND THE
 THING THAT MOST AMERICANS CARE
 ABOUT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
 INAUGURAL AND IT HAS EVERYTHING
 TO DO WITH WHAT THE PATH FORWARD
 LOOKS LIKE.
 Nawaz: INVESTIGATORS ARE ALSO
 LOOKING INTO WHETHER ANY FOREIGN
 DONORS ILLEGALLY CONTRIBUTED TO
 THE INAUGURAL COMMITTEE.
 ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 JUDICIAL NOMINEES VOICED REGRETS
 TODAY FOR HER PAST STATEMENTS ON
 RAPE, RACE AND EQUAL RIGHTS.
 NEOMI RAO APPEARED BEFORE THE
 SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
 SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES
 CRITICIZED HER FOR WRITING, IN
 COLLEGE, THAT WOMEN BEAR SOME
 BLAME IF THEY'RE SEXUALLY
 ASSAULTED WHILE INTOXICATED.
 TO BE HONEST LOOKING BACK AT
 SOME OF THOSE WRITINGS AND RE-
 READING THEM I CRINGE AT SOME OF
 THE LANGUAGE THAT I USED.
 I'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
 SINCE THAT TIME WRITING IN
 COLLEGE AND I DON'T THINK I
 WOULD EXPRESS MYSELF IN THE SAME
 WAY THESE ARE HORRIBLE CRIMES
 AND I WOULDN'T WRITE ANYTHING
 THAT WOULD IMPLY TO BLAME A
 VICTIM OR MAKE IT LESS LIKELY
 FOR A VICTIM TO COME FORWARD.
 Nawaz: RAO CURRENTLY LEADS
 THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE
 OVERSEEING DEREGULATION.
 IF CONFIRMED, SHE'D TAKE THE
 FEDERAL APPEALS COURT SEAT HELD
 BY BRETT KAVANAUGH, BEFORE HE
 JOINED THE SUPREME COURT.
 OVERSEAS, IN AFGHANISTAN,
 TALIBAN ATTACKS KILLED NEARLY 50
 PEOPLE IN TWO NORTHERN
 PROVINCES.
 A PRE-DAWN RAID KILLED 26
 SOLDIERS AND POLICE AT AN ARMY
 BASE IN KUNDUZ PROVINCE, ON THE
 OUTSKIRTS OF KUNDUZ CITY.
 ATTACKS IN NEIGHBORING PROVINCES
 KILLED 21 OTHERS.
 THE TALIBAN HAVE KEPT UP THEIR
 OFFENSIVE, EVEN AMID EARLY
 STAGES OF PEACE TALKS WITH THE
 U.S.
 THE TOP U.S. COMMANDER IN THE
 MIDDLE EAST SAYS PRESIDENT TRUMP
 DID NOT TALK TO HIM BEFORE
 ANNOUNCING AMERICAN FORCES WILL
 WITHDRAW FROM SYRIA.
 ARMY GENERAL JOSEPH VOTEL
 TESTIFIED AT A SENATE HEARING
 TODAY, AND WAS QUESTIONED BY
 MAINE SENATOR ANGUS KING.
 GENERAL, WERE YOU AWARE OF
 THE PRESIDENT'S INTENTION TO
 ORDER THE WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS
 FROM SYRIA BEFORE THAT WAS
 PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED?
 I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE
 SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENT.
 CERTAINLY WE ARE AWARE THAT HE
 HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE AND A
 INTENT IN THE PAST TO DEPART
 IRAQ-- TO DEPART SYRIA.
 SO YOU WERE NOT CONSULTED
 BEFORE THAT DECISION WAS MADE?
 WE WERE NOT-- I WAS NOT
 CONSULTED
 Nawaz: VOTEL'S REMARKS CAME A
 DAY AFTER THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
 WARNED THAT ISLAMIC STATE
 FIGHTERS COULD RE-SURGE IN SYRIA
 AFTER THE U.S. WITHDRAWS.
 POPE FRANCIS HAS CELEBRATED THE
 FIRST-EVER PAPAL MASS ON THE
 ARABIAN PENINSULA.
 SOME 180,000 PEOPLE GATHERED
 TODAY AT A SPORTS STADIUM IN ABU
 DHABI, CAPITAL OF THE UNITED
 ARAB EMIRATES.
 FRANCIS PREACHED HUMILITY, IN
 ONE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST
 NATIONS.
 (<i> translated</i> ): FOR JESUS, ON
 THE OTHER HAND, BLESSED ARE THE
 POOR, THE MEEK, THOSE WHO REMAIN
 JUST EVEN AT THE COST OF
 APPEARING IN A BAD LIGHT, THOSE
 WHO ARE PERSECUTED.
 HE TAUGHT US THAT GREATNESS IS
 NOT FOUND IN HAVING BUT RATHER
 IN GIVING.
 Nawaz: LATER, THE POPE
 ACKNOWLEDGED, FOR THE FIRST
 TIME, THE SCANDAL OF PRIESTS
 SEXUALLY ABUSING NUNS.
 HE SAID HE IS COMMITTED TO
 FIGHTING THE PROBLEM.
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN ASIA AND
 AROUND THE WORLD MARKED THE
 LUNAR NEW YEAR TODAY.
 IN TAIWAN, THOUSANDS GATHERED TO
 PRAY AT A BUDDHIST TEMPLE.
 IN THE PHILIPPINES, PEOPLE
 BOUGHT ROASTED PIG, A DELICACY,
 TO USHER IN THE "YEAR OF THE
 PIG."
 AND ALL ACROSS CHINA, CROWDS
 VISITED TEMPLES AND TOOK PART IN
 FESTIVALS.
 BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, TEXAS
 LAWMAKERS COMPLAINED TODAY THE
 STATE STILL HAS NOT RECEIVED
 HURRICANE "HARVEY" RECOVERY
 FUNDS.
 THE STORM DID MAJOR DAMAGE
 IN 2017, AND LAST FEBRUARY,
 CONGRESS EARMARKED SOME $4.4
 BILLION FOR TEXAS, BUT NO GRANTS
 HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN MADE.
 THE STATE'S REPUBLICAN SENATORS,
 PLUS 10 HOUSE MEMBERS FROM BOTH
 PARTIES, SAY FEDERAL BUDGET
 BUREAUCRACY IS STANDING IN THE
 WAY.
 AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE WORLD
 BANK, DAVID MALPASS, LOOKS LIKE
 HE'LL BE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 CHOICE TO LEAD THE AGENCY.
 IT WAS WIDELY REPORTED TODAY
 THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL NOMINATE
 HIM THIS WEEK.
 THE WORLD BANK PROVIDES LOANS
 FOR PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD,
 BUT MALPASS HAS COMPLAINED IT IS
 PILING UP DEBT WITHOUT RESULTS.
 ALSO TODAY, ANDREW WHEELER WON A
 SENATE COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL TO
 BE HEAD OF THE E.P.A.
 HIS NOMINATION NOW GOES TO THE
 FULL SENATE.
 AND, ON WALL STREET, A SERIES OF
 STRONG EARNINGS REPORTS GAVE
 STOCKS ANOTHER BOOST.
 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
 GAINED 172 POINTS TO CLOSE AT

 THE NASDAQ ROSE 54 POINTS, AND
 THE S&P 500 ADDED 12.
 STILL TO COME ON THE NEWSHOUR:
 REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT'S
 COMMENTS THAT THE U.S. WILL USE
 A BASE IN IRAQ TO KEEP EYES ON
 IRAN.
 A RIGOROUS PROGRAM PREPARES
 BLACK UNDERGRADUATES TO GO ON TO
 MEDICAL SCHOOL.
 PLUS, ESSAYIST RACHEL KAADZI
 GHANSAH GIVES HER BRIEF BUT
 SPECTACULAR TAKE ON
 FEARLESSNESS.
 Woodruff: AS WE REPORTED, THE TOP U.S. MILITARY COMMANDER FOR
 THE MIDDLE EAST WAS ON CAPITOL
 HILL TODAY.
 IN ADDITION TO THE FIGHT AGAINST
 ISIS, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT RECENT
 COMMENTS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP
 SUGGESTING AMERICAN TROOPS IN
 IRAQ COULD SHIFT THEIR MISSION.
 AND AS NICK SCHIFRIN REPORTS,
 THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT U.S. TROOPS
 WATCHING IRAN, HAVE SPARKED DEEP
 CONCERN IN IRAQ.
 Schifrin: NEAR THE IRAQI-
 SYRIAN BORDER, AN IRAQI SOLDIER,
 AND HIS AMERICAN ADVISOR, LINE
 UP ARTILLERY TO STRIKE ISIS.
 OUTSIDE BAGHAD, U.S. SPECIAL
 OPERATIONS FORCES TRAIN IRAQ'S
 ELITE COUNTER-TERRORISM SERVICE.
 AND IRAQI SOLDIERS LEARN TO FIRE
 AMERICAN RIFLES, WITH OVERSIGHT
 FROM ANTI-ISIS COALITION TROOPS.
 THESE SCENES OF PARTNERSHIP,
 FILMED BY THE U.S. MILITARY OVER
 THE LAST YEAR, SHOW WHAT IRAQ
 HAS INVITED THE U.S. TO DO.
 5200 U.S. TROOPS TRAIN IRAQI
 SECURITY FORCES, AND TARGET ISIS
 FIGHTERS WHO LOST TERRITORY, BUT
 RESUMED INSURGENT TACTICS.
 BUT THIS WEEKEND, PRESIDENT
 TRUMP TOLD CBS' MARGARET BRENNAN
 THE MISSION SHOULD EXPAND.
 AND ONE OF THE REASONS I WANT
 TO KEEP IT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO
 BE LOOKING A LITTLE BIT AT IRAN
 BECAUSE IRAN IS A REAL PROBLEM.
 WHOA, THAT'S NEWS.
 YOU'RE KEEPING TROOPS IN IRAQ
 BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO
 STRIKE IN IRAN?
 NO, BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE
 TO WATCH IRAN.
 ALL I WANT TO DO IS BE ABLE TO
 WATCH.
 Schifrin: BUT EVEN WATCHING
 IRAN EXCEEDS THE TASKS IRAQ HAS
 APPROVED.
 HE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 (<i> TRANSLATED</i> ): I DON'T THINK
 SUCH STATEMENTS ARE USEFUL.
 IN FACT, THEY WON'T HELP MUCH.
 I HOPE HE WOULD BACK DOWN FROM
 THERE.
 A N A STATEMENT, FIRST DEPUTY
 SPEAKER REPEATED A VOW THAT
 PARLIAMENT WOULD PASS A LAW
 TERMINATING THE SECURITY
 AGREEMENT WITH AMERICA, IN
 ADDITION TO ENDING THE PRESENCE
 OF AMERICAN MILITARY TRAINERS
 AND ADVISERS AND FORT PIERCERS
 ON IRAQI SOIL.
 IN A LEBANON-BASED TV NETWORK ON
 SUNDAY, A IRANIAN-BACKED
 SPOKESMAN HINTED MILITIAS HAD
 THE CAPACITY TO EVICT THE U.S.
 (<i> TRANSLATED</i> ): ALL OF OUR
 OPTIONS ARE OPEN IN FRONT OF US.
 WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND
 RESOURCES TO EXECUTE THEM.
 WHAT THE PRESIDENT REMARKS
 HAVE DONE IS MAKE IT MORE
 DIFFICULT FOR EVEN AMERICA'S
 CLOSEST ALLIES IN THE IRAQI
 POLITICAL CLASS TO CONTINUE TO
 ADVOCATE FOR THE AMERICAN
 PRESENCE IN IRAQ.
 Schifrin: FEISAL ISTRABADI IS
 A FORMER IRAQI DIPLOMAT AND
 DIRECTS INDIANA UNIVERSITY'S
 CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF THE
 MIDDLE EAST.
 THE IRAQI PARLIAMENT WAS ALREADY
 DEBATING A BILL THAT WOULD EVICT
 THE U.S., IN RESPONSE TO
 THAT MOMENTUM WILL INCREASE AND
 PUT PRESSURE ON PRIME MINISTER
 ADIL ABDUL MAHDI, WHO LEADS A
 GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED
 TECHNICALLY CAPABLE, BUT HAS NO
 NATURAL CONSTITUENCY.
 HE WAS TURNED TO BY THE
 POLITICAL PARTIES IN PARLIAMENT
 AND ASKED TO FORM A GOVERNMENT.
 HE IS IN THAT SENSE A RELATIVELY
 WEAK PRIME MINISTER.
 YOU DON'T WANT THE PRIME
 MINISTER IN A POLITICAL BATTLE
 WITH PARLIAMENT BECAUSE IN THE
 IRAQI SYSTEM, THE PRIME MINSTER
 WILL ALWAYS LOSE.
 Schifrin: TODAY, THE TOP
 COMMANDER IN THE MIDDLE EAST
 TRIED TO REASSURE THAT THE U.S.
 RESPECTED IRAQI WISHES.
 OUR MILITARY MISSION ON THE
 GROUND REMAINS VERY FOCUSED ON
 THE REASON THAT THE GOVERNMENT
 OF IRAQ ASKED US TO COME THERE.
 Schifrin: AND HE SUGGESTED
 THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS HAD NOT
 BECOME A MILITARY ORDER.
 VIRGINIA SENATOR TIM KAINE:
 AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THERE'S
 NOT A CHANGE IN THE DEFINITION
 OF THE MISSION, AT LEAST AS FAR
 AS THE PENTAGON IS CONCERNED?
 I HAVE NO ADDITIONAL TASKS
 THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ME WITH
 REGARD TO THAT.
 IF THE U.S. WERE TO CHANGE
 ITS DEFINITION OF THE MISSION IN
 IRAQ, TO BE A MISSION ABOUT
 WATCHING IRAN, WOULDN'T IT BE
 PRETTY IMPORTANT TO HAVE IRAQ
 AGREE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE
 FOCUS OF THE MISSION IF WE WERE
 TO BE HAVING TROOPS IN THEIR
 COUNTRY TO CARRY OUT SUCH A
 MISSION?
 SENATOR, WE ARE IN IRAQ AT
 THE INVITATION OF THE
 GOVERNMENT, SO YES, I WOULD
 AGREE.
 Schifrin: ABBAS KADHIM IS
 FORMER IRAQI DIPLOMAT AND LEADS
 THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S IRAQ
 INITIATIVE.
 HE SAYS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ORDER
 IRAN SAYS THEY DO NOW USE THE
 IRAQ I CAN CONSTITUTION TO ARGUE
 AGAINST THE U.S. PRESENCE,
 BECAUSE IT REQUIRES IRAQ TO
 ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF
 NON-INTERFERENCE WITH OTHER
 STATES.
 IRAN HAS MORE FRIENDS INSIDE
 IRAQI PARLIAMENT AND ALSO INSIDE
 THE GOVERNMENT AND INSIDE EVEN
 THE PUBLIC, AND THESE FRIENDS
 ARE WILLING TO INDULGE IRAN.
 BEFORE SUNDAY THEY DID NOT HAVE
 THE VOTES.
 NOW I AM TOLD BY SOME PARLIAMENT
 MEMBERS THAT THEY HAVE THE VOTES
 AT LEAST TO HAVE IT PASS THROUGH
 FIRST READING.
 THAT IS MAJOR SHIFT.

 Schifrin: IRAQI LEADERS SAY
 THEY KNEW ALL ALONG U.S. TROOPS
 IN IRAQ WERE LIKELY CONDUCTING
 EXTRA MISSIONS, EVEN WATCHING
 IRAN.
 BUT UNTIL SUNDAY, THAT WASN'T
 MADE PUBLIC.
 THAT VEIL OF PLAUSIBLE
 DENIABILITY, OR WILLFUL
 IGNORANCE, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
 CALL IT, THAT'S BEEN LIFTED.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED WHAT
 HIS AGENDA ACTUALLY IS.
 Schifrin: AND THAT MEANS
 THERE WILL BE A FIGHT OVER U.S.
 FOR THE PBS NEWSHOUR, I'M NICK
 SCHIFRIN.
 Woodruff: WHILE VIRGINIA GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM WEIGHS
 WHETHER TO RESIGN, REACTION AND
 ANGER KEEPS BUILDING OVER THE
 RACIST PHOTO IN HIS MEDICAL
 SCHOOL YEARBOOK.
 ONE IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS
 HOW IT SERVES AS A REMINDER OF
 RACISM IN MEDICINE HISTORICALLY.
 WE'VE REPORTED ON THE IMPORTANCE
 OF TRAINING MORE AFRICAN-
 AMERICANS TO BECOME DOCTORS.
 AND TONIGHT WE HAVE A SECOND
 LOOK AT A STORY ON XAVIER
 UNIVERSITY, A SMALL HISTORICALLY
 BLACK COLLEGE THAT IS HELPING TO
 LEAD THE WAY.
 HARI SREENIVASAN REPORTS ON WHAT
 SETS THE SCHOOL APART FOR OUR
 EDUCATION SERIES, "MAKING THE
 GRADE."
 LET'S START WITH GLYCOLYSIS.
 Sreenivasan: ON THE CAMPUS OF
 XAVIER UNIVERSITY, 18-YEAR-OLD
 CHRIS WEBB LEADS A BIOLOGY
 REVIEW THE NIGHT BEFORE A MAJOR
 TEST.
 ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW.
 Sreenivasan: WEBB IS HELPING
 FELLOW FRESHMAN WHO, LIKE HIM,
 ARE ENROLLED IN A RIGOROUS PRE-
 MEDICAL PROGRAM.
 I WANT THEM TO DO AS BEST AS
 THEY CAN.
 Sreenivasan: THE SCENE IS
 FAMILIAR ONE ON THE CAMPUS OF
 XAVIER, AN HISTORICALLY BLACK
 COLLEGE IN THE HEART OF NEW
 ORLEANS.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF AEROBIC
 RESPIRATION?
 Sreenivasan: STUDENTS QUIZ
 EACH OTHER ON MATERIAL FROM
 TOUGH SCIENCE CLASSES, THE KIND
 OF COURSES THAT OFTEN WEED OUT
 PREMEDICAL STUDENTS.
 I DON'T WANT THEM TO DO
 BETTER THAN ME, BUT WHEN THEY
 DO, THAT JUST MAKES ME REALIZE,
 OKAY, THIS COMPETITION IS REALLY
 SERIOUS.
 WHILE WE'RE HAVING FUN WITH IT,
 IT'S ALSO VERY REAL.
 Sreenivasan: WITH A STUDENT
 POPULATION OF ONLY 3,000, XAVIER
 UNIVERSITY MANAGES TO GRADUATE
 MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO GO ON
 TO BECOME MEDICAL DOCTORS THAN
 ANY OTHER UNDERGRADUATE
 INSTITUTION IN THE COUNTRY,
 INCLUDING IVY LEAGUES COLLEGES
 AND ELITE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES.
 THAT NUMBER IS EVEN MORE
 STRIKING GIVEN A DROP IN BLACK
 MALES APPLYING TO MEDICAL
 SCHOOLS.
 ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT
 FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN
 MEDICAL COLLEGES, FEWER BLACK
 MALES ARE APPLYING TO MEDICAL
 SCHOOLS NOW THAN IN 1978.
 REYNOLD VERRET IS XAVIER'S
 PRESIDENT.
 WE DO NOT COMPETE TO SAY WHO
 IS BETTER.
 IT'S ALMOST LIKE A
 RELAY RACE, THE GOAL IS TO
 FINISH TOGETHER. SO OUR STUDENTS
 ARE TRULY EMBRACING AND
 ENCOURAGING EACH OTHER TO
 ACHIEVE.
 Sreenivasan: THAT TURNS ON
 ITS HEAD TRADITIONAL PRE-MED
 PROGRAMS.
 OH, YES, IT DOES, IT DOES.
 Sreenivasan: WHICH IS LOOK TO
 THE LEFT, LOOK TO THE RIGHT.
 ONE OF YOU IS GONE, YES.
 WE WANT TO GET THROUGH BECAUSE
 THE COMPETITION IS ACTUALLY
 AFTER WE LEAVE XAVIER, NOT HERE.
 THE POINT IS TO GET OUT THERE
 TOGETHER.
 Sreenivasan: CALL IT
 COMPETITIVE COLLABORATION.
 HEAD OF STUDENT ADVISING QUO
 VADIS WEBSTER.
 AT SOME SCHOOLS YOU SAY,
 "LOOK TO YOUR LEFT, LOOK TO YOUR
 RIGHT, THIS PERSON MAY NOT BE
 HERE."
 HERE, WE SAY, "LOOK TO YOUR
 LEFT, LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT, YOU
 BETTER HELP THE PERSON NEXT TO
 YOU SO THAT WE CAN ALL MAKE IT."
 Sreenivasan: THE INTENSE
 STUDENT ADVISING STARTS EARLY.
 INCOMING FRESHMAN BEGIN CRAFTING
 MEDICAL SCHOOL APPLICATIONS EVEN
 BEFORE THEIR FIRST DAY AS AN
 UNDERGRADUATE.
 BEFORE CLASSES START, WE GO
 OVER A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE
 PROCESS OF PREPARING A
 COMPETITIVE APPLICATION TO
 MEDICAL SCHOOL.
 Sreenivasan: YOU'RE STARTING
 BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY WALK IN THE
 DOOR.
 HAVE TO.
 YU NEED SIX SEMESTERS AT LEAST,
 BECAUSE THAT'S SIX SEMESTERS
 BEFORE YOU APPLY.
 YOU NEED EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE
 SEMESTERS AND SUMMERS TO PUT
 INTO MAKING YOURSELF A
 COMPETITIVE APPLICATION.
 Sreenivasan: THE PREMED
 PROGRAM ALSO RELIES HEAVILY ON
 TUTORING BY UPPERCLASSMEN.
 BRADLEY DUNN, SAYS HE COULD NOT
 HAVE MADE IT THROUGH HIS FIRST
 SEMESTER WITHOUT THE FREE
 TUTORING CENTER.
 DUNN'S STUDENT TUTOR, CHINYERE
 JONES.
 BASICALLY WHENEVER HE HAD A
 BREAK HE WAS IN THE TUTORING
 CENTER.
 I WAS LIKE, JEEZ.
 Sreenivasan: DUNN BELIEVES
 STUDENTS HELPING STUDENTS COMES
 IN PART FROM SHARED EXPERIENCES
 ABOUT RACE.
 THEY UNDERSTAND THE PLIGHT OF
 AFRICAN AMERICANS.
 IT'S MORE RELATABLE, AND IT'S
 MORE INTIMATE, AND WE ALL KNOW
 THE PITFALLS THAT WE MAY FACE AS
 PEOPLE, AND TOGETHER, WE'RE A
 UNIT.
 AND I'M ACTUALLY TAKING PRIDE IN
 THAT BLACKNESS.
 Sreenivasan: RACE IS ALSO AN
 IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR CHRIS WEBB,
 WHO CHOSE XAVIER OVER FULL
 SCHOLARSHIPS TO OTHER
 UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING
 VANDERBILT AND TULANE.
 SEEING PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE
 ME, AND GETTING TO MED SCHOOL,
 AND THROUGH MED SCHOOL, IT
 MOTIVATES ME MORE COMPETING WITH
 PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE ME.
 Sreenivasan: ONE OF THOSE
 ROLE MODELS IS DR. RYAN JUPITER.
 JUPITER IS A RESIDENT DOCTOR IN
 THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF NEW
 ORLEANS UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
 CENTER.
 AN XAVIER ALUMNI, HE VISITS
 CAMPUS REGULARLY TO TELL
 STUDENTS HIS OWN STORY AS THE
 FIRST IN HIS FAMILY TO GO TO
 COLLEGE.
 I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I
 COULD LOOK LIKE I DO AND STILL
 BE ABLE TO BECOME WHAT I WANT TO
 BE.
 Sreenivasan: HOW IMPORTANT IS
 THAT?
 DO YOU THINK THAT YOUNG BLACK
 MEN DON'T SEE THAT ENOUGH?
 DEFINITELY.
 I DON'T THINK THEY DO AT ALL.
 IT'S ALSO A LONG JOURNEY, AND
 WHEN YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE WHO
 PUT IN THE TIME AND THE WORK AND
 SEE THE RESULTS OF IT, THEN IT
 KIND OF HELPS WITH THE LONG
 STRUGGLE THAT IT TAKES.
 Sreenivasan: WHEN WE MET DR.
 JUPITER, HE HAD HIS MONOGRAMMED
 JACKET ON, WHICH HE TOOK OFF FOR
 OUR INTERVIEW.
 BUT HE EXPLAINED HOW HE NORMALLY
 WEARS THE JACKET IN THE HOSPITAL
 BECAUSE IT IS ONE MORE VISUAL
 CUE TO PATIENTS THAT HE IS A
 PHYSICIAN, SOMETHING HE SAYS
 PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS EXPECT FROM
 A YOUNG BLACK MALE.
 HAVE YOU BEEN MISTAKEN FOR
 SOMETHING OTHER THAN A DOCTOR?
 ALL THE TIME.
 IT HAPPENS.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL,
 OR WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT
 INTENTIONAL, BUT IT'S VERY RARE
 THAT YOU CAN WALK INTO A ROOM AS
 A PATIENT, AND WHEN YOU SEE A
 BLACK, AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE
 WITH DREADS IN HIS HAIR AND, YOU
 KNOW, THAT THIS IS MY DOCTOR
 UNTIL YOU FORMALLY INTRODUCE
 YOURSELF.
 OR, YOU LOOK AT THE COMMENTS,
 "NURSE," OR "CAN YOU GET THIS
 FOR ME," OR "ARE YOU HERE TO
 CLEAN THE ROOM," SO TO SPEAK.
 THOSE THINGS HAVE ALL, HAVE ALL
 HAPPENED.
 Sreenivasan: STUDENTS AT
 XAVIER HOPE TO CHANGE THOSE
 STEREOTYPES.
 WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE
 DON'T TRULY SEE US FOR WHO WE
 ARE.
 WE USE THAT TO MOTIVATE
 OURSELVES, AND TO TRY TO SHOW
 PEOPLE WE'RE A LOT MORE THAN
 WHAT YOU TAKE US FOR.
 AS AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WE'RE
 KNOWN TO BE GREAT IN SPORTS, BUT
 WE CAN BE SO MUCH GREATER IN
 OTHER AREAS, AND I JUST FEEL
 LIKE WE NEED TO BE MORE
 REPRESENTED.
 Sreenivasan: THERE IS A
 BRIGHT SPOT FOR MINORITY TRENDS
 IN THE FIELD.
 THE NUMBER OF BLACK WOMEN
 APPLYING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL IS ON
 THE RISE.
 BLACK WOMEN HAVE SOMETHING TO
 PROVE.
 Sreenivasan: XAVIER SOPHOMORE
 RACHELS HITCHENS HAS ALREADY
 BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE
 UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER MEDICAL
 SCHOOL.
 WE'VE BEEN OBJECTIFIED FOR SO
 MANY YEARS.
 WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT WE CAN BE
 MORE THAN VIDEO DANCERS, WE CAN
 ACTUALLY USE OUR BRAIN AND I
 THINK THAT'S THE MOTIVATING
 FORCE THAT'S DEEP DOWN WITHIN SO
 MANY BLACK WOMEN LIKE MYSELF.
 Sreenivasan: AND LIKE
 HITCHENS, THE STUDENTS WE SPOKE
 TO AT THIS SMALL NEW ORLEANS
 COLLEGE HAD BIG PLANS.
 I WANT TO BE AN ORTHOPEDIC
 SURGEON.
 I WANT TO BE A PEDIATRIC
 CARDIOLOGIST.
 I WANT TO BE A RURAL FAMILY
 PRACTICE PHYSICIAN.
 Sreenivasan: PAVING THE WAY
 FOR ANOTHER GENERATION OF
 AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS.
 IN NEW ORLEANS FOR THE PBS
 NEWSHOUR, I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.
 Woodruff: FINALLY, TONIGHT, A GENEROUS JOURNALISM PRIZE WAS
 AWARDED TODAY BY THE HEISING-
 SIMONS FOUNDATION.
 THE AMERICAN MOSAIC PRIZE IS
 GIVEN TO TWO FREELANCE
 JOURNALISTS FOR LONG FORM
 REPORTING THAT HIGHLIGHTS
 UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN THE
 AMERICAN LANDSCAPE.
 THE TWO RECIPIENTS THIS YEAR ARE
 ABE STREEP AND RACHEL KAADZI
 GHANSAH, WHOSE WORK ALSO
 RECEIVED THE PULITZER PRICE LAST
 YEAR.
 GHANSAH WAS FEATURED IN OUR
 BRIEF BUT SPECTACULAR SERIES IN
 2016, AND SO WE BRING THAT TO
 YOU AGAIN, AND CONGRATULATE HER
 AND ABE STREEP FOR THIS HONOR,
 AND WITH ENCOURAGEMENT TO
 CONTINUE DOING IMPORTANT
 JOURNALISM.
 I LIKE WRITING ABOUT PEOPLE
 WHO LOOK LIKE ME AND THE PEOPLE
 I KNOW WHO DON'T HAVE GOOD
 PIECES WRITTEN ABOUT THEM,
 BECAUSE WE DESERVE IT.
 I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT JIMI HENDRIX, ELECTRIC LADY STUDIOS,
 TONI MORRISON, KENDRICK LAMAR,
 THE WATTS RIOTS, TRAYVON MARTIN,
 RACHEL JEANTEL, DAVE CHAPPELLE.
 WE DON'T ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THE
 PEOPLE WHO WE KNOW AS LEGENDS
 THE WAYS THAT THEY WERE VERY
 TRUE TO THEMSELVES.
 I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE
 MOMENTS WHEN THEY WERE
 UNCOMPROMISING AND THEY WERE
 FEARLESS, BECAUSE WHAT I HOPE IS
 THAT THAT FEARLESSNESS TELLS US
 A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE CAN BE
 FEARLESS.
 WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT
 DAVE CHAPPELLE IS, HERE IS A
 MOMENT WHERE TYPICALLY WALKING
 AWAY FROM COMEDY CENTRAL,
 WALKING AWAY FROM YOUR CAREER
 WOULD BE A BAD DECISION, AND
 ANYONE WOULD TELL YOU, DON'T DO
 THAT.
 THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF IT
 IS, IS THAT HE FELT THAT THE
 SHOW HAD STARTED TO CROSS A
 LINE, AND THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY
 BECOMING A SOURCE OF
 EMBARRASSMENT.
 AND SO WALKING AWAY FROM $50
 MILLION WAS PRETTY HEROIC AND
 PRETTY DECENT AND FULL OF
 INTEGRITY.
 WELL, YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T READ
 UNTIL I WAS 12.
 AND MAYBE I WASN'T 12, BUT I WAS
 OLDER.
 I THINK PEOPLE START READING
 WHEN THEY'RE FIVE OR SOMETHING.
 AND SO BOOKS WERE KIND OF THIS
 PHANTASMAGORICAL SPACE THAT I
 COULDN'T ENTER BECAUSE MY MOM
 COULD READ.
 MY DAD WAS AN ACADEMIC.
 EVERYONE WAS SO INTELLIGENT.
 AND I COULDN'T GO THERE.
 AND THE MOMENT I COULD, I JUST
 STARTED TO READ RAVENOUSLY.
 ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT I REMEMBER
 CHANGING EVERYONE'S LIVES WAS
 "BELOVED."
 THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE
 WHO HAD BEEN SILENCED, ENSLAVED
 PEOPLE, BECAME HUMAN.
 AND, AT THAT MOMENT, I SAID,
 THIS IS WHAT A WRITER CAN DO.
 AND, SO, FOR ME, TONI MORRISON
 DOESN'T EXIST ON A HUMAN PLANE.
 SHE ALMOST EXISTS IN THIS ODD,
 SPIRITUAL, OTHERWORLD, IN TERMS
 OF HER WORK.
 AND WHEN SHE WON THAT NOBEL
 PRIZE, WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS
 THAT A LOT OF PROMINENT
 NEWSPAPERS ASKED, DOES THIS
 WOMAN DESERVE IT?
 SO, WHEN I HAD THE MOMENT TO
 TAKE THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
 MAGAZINE COVER, I DECIDED I'M
 GOING TO TAKE THAT COVER TO LAY
 FLOWERS AT THE FEET OF THIS
 WOMAN AND SAY, NOT ONLY DID YOU
 DESERVE IT, BUT THANK YOU.
