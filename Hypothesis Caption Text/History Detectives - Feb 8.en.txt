e:  WE'RE THE HISTORY DETECTIVES,  AND WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE  SOME UNTOLD STORIES  FROM AMERICA'S PAST.
 THIS WEEK, IS THIS  A MISSING MURDER WEAPON  FROM THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY  MASSACRE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHOOT IT? Tukufu:  DID THE FATHER  OF JOHN WILKES BOOTH  THREATEN TO ASSASSINATE  A SITTING PRESIDENT? SOMEONE HAS WRITTEN ANONYMOUS.
IS IT BY JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH OR NOT? THERE'S NO QUESTION, JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WAS INSANE.

Elyse:  OUR FIRST STORY  INVESTIGATES A WEAPON  THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FIRED  IN ONE OF THE NATION'S  MOST INFAMOUS CRIMES.
 FEBRUARY 14, 1929,  ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY:  GANGSTERS TURN A DAY  OF LOVE AND REFLECTION  INTO A BLOODBATH,  EXECUTING SEVEN MEN  IN A CHICAGO GARAGE.
[ machine gun firing ]  AUTHORITIES SUSPECT THE HAND  OF POWERFUL GANGSTER AL CAPONE,  WHO WAS FIGHTING TO CONTROL THE  CITY'S ILLEGAL LIQUOR TRADE.
 THE DAYLIGHT KILLING  OUTRAGES THE NATION  AND BECOMES A SYMBOL  OF THE FAILURE OF PROHIBITION.
 HOWEVER, NO ONE IS EVER  CONVICTED OF THE KILLING  AND THE CRIME  REMAINS UNSOLVED.
 NOW MIKE LUX  OF LAKE GENEVA, WISCONSIN,  BELIEVES HE HAS  THE MISSING WEAPON  FROM THIS LEGENDARY  GANGLAND MASSACRE.
THIS GUN MAY HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF TWO MEN.
 I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET MIKE  AND LOOK INTO HIS STORY.
 VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
OH, WOW! 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
AND WHAT'S THE STORY BEHIND IT? IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY USED IN THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE.
THAT WAS IN CHICAGO IN 1929.
YES.
YOU KNOW, JUST BY LOOKING AT THE GUN, TO ME IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THE BARREL IS NOT PERIOD TO THE PIECE.
CORRECT.
I HAD THIS BARREL PUT ON TO MAKE IT LEGAL.
ORIGINALLY THE BARREL WAS CUT OFF PROBABLY ABOUT RIGHT HERE.
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE PICTURES OF IT.
OH, AND I CAN SEE THE BARREL'S MUCH SHORTER.
 MIKE TELLS ME THAT  SHORT-BARREL SHOTGUNS  ARE FEDERALLY REGULATED  AND THAT HE PUT A LONGER BARREL  ON THE GUN  TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES.
HOW'D YOU GET THE GUN? I HAD INHERITED IT FROM MY FATHER WHEN HE PASSED AWAY.
 MIKE SAYS HIS FATHER  GOT THE GUN  FROM A FORMER CHICAGO FIRE  COMMISSIONER, ROBERT QUINN.
 MIKE BELIEVES THAT QUINN,  WHO IS NOW DECEASED,  MAY HAVE USED HIS INFLUENCE  TO SECRETLY ACQUIRE THE GUN.
 I THINK WHEN QUINN ACQUIRED IT, IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN IN THE MID-'70s.
 MIKE'S FATHER WAS KILLED  IN AN AIR CRASH IN 1979.
TWO DAYS LATER, ONE OF HIS FRIENDS TALKED TO ME, AND HE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH, BUT HE WAS ALSO VERY WORRIED THAT NOW I OWN THIS PIECE AND HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE SHOWING IT OFF OR TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT IT, AND I HAVEN'T.
THAT'S WHY I'VE HAD IT FOR 30 YEARS HIDDEN AWAY.
WHAT'D YOU THINK WHEN YOUR DAD TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS USED IN THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE? I THOUGHT, COME ON, YOU'RE PULLING MY LEG.
AND HE WAS DEAD SERIOUS.
AND HE WAS A SERIOUS KIND OF GUY.
WHEN IT CAME TO WEAPONS LIKE THIS IN HIS COLLECTION, HE WAS NOT FOOLING.
MIKE, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? IF IT TRULY IS THE SHOTGUN THAT WAS USED AT THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE.
I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.
DO YOU MIND IF I SIT HERE FOR A WHILE AND EVALUATE IT? ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I USED TO WORK IN THE GUN DEPARTMENT AT CHRISTIE'S, SO I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GUNS.
AND THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DETERMINE WAS IF THIS GUN WAS EVEN AROUND IN 1929.
WAS IT PERIOD TO THE TIME OF THE MASSACRE?  IT CERTAINLY APPEARS TO BE.
 THE WOODEN FORESTOCK  IS FOR A REPEATING,  OR PUMP-ACTION,  SHOTGUN.
 THAT MEANS IT CAN FIRE  MULTIPLE SHOTS  WITHOUT RELOADING.
I KNOW THAT THERE IS A SERIAL NUMBER HERE.
AH, HERE IT IS: 18514 B.
 THAT MAY HELP US  MORE PRECISELY DATE THE GUN,  ALTHOUGH BACK THEN  I'M PRETTY CERTAIN A PURCHASER  WAS NOT REQUIRED  TO REGISTER THEIR WEAPON.
I SEE THAT IT SAYS WESTERN FIELD ON THE PLATE.
YOU KNOW, I DID NOTICE SOMETHING UNUSUAL OVER HERE ON THE STOCK.
THERE ARE TWO NOTCHES.
MAYBE WE COULD GET SOME INFORMATION FROM THAT AS WELL.
 IF THIS GUN REALLY WAS USED  IN THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY  MASSACRE,  THEN IT'S AN EXCEPTIONAL PIECE  OF HISTORY  AND ITS COLLECTION VALUE  WOULD BE VERY HIGH.
 ON THE MORNING  OF FEBRUARY 14, 1929,  SEVEN IMMACULATELY DRESSED MEN  GATHERED IN A GARAGE  ON CHICAGO'S NORTH SIDE.
 SOME WERE MEMBERS  OF A GANG  LED BY THE NOTORIOUS BOOTLEGGER  BUGS MORAN.
 WITHOUT WARNING,  GUNMEN STORMED IN  AND UNLEASHED A HAIL OF BULLETS  THAT LEFT ALL SEVEN DEAD.
 WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING  WHAT LOOKED LIKE TWO POLICE  OFFICERS LEAVE THE GARAGE.
 THE MID-MORNING SLAUGHTER  TURNED THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT  ON THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND THE  VIOLENT STRUGGLE BEING WAGED  OVER CONTROL  OF THE ILLEGAL LIQUOR TRADE.
 I'M IN CHICAGO TO MEET  THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK,  ART BILEK.
HI, ART.
HERE IS THE GUN.
TELL ME YOUR OPINION ON THAT.
WHAT DO I HAVE HERE? IT'S A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN...
 ART IS ALSO  A FORMER POLICE OFFICER  AND FAMILIAR WITH THE WEAPONS  OF CHOICE OF CRIMINALS.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT HAS A SAWED-OFF STOCK.
GANGSTERS IN THE 1920s HAD THESE STOCKS MODIFIED SO THAT THEY COULD CARRY THESE UNDER THEIR OVERCOATS LIKE THIS.
SO IT'S A GANGSTER GUN? OH, YES.
IN FACT, THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD REFER TO IT, AS A GANGSTER GUN.
 ART SAYS EXACTLY HOW  THE VICTIMS  WERE LURED TO THEIR DEATH  WAS NEVER ESTABLISHED.
 INVESTIGATORS SUSPECTED  THE PHONY POLICEMEN  WERE AL CAPONE GANG MEMBERS.
 WHEN THEY ORDERED  THE RIVAL GANGSTERS  TO LINE UP AND TURN AROUND,  MORE CAPONE MEN ENTERED,  CARRYING WEAPONS.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON EXCEPT TWO OF THE MEN PULLED OUT THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUNS AND BEGAN RIDDLING THE BACK OF THESE SEVEN MEN WITH MACHINE GUN BULLETS.
 GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE  CRIME WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
 THE CHICAGO UNDERWORLD  WAS RULED BY FEAR.
 BEFORE DYING, ONE OF  THE VICTIMS, FRANK GUSENBERG,  TOLD INCREDULOUS POLICE,  NOBODY SHOT ME.
 INVESTIGATORS TURNED  TO EVIDENCE  FROM THE BLOOD-DRENCHED GARAGE.
SERGEANT JAMES LOFTUS, WHO WAS THE FIRST OFFICER ON THE SCENE, WAS ABLE TO COLLECT FROM THE SCENE SEVERAL ITEMS.
HERE IS A COPY OF THE INVENTORY REPORT THAT HE FILED THAT VERY DAY.
 THERE WERE SEVERAL .45-CALIBER  SHELLS AND BULLETS,  THE SIZE OF AMMUNITION USED  IN THE TOMMY GUN.
 ART POINTS OUT SOMETHING  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST.
AND THERE IS THE ITEM RIGHT THERE: TWO SHOTGUN SHELLS, 12-GAUGE.
 THAT'S THE SAME GAUGE  AS MIKE'S GUN.
 I TELL ART THAT MIKE BELIEVES  HIS WEAPON ONCE BELONGED  TO ROBERT QUINN, A FORMER  CHICAGO FIRE COMMISSIONER  IN THE 1950s  THROUGH THE 1970s.
HE WAS ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE FIRE COMMISSIONERS IN THE HISTORY OF CHICAGO.
 HE SAYS QUINN WAS PART OF AN  INNER CIRCLE AROUND THE MAYOR  IN A PERIOD  WHEN CONTROL OF EVIDENCE,  ESPECIALLY FOR  A CELEBRATED COLD CASE,  WAS NOT NEARLY  AS TIGHTLY HELD AS TODAY.
DO YOU THINK THAT HE COULD HAVE OWNED THIS GUN? HE KNEW ALL OF THE TOP OFFICIALS.
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE CORONER VERY WELL.
AND HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN OTHER PEOPLE IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HE MIGHT HAVE MET A MAN THAT HAD POSSESSION OF THIS GUN.
 ART SAYS THE DESCRIPTION  OF TWO OF THE KILLERS  DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORMS  TURNED UP THE HEAT  ON INVESTIGATORS,  BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TEN MONTHS  LATER THAT THEY CAUGHT A BREAK:  AN AL CAPONE ASSOCIATE  NAMED FRED KILLER BURKE  WAS INVOLVED IN A FENDER BENDER  ACROSS STATE LINES IN MICHIGAN.
WELL, THERE WAS A POLICE OFFICER ON THE NEXT CORNER, AND HE BEGAN WALKING DOWN.
WITH THAT, KILLER BURKE DRIVES OFF, THE POLICEMAN JUMPS ON THE RUNNING BOARD, BURKE TAKES OUT HIS GUN AND SHOOTS HIM.
THE OFFICER TUMBLES TO THE GROUND DEAD.
A HUGE MANHUNT FOLLOWS, AND THAT'S HOW THEY FOUND BURKE'S CAR OVERTURNED WHERE HE TRIED TO MAKE A TURN IN THE ROAD AND FAILED.
 ART EXPLAINS THAT BURKE WAS  A CAREER GANGSTER AND HIT MAN.
 A WORLD WAR I VET, HE WAS  SUSPECTED OF INTRODUCING  THE THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUN  TO THE DETROIT MOB,  HELPING MURDER THREE MEN  IN 1927.
 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE  ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY KILLINGS,  BURKE WAS HOLED UP  IN A SMALL MICHIGAN TOWN.
 AFTER KILLING THE OFFICER,  POLICE RAIDED HIS HIDEOUT.
AND UPSTAIRS ON THE SECOND FLOOR, THEY OPENED A CLOSET AND THERE WERE THE TWO MACHINE GUNS, A SHOTGUN, AND SOME OTHER ARMORY-TYPE DEVICES.
 FORENSIC ANALYSIS  WOULD LATER CONNECT  SOME OF FRED BURKE'S WEAPONS  TO THE MASSACRE.
WHERE ARE THOSE GUNS NOW? THE GUNS AT THE CURRENT TIME ARE BEING HELD BY THE BERRIEN COUNTY, MICHIGAN, SHERIFF'S OFFICE, WHERE THEY WERE RECOVERED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 I'M IN BERRIEN COUNTY TO MEET  WITH LIEUTENANT KEITH HAFER,  THE WEAPONS EXPERT IN CHARGE  OF THE MASSACRE GUNS.
WOW.
THESE ARE THE TWO THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUNS USED IN THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE.
 LIEUTENANT HAFER EXPLAINS  THAT FOR YEARS,  THE GUNS WERE HELD  BY THE FBI  AT THEIR BALLISTICS CRIME LAB  IN QUANTICO, VIRGINIA.
 IN THE LATE 1970s, A MICHIGAN  DETECTIVE TRAINING WITH THE FBI  SPOTTED THE GUNS  AND ASKED FOR THEIR RETURN.
ARE THESE THE ONLY GUNS THAT YOU HAVE? THERE WERE OTHER GUNS SEIZED FROM FRED BURKE'S HOME, BUT THOSE GUNS ARE LONG GONE AND I HAVE NO RECORD OF THEM.
WELL, I'M INVESTIGATING THIS SHOTGUN THAT I BELIEVE MAY HAVE BEEN USED AT THE MASSACRE.
IT'S CERTAINLY THE RIGHT AGE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A GANGSTER GUN.
WHAT I NOTICE IMMEDIATELY ARE THESE TWO NOTCHES CUT INTO THE PISTOL GRIP OF THIS SHOTGUN.
 LIEUTENANT HAFER SAYS  CRIMINALS SOMETIMES CARVED  NOTCHES ON THEIR WEAPONS  WHEN THEY KILLED A MAN.
AND THE THOMPSONS THAT WE HAVE HAVE NOTCHES CARVED INTO THE TRIGGER GUARDS.
 HE'S NOT SURE  IF THE MARKINGS  CAN CONNECT OUR GUN  TO THE MASSACRE,  BUT OFFERS TO TAKE ME  TO THE FIRING RANGE  TO SHOW EXACTLY WHY OUR GUN  AND THE TOMMY GUN  WOULD HAVE BEEN FAVORITE  GANGSTER WEAPONS.
FIRE! HIT HIM RIGHT IN THE CHEST, KEEP GOING.
 THE TOMMY GUN  CAN FIRE CONTINUOUSLY.
 LIEUTENANT HAFER HAS TOLD ME TO  FIRE JUST THREE SHOTS AT A TIME  BECAUSE THE WEAPON  IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.
IT'S PRETTY POWERFUL.
 LIEUTENANT HAFER SAYS  THIS MODEL TOMMY GUN  COULD UNLOAD A DEVASTATING  700 ROUNDS A MINUTE.
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY A GANGSTER LIKES THAT GUN.
IT WAS THE HIGH-TECH WEAPON OF ITS DAY.
 HE TELLS ME THAT BEFORE THE  INTRODUCTION OF THE TOMMY GUN  TO THE CHICAGO CRIME WORLD  IN 1924,  THE REPEATING SHOTGUN WAS  THE GANGSTER GUN OF CHOICE.
 WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A PUMP-ACTION REPEATING SHOTGUN, WHICH WAS A VERY COMMON AND DEVASTATING WEAPON OF THE TIME.
 OUR GUN IS CAPABLE OF FIRING  SIX SHOTS BEFORE RELOADING,  UNLEASHING A DEVASTATING SPRAY  OF SHOTGUN PELLETS.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHOOT IT? YEAH, DEFINITELY.
PULL IT IN TIGHT, YEP.
AIM AT YOUR TARGET AND SHOOT WHEN READY.
[ gunshots and reloading ] WOW, THAT'S GOT QUITE A KICK TO IT.
WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE BOLT AND LET'S MAKE SURE IT'S EMPTY.
OKAY.
NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS GUN WAS USED IN THE ST.
VALENTINE MASSACRE? IT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.
 LIEUTENANT HAFER SUGGESTS  I PICK UP THE SHELL CASINGS.
 IF OUR GUN WAS USED  IN THE MASSACRE,  THE SHELLS MAY BEAR  USEFUL FORENSIC INFORMATION.
 HE'S NOT SURE WHAT REMAINS  IN THE OLD POLICE FILES  BUT SUGGESTS I SPEAK WITH  POLICE HISTORIAN CHRISS LYON  AT THE HERITAGE MUSEUM AND  CULTURAL CENTER IN ST.
JOSEPH.
HI, CHRISS.
HI, ELYSE.
GREAT TO MEET YOU, WELCOME TO ST.
JOSEPH, MICHIGAN.
THANK YOU.
 CHRISS SAYS THE POLICE FOUND A  TROVE OF INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE  WHEN THEY RAIDED  FRED BURKE'S HIDEOUT.
THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PHOTOS OF SOME OF THE WEAPONRY THAT WAS FOUND IN FRED BURKE'S HOUSE.
OKAY, SO I SEE HERE THE TWO TOMMY GUNS THAT WERE FOUND IN HIS HOUSE.
AND THIS IS ALL THE ARSENAL.
AND THIS MUST BE THE SHOTGUN.
 CHRISS EXPLAINS HOW THE CHICAGO  AUTHORITIES HAD TURNED  TO A FORENSICS EXPERT  NAMED CALVIN GODDARD  TO EXAMINE THE BURKE WEAPONS.
WHEN GODDARD TOOK THESE GUNS TO BE TESTED BALLISTICALLY, HE TOOK THE TOMMY GUNS AND HE TOOK THIS GUN, WHICH IS A 20-GAUGE.
NOW, WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A 12-GAUGE USED IN THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE BY THE SHELLS THAT WERE FOUND.
SO IF THIS GUN WASN'T USED IN THE MASSACRE, THEN IT'S STILL POSSIBLE THAT OUR GUN WAS.
 I'M CURIOUS, HAD GODDARD ALSO  EXAMINED THE 12-GAUGE SHELLS  FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE  AFTER THE MASSACRE?  CHRISS SUGGESTS  I SPEAK WITH  FORMER CRIME LAB DIRECTOR  PAUL DOUGHERTY,  WHO HAS STUDIED THE MASSACRE  AND THE SUBSEQUENT  POLICE DETECTIVE WORK.
OKAY, SO HERE'S THE GUN I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT.
YES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS IS A WESTERN FIELD, WHICH IS MADE BY STEVENS.
IT HAS A FAIRLY LOW SERIAL NUMBER, WHICH INDICATES IT'S FAIRLY OLD.
 PAUL SAYS THE MODEL WAS IN  PRODUCTION FROM 1905 TO 1932  AND PERIOD TO THE MASSACRE.
 HOWEVER, HE CAN'T PRECISELY  DATE THE GUN  BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER'S  SERIAL RECORDS  HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.
SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GODDARD.
WELL, CALVIN GODDARD WAS A FIRST-CLASS SCIENTIST AND HE APPROACHED EVERYTHING THAT HE DID AS A SCIENTIST.
 PAUL SAYS GODDARD TRAINED  AS A PHYSICIAN,  BUT IN 1926, ENTERED  THE EMERGING FIELD  OF BALLISTIC SCIENCE.
 HIS FORENSIC WORK,  WHICH HELPED CONVICT  ANARCHIST NICOLA SACCO  IN THE CELEBRATED SACCO  AND VANZETTI MURDER CASE,  CAUGHT THE ATTENTION  OF THE CHICAGO CORONER.
IT WAS THE ENORMITY OF THE ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE THAT BROUGHT THE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC CRIME DETECTION TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION AND TO THE ATTENTION OF AUTHORITIES OF CHICAGO.
 GODDARD TEST-FIRED  THE BURKE RAID TOMMY GUNS  AND COMPARED THE SHELLS  TO THOSE  FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
 HE EXPLAINED TO  THE CHICAGO INVESTIGATORS  HOW SPENT SHELLS HAD  THEIR OWN IDENTIFYING MARKS.
HE WOULD PUT THE CARTRIDGE CASES UNDER THE COMPARISON MICROSCOPE, ONE ON EITHER SIDE.
THEN HE COMPARED THEM THROUGH THE EYEPIECE, WHICH IS HERE.
SO, PAUL, TELL ME WHAT I'M LOOKING AT.
 USING A REPLICA  OF GODDARD'S MICROSCOPE,  PAUL TELLS ME TO COMPARE  THE IMPRESSIONS ON TWO SHELLS  FROM GODDARD'S  PERSONAL COLLECTION.
SO THE FIRING PIN IMPRESSIONS ARE THE SAME.
 BY MATCHING  FIRING PIN IMPRESSIONS,  GODDARD DETERMINED THAT  FRED BURKE'S TOMMY GUNS  WERE USED IN THE MASSACRE.
SO THESE CAME FROM THE SAME GUN.
WELL, I HAVE THESE SHELLS, AND I SHOT THESE SHELLS FROM MIKE'S GUN.
 PAUL OFFERS TO TAKE  A CLOSER LOOK.
 ALTHOUGH THE CARTRIDGE SHELLS  FROM THE CRIME SCENE  ARE LONG GONE, HE SAYS  GODDARD DID EXAMINE THEM  AND TESTIFIED IN FRONT  OF THE CORONER'S GRAND JURY.
THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT GODDARD EMPHASIZED IN HIS TESTIMONY, THOUGH, WERE THE EXTRACTOR AND EJECTOR MARKS.
EXTRACTOR MARKS ARE THE MARKINGS THAT OCCUR WHEN A SHELL IS IN THE CHAMBER OF A GUN AND IS EXTRACTED FROM THE CHAMBER, AND AN EJECTOR MARKING OCCURS WHEN THE SHELL IS KICKED OUT OF THE GUN.
 WE TAKE A CLOSE LOOK  AT OUR SHELLS.
OH, THOSE TWO LITTLE SCRATCHES? THAT IS CORRECT.
I SEE THEM.
 WHAT PAUL TELLS ME NEXT  IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE  OF INTEREST TO MIKE.
INVESTIGATORS FOUND BULLETS AND SHELLS AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, AND TWO OF THOSE SHELLS WERE FROM A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN, THE SAME GAUGE AS YOUR SHOTGUN.
THAT GETS US VERY CLOSE.
 I TELL MIKE THAT THE STRANGE  CARVED NOTCHES ON HIS WEAPON  COULD HAVE BEEN  A GANGSTER SIGNATURE,  INDICATING THE WEAPON  HAD BEEN USED IN A MURDER.
 SIMILAR MARKINGS  HAD ALSO BEEN SEEN  ON THE THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUNS  USED IN THE MASSACRE.
 ALTHOUGH MISSING EVIDENCE  MADE A DIRECT COMPARISON  WITH HIS SHELLS  IMPOSSIBLE TODAY,  AT THE TIME OF THE MASSACRE,  THE EXPERT BROUGHT IN  BY THE AUTHORITIES  HAD CONDUCTED A THOROUGH  FORENSIC INVESTIGATION.
GODDARD DID CLOSELY EXAMINE THE SHELLS THAT WERE FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, AND HE MADE A PRETTY INTERESTING DISCOVERY.
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF MARKINGS THAT GODDARD FOUND ON THE SHELLS FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
 GODDARD HAD DETERMINED  THAT THE SHOTGUN USED  IN THE MURDER OF SEVEN MEN  ON ST.
VALENTINE'S DAY, 1929,  WAS A PUMP-ACTION GUN, TOO,  THE SAME AS MIKE'S.
SO IN YOUR OPINION, COULD THIS GUN HAVE BEEN USED IN THE MASSACRE? YES.
IT IS THE RIGHT VINTAGE.
IT HAS BOTH THE EXTRACTOR AND EJECTOR MARKINGS WHICH GODDARD IDENTIFIED.
WE CAN PROVE THAT THE GUN THAT WAS SHOT THAT DAY WAS A 12-GAUGE REPEATING SHOTGUN.
YOUR GUN IS A 12-GAUGE REPEATING SHOTGUN.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
THAT'S GREAT.
 I TELL MIKE THERE ARE  NO SURVIVING POLICE RECORDS  OF ANY OTHER SHOTGUN  BEING RECOVERED BY POLICE  AND TIED TO THE KILLINGS.
WHILE WE CAN'T CONCLUSIVELY LINK YOUR GUN TO THE MASSACRE, NO EVIDENCE RULES IT OUT.
VERY INTERESTING.
SO IF THE ORIGINAL SHELLS SURFACE, THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FINISH GODDARD'S WORK AND DETERMINE IF YOUR GUN FIRED THEM.
HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER WOULD FEEL, THE FACT THAT WE'VE COME THIS FAR? HE WOULD BE ECSTATIC.
HE WOULD SAY, I TOLD YOU SO.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 FRED BURKE WAS NEVER CONVICTED  FOR THE MASSACRE.
 INSTEAD, HE WAS PUT AWAY  FOR KILLING POLICE OFFICER  CHARLES SKELLY.
 CAPONE WAS EVENTUALLY BROUGHT  DOWN ON CHARGES OF TAX EVASION.
 BUT GODDARD'S WORK  BROUGHT CREDIBILITY  TO THE YOUNG FIELD  OF BALLISTICS.
 HE WAS GIVEN RESOURCES  TO OPEN  ONE OF THE NATION'S FIRST  INDEPENDENT CRIME LABS  AND CONTINUED TO PIONEER  TECHNIQUES  THAT ARE STILL USED TODAY.
FOR MORE OF MY INTERVIEW WITH ART BELIK, VISIT HISTORY DETECTIVES ON THE WEB AT pbs.org.
THE GUN THAT MADE THE '20s ROAR WAS INSPIRED BY WORLD WAR I TRENCH WARFARE.
THE THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUN WAS DESIGNED BY RETIRED GENERAL JOHN THOMPSON.
EARLY MACHINE GUNS WERE EXTREMELY HEAVY AND TOOK SEVERAL MEN TO OPERATE.
THOMPSON'S SOLUTION WAS A RAPID-FIRING WEAPON OPERATED BY A SINGLE SOLDIER.
THE TRENCH BROOM WAS DESIGNED TO SWEEP THE ENEMY OUT OF FOXHOLES.
BUT THE GUN WASN'T READY UNTIL AFTER THE WAR ENDED, SO THE GENERAL TRIED SELLING IT TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
ONE NOTORIOUS AD FEATURED A COWBOY DEFENDING HIS RANCH FROM BANDITS.
DEEMED SIMPLE, SAFE, STURDY, AND SURE IN ACTION, AN ORIGINAL TOMMY COULD FIRE 1,500 ROUNDS PER MINUTE.
GANGSTERS SAW THE POTENTIAL.
THE GUN WAS SUCH A FAVORITE OF THE CHICAGO MOB THAT IT WAS ALSO KNOWN AS THE CHICAGO TYPEWRITER, THE CHICAGO PIANO, AND THE CHICAGO ORGAN GRINDER.
FOR CONCEALMENT, THE COMPACT GUN COULD BE TOTED AROUND IN A REFITTED MUSICAL INSTRUMENT CASE.
THE THOMPSON DID MAKE IT TO THE BATTLEFIELD IN WORLD WAR II.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WERE ORDERED AT A COST OF NEARLY $130 MILLION TOTAL.
BY THE END OF THE WAR, LIGHTER AND CHEAPER COMPETITORS ENDED THE TOMMY'S REIGN.
Tukufu:  OUR NEXT STORY INVESTIGATES  A DEATH THREAT SENT  TO ONE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENTS  OF THE UNITED STATES.
 ON APRIL 14, 1865,  A MAN STANDING  IN THE SHADOWS  OF PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S  THEATER BOX  FIRED ONE FINAL SHOT.
 IT WAS THE FIRST ASSASSINATION  OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT,  AND JOHN WILKES BOOTH'S MOTIVES  HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED  AND STUDIED FOR GENERATIONS.
 NOW, ALMOST 150 YEARS LATER,   MARSHA MULLIN  OF NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE,  HAS LEARNED OF A LETTER  SUPPOSEDLY WRITTEN  BY JOHN WILKES BOOTH'S FATHER  TO ANOTHER AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
TODAY SOMEBODY WOULD BE TAKEN OFF TO JAIL IN FIVE MINUTES FOR WRITING A LETTER LIKE THAT.
 MARSHA HAS INVITED ME  TO THE HERMITAGE,  PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON'S  FAMILY HOME IN NASHVILLE,  WHERE SHE IS CHIEF CURATOR.
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME? WELL, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, A VISITOR BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THIS LETTER, WHICH WAS A DEATH THREAT TO ANDREW JACKSON WRITTEN IN 1835.
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, SO I GOT A COPY OF IT FROM THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
 THE SIGNATURE ON  THE DEATH THREAT READS  JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WAS A VERY FAMOUS ACTOR, BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, HE WAS ALSO THE FATHER OF JOHN WILKES BOOTH.
NOW, THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONNECTION.
IT'S VERY INTERESTING.
 IT'S DATED  THE 4th OF JULY, 1835,  FROM BROWER'S HOTEL,  PHILADELPHIA.
YOU DAMNED OLD SCOUNDREL, I WILL CUT YOUR THROAT WHILST YOU ARE SLEEPING.
 HE'S INSISTING THAT JACKSON  PARDON TWO MEN ON DEATH ROW.
I'LL HAVE YOU BURNT AT THE STAKE IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON.
YOUR MASTER, JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.
MAN, NOW THIS IS A THREAT.
SO THE FATHER OF THE GUY WHO KILLED LINCOLN THREATENED TO ASSASSINATE A PRESIDENT.
WELL, THAT'S THE QUESTION.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BACK OF THE LETTER, SOMEONE HAS WRITTEN ANONYMOUS.
AND SO THAT WAS VERY CURIOUS.
IS IT BY JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH OR NOT? JACKSON SCHOLARS SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE.
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW IF JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH REALLY WROTE THIS LETTER, AND IF HE DID, WHY? WELL, LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.
 THE SINS OF A FATHER  ARE NOT NECESSARILY VISITED  UPON THE SON.
 BUT PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S MURDER  ALTERED AMERICAN HISTORY.
 IF JOHN WILKES BOOTH'S FATHER  ALSO THREATENED THE LIFE  OF A SITTING PRESIDENT,  THAT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING  AND POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT.
 JACKSON WAS THE 7th PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES  AND FIRST TOOK OFFICE  IN 1829.
 JUNIUS BOOTH WAS THE POPULAR  SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR OF THE DAY.
 THE QUESTION IS,  WHY HAVE HISTORIANS DOUBTED  THAT JUNIUS BOOTH WROTE THIS  IN THE FIRST PLACE?  MARSHA'S LEFT ME  20th-CENTURY PUBLICATIONS  OF A JACKSON BIOGRAPHY  AND A COLLECTION  OF HIS CORRESPONDENCE.
 BOTH VOLUMES INCLUDE MENTION  OF OUR LETTER.
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH HERE IS IN QUOTATION MARKS.
BOOTH, IN QUOTATION MARKS, TO ANDREW JACKSON, JULY 4, 1835.
 THE QUOTATION MARKS INDICATE  THE AUTHORS AND EDITORS  ALSO DOUBTED THAT BOOTH WROTE  THE DEATH THREAT.
I NEED TO FOUND OUT IF THESE DOUBTS ARE BASED ON SOME ACTUAL EVIDENCE.
 THE LETTER WRITER,  WHOEVER HE WAS,  WANTED TWO MEN PARDONED:  DE RUIZ AND DE SOTO.
 I WONDER WHAT OTHER CLUES  THERE MIGHT BE.
IT SAYS DOWN HERE IN A POSTSCRIPT, YOU KNOW ME, LOOK OUT.
DOES IT MEAN THAT HE KNEW HIM PERSONALLY? DOES IT MEAN THAT HE KNEW OF HIM? I WROTE TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS.
DID HE WRITE MORE THREATS TO THE PRESIDENT?  THE PAPERS OF ANDREW JACKSON  PROJECT  AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE  IN KNOXVILLE  IS IN THE PROCESS OF PUBLISHING  AN UPDATED VERSION  OF EVERY KNOWN DOCUMENT  THAT JACKSON WROTE OR RECEIVED.
 DAN FELLER IS THE DIRECTOR  AND EDITOR OF THE PROJECT.
LET'S GO INTO THE JACKSON PAPERS.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS LETTER BEFORE? OH, YES, WE KNOW IT WELL.
WE DON'T THINK THAT THE REAL JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WROTE IT.
OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE ORIGINAL NOTATION WAS CORRECT, THAT IT'S ANONYMOUS.
 DAN EXPLAINS THAT  PRESIDENT JACKSON'S STRONG-HAND  AND OFTEN UNPOPULAR POLICIES  HAD MADE HIM A LIGHTNING ROD  FOR CRITICISM AND THREATS.
 SIX MONTHS BEFORE  OUR LETTER WAS WRITTEN,  HE WAS THE VICTIM OF  THE FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT  AGAINST AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
 A DERANGED HOUSE PAINTER  ATTEMPTED TO SHOOT HIM  OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL BUILDING,  BUT THE PISTOL MISFIRED.
SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THE WASHINGTON GLOBE PUBLISHED SEVERAL COLUMNS OF ASSASSINATION LETTERS THAT IT SAID JACKSON HAD RECEIVED.
LET ME PUT THESE UP ON OUR COMPUTER SCREEN SO YOU CAN READ THEM BETTER.
HERE'S ONE.
DAMN YOUR OLD SOUL, IF YOU DO NOT DO SOMETHING FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, I WILL MURDER YOU.
WOW.
 DAN SAYS JACKSON  DREW PUBLIC CRITICISM  BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO AWAY  WITH THE FEDERALLY CHARTERED  BANK OF THE UNITED STATES,  WHICH HE REGARDED AS AN  UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONCENTRATION  OF FINANCIAL POWER.
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE: REMOVE THEM DEPOSITS BACK AGAIN AND RECHARTER THE BANK, OR YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE SHOT IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS, AND THAT BY MYSELF! THE UNITED STATES SENATE ACTUALLY CENSURED JACKSON FOR REMOVING THE DEPOSITS, THE ONLY TIME A PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN CENSURED BY THE SENATE.
 DAN SAYS T RUIZ AND DE SOTO  MENTIONED IN OUR LETTER  WERE SPANISH PIRATES OPERATING  OUT OF HAVANA.
 WITH TEN OTHERS,  THEY HAD ROBBED  AN AMERICAN MERCHANT SHIP  IN SEPTEMBER 1832.
 THE PIRATES' CAPTURE  AND SUBSEQUENT TRIAL  ELECTRIFIED THE NATION.
THIS WAS A HUGE CASE.
IT HAD ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF A MODERN SHOW TRIAL.
 ONE OF THE SPANIARDS,  DE SOTO,  WAS PARDONED MOST LIKELY  BECAUSE HE PREVIOUSLY HAD SAVED  THE LIVES OF SOME  AMERICAN SAILORS.
 DAN SAYS THE PARDON  WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT  AS A RESULT  OF THE DEATH THREAT.
HOW SERIOUSLY WAS THIS THREAT TAKEN?  DAN DOUBTS THERE WAS  ANY OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION  INTO THE LETTER.
 THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  DID NOT HAVE  THE PROTECTIVE LAYERS  IT HAS TODAY.
THERE WAS NO SECRET SERVICE, THERE WAS NO FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, THERE WERE REALLY NO WHITE HOUSE POLICE.
IN FACT, ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT OR THREATENING TO DO SO WAS NOT A FEDERAL CRIME.
HERE HE SAYS, I WROTE TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS.
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN BOOTH AND JACKSON? IF THERE WERE ANY, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM.
WE KNOW OF ONE LETTER FROM SOMEONE CALLING HIMSELF JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH TO JACKSON, AND THIS IS IT.
AND THAT'S IT.
AND NOT ONLY NO LETTERS FROM BOOTH OR TO BOOTH, BUT NO MENTION OF BOOTH IN JACKSON'S CORRESPONDENCE.
 WHOEVER WANTED  THESE PIRATES PARDONED,  DAN'S CONVINCED  IT WASN'T BOOTH.
EVERY HISTORIAN PREVIOUS TO US, EVERY JACKSON BIOGRAPHER, HAS ASSUMED THAT BOOTH DIDN'T WRITE IT.
SOMEONE IN HIS OFFICE -
AND HE HAD A NUMBER OF CLERKS WORKING FOR HIM -
PROBABLY WROTE THIS WORD ANONYMOUS.
JACKSON DID NOT WRITE IT.
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE JACKSON'S HANDWRITING, NO.
HAS THERE BEEN AN ANALYSIS OF THE HANDWRITING IN THIS LETTER? AS FAR AS I KNOW, NO ONE HAS EVER TAKEN IT TO THAT STEP BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS UNNECESSARY.
 THAT SEEMS A CURIOUS OMISSION.
 THE FOLGER SHAKESPEARE LIBRARY  IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,  HAS SEVERAL JUNIUS BOOTH  LETTERS IN THEIR COLLECTION.
 HEATHER WOLFE IS CURATOR  OF MANUSCRIPTS.
 SHE'S MADE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS  WITH THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS  TO OBTAIN THE ORIGINAL THREAT  TO JACKSON.
HEATHER, NICE TO MEET YOU.
SO THIS IS THE ORIGINAL LETTER.
I PICKED TWO OF OUR JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH LETTERS FOR A HANDWRITING ANALYSIS.
I PICKED THESE TWO LETTERS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSEST IN DATE AND FORMAT TO THE 1835 LETTER TO GENERAL JACKSON.
 IT'S THE FIRST TIME  HEATHER HAS SEEN  THE ORIGINAL LETTER  TO JACKSON,  AND A COUPLE OF ITEMS  STRIKE HER AS ODD.
HE SIGNS THE LETTER TO JACKSON WITH HIS FULL NAME, JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.
ALL OF THE LETTERS AT THE FOLGER ARE SIGNED J.B.
BOOTH, AND THAT WAS HIS TYPICAL SIGNATURE.
 THE REST OF THE LETTER  LOOKS AS IF  IT COULD'VE FLOWED  FROM THE SAME PEN.
AND YOU SEE HERE, I WROTE TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS, AND SEE THE BOTTOM OF THAT C, HOW IT LOOPS AROUND DRAMATICALLY? WELL, IN THIS LETTER HERE, WE SEE THE WORD CAMP WITH THAT SAME VERY DISTINCTIVE MAJUSCULE C, WHICH IS VERY UNIQUE TO JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.
ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE ATTRIBUTES HE HAS IS THE CROSSBAR ON THE MINISCULE T's.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORD THE IN THIS LETTER, THE CROSSBAR GOES FULLY ACROSS NOT JUST THE T BUT ALSO THE H AND THE E.
 IF BOOTH DIDN'T WRITE THIS  HIMSELF,  SHE SAYS THE FORGER WAS  AT THE TOP OF HIS CLASS.
 HEATHER'S MADE  ANOTHER DISCOVERY.
THIS LETTER FROM 1834 MENTIONS THAT HE NEEDED TO ESCAPE THE FARM FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND GO TO PHILADELPHIA, AND IT SAYS, THEREFORE I STROLLED TO PHILADELPHIA.
BROWER'S HOTEL IS NOW ABOUT THE BEST IN THAT CITY.
SO HE HAS A HISTORY OF FREQUENTING THE BROWER'S HOTEL IN PHILADELPHIA.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? DID JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WRITE THIS LETTER? BASED ON HANDWRITING ANALYSIS ALONE, YES, IT IS A JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH LETTER.
BUT I'M NOT A BOOTH EXPERT, SO I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR BOOTH SCHOLARS.
WE'D NEED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THE LETTER.
 WHY DID A FAMOUS  SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR  CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THE FATE  OF TWO SPANISH PIRATES  TO HAVE PENNED  A DEATH THREAT  TO THE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES?  GENE SMITH HAS AGREED  TO MEET ME  AT THE FOLGER LIBRARY'S  ELIZABETHAN THEATER.
 HE'S THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK  ON THE BOOTH FAMILY'S INFLUENCE  ON AMERICAN THEATER.
IN ADDITION TO BEING A GREAT ACTOR, JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WAS A GREAT MADMAN ALL HIS LIFE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION HE WAS INSANE.
 GENE SAYS THAT THE WILD  AND ERRATIC BEHAVIOR ONSTAGE  LED BOOTH TO BE DUBBED  THE MAD TRAGEDIAN.
HIS BOUTS OF LUNACY COULD INTERRUPT A PRODUCTION.
HE WOULD RUN AWAY FROM THE THEATER AND BE FOUND WALKING NAKED DOWN THE STREET.
 BOOTH'S EXCESSIVE DRINKING  EXACERBATED HIS MADNESS.
THEATER MANAGERS WOULD LOCK HIM UP TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTING DRUNK.
FREQUENTLY, HE WOULD ESCAPE AND SIMPLY VANISH FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS.
DID HIS FITS OF MADNESS LEAD HIM TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE? YES, BUT ONLY VERY OCCASIONALLY.
HE WAS CAPABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PERFORMANCE OF BECOMING SO INVOLVED IN KILLING DESDEMONA AS OTHELLO THAT WHEN THE MOMENT CAME TO PRESS THE PILLOW AGAINST DESDEMONA'S FACE, PEOPLE WERE AFRAID HE WOULD ACTUALLY MURDER THE ACTRESS.
WELL, THIS LETTER IS A THREAT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON.
COULD THAT VIOLENT BEHAVIOR HAVE EXTENDED TO MURDER? IT IS POSSIBLE.
HOWEVER, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH HAD A REVERENCE FOR LIFE THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.
GENERALLY, HE HURT NOBODY BUT HIMSELF: HIS KIDS WERE FORBIDDEN TO SWAT A FLY, HE WOULD NOT CUT DOWN A TREE.
 HIS DEATH THREAT,  IF BOOTH PENNED IT,  MAY HAVE BEEN A BOUT  OF ALCOHOLIC MADNESS,  HIS REVERENCE FOR LIFE  BIZARRELY PROVOKING HIM  TO THREATEN MURDER.
MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT MR.
BOOTH PROBABLY READ THAT JACKSON WAS CONSIDERING THE EXECUTION OF THESE TWO MEN AND, IN ONE OF HIS FRENZIES, THREATENED TO KILL HIM.
 HE DOUBTS PRESIDENT JACKSON  TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.
INDEED, THE LETTER SAYS, YOU KNOW ME, AND HE DID KNOW HIM.
JACKSON AND BOOTH WERE CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDS.
I THINK JACKSON WOULD'VE PROBABLY SAID, WELL, THAT'S BOOTH FOR YOU, AND JACKSON WOULD'VE LAUGHED IT OFF.
 GENE PAINTS A PICTURE  OF A TURBULENT  AND DEEPLY TROUBLED MAN  FREQUENTLY ABSENT  FROM HIS FAMILY.
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WAS AWAY ON THE ROAD, TROUPING AROUND AS AN ACTOR FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR.
 BUT GENE IS RELUCTANT  TO MAKE ANY CONNECTION  BETWEEN THE DEATH THREAT  JUNIUS BOOTH MAY HAVE MADE  TO PRESIDENT JACKSON  AND HIS SON'S MURDER OF  ABRAHAM LINCOLN 30 YEARS LATER.
I THINK IT'S EXCEEDINGLY IMPROBABLE.
HIS KILLING OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS SO ALIEN TO HIS FATHER'S REVERENCE FOR LIFE THAT THERE CANNOBE ANY TRACEABLE PATH.
 I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE  OF ALL OF THIS,  AND I STILL DON'T HAVE  ANY SOLID EVIDENCE  TO SUPPORT  THE HANDWRITING ANALYSIS.
[ cell phone rings ] HEY, DAN, HOW YOU DOING?  IT'S DAN FELLER.
 SEEMS OUR MEETING  PROMPTED HIM  TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL RESEARCH.
 I TELL DAN ABOUT  THE HANDWRITING COMPARISON  AND WHAT ELSE I'VE LEARNED  ABOUT JUNIUS BOOTH.
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME THAT JACKSON AND BOOTH WERE ACTUALLY FRIENDS AND THAT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN JEST.
I DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH.
WE HAVE HERE ALL OF ANDREW JACKSON'S LETTERS THAT ANYONE KNOWS ABOUT; WE KNOW OF NO EVIDENCE TO PUT JACKSON AND BOOTH TOGETHER IN ANY WAY.
 HIS TEAM HAS UNCOVERED SEVERAL  NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION.
 OUR LETTER'S DATED JULY 4th.
 HE'S BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT  BOOTH'S WHEREABOUTS THAT DAY.
THESE ARE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS SHOWING THAT BOOTH WAS INDEED IN PHILADELPHIA ON JULY 3rd AND 4th.
HE WAS SCHEDULED TO PLAY OTHELLO ON THE 3rd AT THE CHESTNUT STREET THEATRE...
I SEE.
AND SCHEDULED TO PLAY RICHARD III ON THE 4th.
 THAT PUTS BOOTH  IN PHILADELPHIA  AT THE TIME THE LETTER  WAS WRITTEN.
AND HERE'S THE REAL CLINCHER.
THIS IS ANOTHER LETTER THAT BOOTH WROTE IN AUGUST OF 1835.
HE APOLOGIZES FOR THE UNGRATEFUL AND SHAMEFUL CONDUCT I HAVE EVINCED TOWARD THE WORTHY MANAGERS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET THEATRE ON A RECENT OCCASION, FRIDAY, JULY 3rd, AND SATURDAY THE 4th.
IN FACT, HE DID NOT PLAY ON JULY 3rd AND 4th; HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.
SO HE WAS THERE, AND MAYBE IN ONE OF HIS FITS OF MADNESS, DID NOT PERFORM.
EXACTLY.
 BUT AS FOR THREATENING  TO ASSASSINATE THE PRESIDENT,  I STILL DON'T HAVE  A SMOKING GUN.
BUT LOOK FURTHER DOWN IN THE LETTER.
 THERE AT THE END,  JUNIUS BOOTH HIMSELF GIVES ME  MY FINAL PIECE  OF THE PUZZLE.
MY INSANE BEHAVIOR...
 I THINK I FINALLY HAVE  AN ANSWER FOR MARSHA.
VERY INTERESTING INVESTIGATION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO THE LIFE OF JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.
 I TELL MARSHA  THAT THE HANDWRITING  OF THIS ASSASSINATION THREAT  MATCHED OTHER LETTERS  PENNED BY BOOTH.
THAT'S COOL; I AM REALLY PLEASED.
 BUT WHAT TIED  THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE  TOGETHER WAS AN OPEN LETTER  FROM BOOTH  THAT SEEMED TO BE  AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.
HE SAYS, MY INSANE BEHAVIOR IN WRITING INSOLENT LETTERS TO MY BEST PATRONS AND TO THE AUTHORITIES OF THIS COUNTRY I CAN SCARCELY HOPE WILL BE PARDONED.
THE AUTHORITIES OF THIS COUNTRY.
YOU THINK HE'S REFERRING TO PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON HERE? I'LL BET HE IS, BECAUSE ONE SENTENCE FURTHER DOWN, HE SAYS, MAY GOD PRESERVE GENERAL JACKSON AND THIS HAPPY REPUBLIC.
 DAN SAYS  OUR HANDWRITING ANALYSIS  AND HIS QUESTIONING  OF CONVENTIONAL WISDOM  HAVE CORRECTED  THE HISTORICAL RECORD.
 PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S KILLER,  JOHN WILKES BOOTH,  WAS FATHERED BY A MAN  WHO ALSO THREATENED  TO MURDER A SITTING PRESIDENT.
WE HAD ASSUMED, AS THOSE BEFORE US HAD ASSUMED, THAT THE REAL BOOTH DIDN'T WRITE THIS LETTER ON THE BASIS OF THAT ONE WORD, ANONYMOUS.
IT TURNED OUT HE DID.
IT REMINDS US ALWAYS TO CHECK OUR FACTS, ALWAYS TO GO BACK AND VERIFY, EVEN WHEN WE THINK WE KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
THAT IS AMAZING.
I'M SHOCKED.
I MEAN, IT'S AN INTERESTING COINCIDENCE THAT HE WROTE SUCH A LETTER AND THAT HIS SON ENDED UP ASSASSINATING LINCOLN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THIS STORY.
THANK YOU.
WHOSE JOB IS IT TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT? WELL, BEFORE THE SECRET SERVICE, IT WAS SOMETIMES THE ARMY, SOMETIMES THE LOCAL POLICE.
BUT LOTS OF TIMES, IT WAS NO ONE.
JEFFERSON WALKED TO HIS OWN INAUGURATION UNGUARDED.
MARTIN VAN BUREN WALKED TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS ALONE.
ON THE NIGHT LINCOLN WAS ASSASSINATED, A LOCAL WASHINGTON PATROLMAN HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE ABANDONED HIS POST TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE PLAY.
THE SECRET SERVICE WAS CREATED FOUR MONTHS AFTER LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION NOT TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT BUT TO PROTECT THE ECONOMY.
ITS AGENTS WERE CHARGED WITH FIGHTING COUNTERFEITING.
TWO MORE PRESIDENTS WOULD BE ASSASSINATED BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION BECAME A FULL-TIME NATIONAL PRIORITY.
ONE GUNMAN KILLED PRESIDENT GARFIELD AT A WASHINGTON TRAIN STATION IN 1881 AND ANOTHER GUNMAN SHOT PRESIDENT McKINLEY AT THE PAN-AM EXPO IN BUFFALO IN 1901.
AFTER THREE ASSASSINATIONS IN LESS THAN 40 YEARS, CONGRESS FINALLY ASSIGNED THE SECRET SERVICE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT AT ALL TIMES.
Wes:  OUR LAST STORY EXPLORES  A BLACK MARKET TRADE  THAT SCANDALIZED  POST-CIVIL-WAR OHIO.
 SINCE BEFORE THE TIME  OF THE PHARAOHS,  CIVILIZATIONS HAVE BEEN  BURYING THEIR DEAD  ALONG WITH PERSONAL EFFECTS,  JEWELRY AND ARTIFACTS  THAT COULD  MAKE A THIEF RICH  OVERNIGHT.
 BUT LEFT UNGUARDED,  THESE COFFINS AND TOMBS  FREQUENTLY BECAME THE TREASURE  CHESTS OF GRAVE ROBBERS.
 OVER THE CENTURIES,  COUNTLESS SITES  HAVE BEEN DESECRATED,  LOOTED,  AND VALUABLE HISTORIC ARTIFACTS  LOST TO THE BLACK MARKET.
 HENRY DORRUM  OF CHESANING, MICHIGAN,  BELIEVES HE'S FOUND  THE 19th-CENTURY ANSWER  TO THIS HISTORIC PROBLEM.
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING FOR ABOUT 25 YEARS, AND THIS IS THE MOST UNUSUAL OBJECT I'VE EVER FOUND.
 I WANT TO GET A LOOK  AT WHAT KIND OF STRANGE GADGET  HENRY BOUGHT FOR HIMSELF.
WELL, WHAT'S IN THE BOX? I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.
IT'S A HEAVY LITTLE DEVIL.
OH, THAT IS HEAVY.
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS THING? AT A FARM AUCTION IN SAGINAW COUNTY, MICHIGAN.
I LIKE UNUSUAL ITEMS OF ALL KINDS.
I'M A COLLECTOR OF ANYTHING.
I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU, ARE YOU SURE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO EXPLODE? OH, NO, IT'S BEEN THOROUGHLY CHECKED.
I'VE HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME, AND YOU CAN LOOK DOWN IN THERE, AND IT'S COMPLETELY VOID OF ANY POWDER.
 HENRY EXPLAINS THAT ONCE  WHEN HE HAD IT ON DISPLAY  AT A BALTIMORE GUN SHOW,  A PASSERBY CLAIMED  HE RECOGNIZED THE DEVICE.
 HE TOLD HENRY IT WAS  A KIND OF GRAVE ALARM.
I'D SEEN A PICTURE OF IT IN A MAGAZINE YEARS AGO, AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, A GRAVE ALARM.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.
 THE STRANGER TOLD HIM  GRAVE ALARMS WERE USED  TO PROTECT JEWELRY  AND OTHER VALUABLES  THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BURIED  WITH THE DECEASED.
THEY WOULD PUT ONE OF THESE IN THE CASKET, AND WHEN THE GRAVE ROBBER OPENS THE COFFIN, IT'S GOING TO BLOW UP IN HIS FACE.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS? I WANT YOU GUYS TO FIND OUT IF THIS TRULY IS A GRAVE ALARM.
WELL, HENRY, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DIG UP.
 I CAN'T FIND ANY MAKER'S MARK  OR SERIAL NUMBER,  WHICH IS A LITTLE ODD IF THIS  HAD BEEN MANUFACTURED FOR SALE.
 I'M SKEPTICAL THIS IS AN ALARM,  AS HENRY BELIEVES.
 IT LOOKS MORE LIKE SOME  KIND OF CIVIL-WAR-ERA WEAPON.
THIS IS A BOMB.
I MEAN, THIS THING WOULD'VE HELD MAYBE HALF A POUND, THREE-QUARTERS OF A POUND OF BLACK POWDER IN HERE.
 IT WEIGHS ABOUT EIGHT POUNDS  AND IT'S MADE OF CAST IRON,  WHICH WOULD'VE TURNED INTO  SHARDS OF DEADLY SHRAPNEL  IF THIS THING  HAD EVER EXPLODED.
THIS IS A SPRING-LOADED HAMMER THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SET BY MOVING THIS METAL BAR ON THE COLLAR AROUND.
 IF SOMEBODY STEPPED ON IT,  THIS FIRING MECHANISM  WOULD'VE ALMOST CERTAINLY  HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED.
SO WHEN THIS LITTLE COLLAR IS MOVED EVEN A FRACTION OF AN INCH, THE HAMMER DROPS, AND THEN IT HITS AN EXPLOSIVE CAP, ALMOST LIKE A CAP GUN.
AND IF YOU LOOK, YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S A HOLE ON THAT NIPPLE, SO A SPARK WOULD TRAVEL INTO THAT INTERIOR, IGNITE THE GUNPOWDER, AND BAM!  I'VE COME OUT  TO THE CORDOVA DRAGWAY PARK,  ABOUT TWO HOURS WEST  OF CHICAGO,  TO SEE JUST HOW DANGEROUS OUR  EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WOULD'VE BEEN.
 LARRY LEFFERTS  OF CENTRAL STATES FIREWORKS  CONFIRMED THE AMOUNT  OF BLACK POWDER  OUR DEVICE WOULD'VE CARRIED.
WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK THREE-QUARTERS OF A POUND OF BLACK POWDER AND WE BURIED THEM AND PUT A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT ON TOP TO SIMULATE WHAT IT MAY LOOK LIKE.
FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! Wes: WHOA, THAT THING COULD DO SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE!  ABOUT AN HOUR FROM THE DRAGWAY  IS T ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL.
 ESTABLISHED IN 1862,  IT'S THE NATION'S LARGEST  GOVERNMENT-OWNED  AND OPERATED ARSENAL.
 KRIS LEINICKE IS  THE CURATOR OF THE MUSEUM,  WHICH HOUSES  AN EXTENSIVE COLLECTION  OF HISTORIC MILITARY WEAPONS.
THIS IS THE DEVICE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU.
OKAY.
WOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE? IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT MIGHT BE A CIVIL-WAR TORPEDO.
TORPEDO?  KRIS EXPLAINS THAT TODAY,  TORPEDO IS KNOWN  AS AN UNDERWATER WEAPON  LAUNCHED FROM A SUBMARINE  OR WARSHIP,  BUT IT ONCE HAD  A MUCH BROADER DEFINITION.
BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR, A TORPEDO MEANT ANY HIDDEN EXPLOSIVE OR LAND MINE.
 KRIS SAYS THAT PERCUSSION CAPS,  WHICH FIT OVER THE NIPPLES  AND PRODUCE THE SPARKS  THAT IGNITED THE GUNPOWDER,  WERE A CIVIL-WAR TECHNOLOGY.
SO IS THIS A MILITARY DEVICE, THEN? I DON'T THINK IT IS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT MARKED, AND A LOT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AT THAT TIME DID HAVE MARKINGS.
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE COLLAR ON THE NIPPLE IS DIFFERENT THAN ON MILITARY WEAPONS OF THAT TIME PERIOD.
LET ME SHOW YOU.
WE HAVE HERE A CIVIL-WAR WEAPON THAT WAS MADE AT WATERTOWN ARSENAL, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS ITEM THAT WE HAVE HAS A SQRE COLLAR.
 IT'S A TINY DETAIL, BUT KRIS  EXPLAINS THAT THE U.S.
MILITARY  ROUTINELY USED SQUARE COLLARS  ON PERCUSSION WEAPONS.
 OUR COLLAR IS RECTANGULAR.
 I ASK KRIS IF SHE THINKS  THERE'S ANYTHING  TO WARREN'S IDEA  THAT THE DEVICE WAS DESIGNED  TO DETER GRAVE ROBBERS.
THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING, BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE.
 AND IF THIS HAD BEEN BURIED,  KRIS SPOTS WHAT APPEARS TO BE  A FATAL FLAW  IN THE DESIGN  OF OUR TORPEDO.
THE OTHER PROBLEM IS, ONCE YOU BURIED IT, YOU'D HAVE DIRT IN HERE, AND THEN HOW WOULD THE HAMMER HIT THE PERCUSSION CAP THAT'S ON THE NIPPLE TO CREATE THE EXPLOSION? BUT IT'S DEFINITELY PROFESSIONALLY MADE, SO IT HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PRACTICAL USE.
YOU KNOW, IF OUR DEVICE REALLY WAS MEANT TO DETER GRAVE ROBBERS, THERE'S GOTO BE SOME ACCOUNT OF ONE OF THESE GOING OFF.
 I TRY SEARCHING ONLINE  TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND  ABOUT GRAVE ALARMS.
 I DON'T TURN ANYTHING UP  SEARCHING UNDER GRAVE ALARMS,  BUT GRAVE TORPEDO,  WHICH IS THE TERM KRIS USED,  RETURNS A CURIOUS HIT.
OKAY, HERE'S AN ARTICLE FROM THE RICHWOOD GAZETTE, 1881 IN OHIO: GRAVE ROBBER KILLED.
THREE MEN WHO ATTEMPTED TO ROB A GRAVE NEAR GANN, IN KNOX COUNTY, OHIO, MET WITH A HORRIBLE OBSTACLE.
WHEN NEARING THE COFFIN, THEY STRUCK A TORPEDO.
SO THESE THINGS REALLY DID EXIST.
 ONE OF THESE DEVICES,  PATENTED IN 1881,  SOUNDS SIMILAR  TO OURS.
THOMAS HOWELL OF CIRCLEVILLE, OHIO, PATENTED AN EXPLODING SHELL THAT WAS BURIED RIGHT ABOVE A COFFIN.
AND IF ROBBERS TRIED TO DIG UP THE COFFIN, THE SHELL WOULD EXPLODE, INJURING OR KILLING THE THIEVES.
 IT APPEARS THAT IN THESE CASES,  AT LEAST, THE GRAVE ROBBERS  WEREN'T TRYING TO SWIPE JEWELRY  AND OTHER VALUABLES,  THEY WERE TRYING  TO STEAL BODIES.
IT SAYS THAT DURING THE 1800s, MEDICAL SCHOOLS STOLE CADAVERS TO DEMONSTRATE GROSS ANATOMY TO THE STUDENTS AND THAT THIS WAS PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM IN OHIO.
 SCOTT GAMPHER IS THE DIRECTOR  OF HISTORY COLLECTIONS  AT THE CINCINNATI MUSEUM CENTER  AT UNION TERMINAL.
 HE'S NEVER SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE OUR DEVICE,  BUT HE UNDERSTANDS THE HISTORIC  NEED TO PREVENT BODY SNATCHING.
THERE WERE A LOT OF DISSECTIONS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE IN THESE MEDICAL COLLEGES, AND THUS A NEED FOR A LOT OF CADAVERS.
 BETWEEN 1865 AND 1890,  THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS  IN THE U.S.
ALMOST DOUBLED.
 CINCINNATI-AREA MEDICAL SCHOOLS  COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER  TO OFFER PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE  TO STUDENTS.
 BUT BODIES WERE NOT  EASY TO COME BY:  THE CHURCH OBJECTED,  AND MANY STATES  ONLY PERMITTED THE BODIES  OF EXECUTED CRIMINALS  TO BE USED FOR DISSECTION.
AND SO, REALLY, THE ONLY AVENUE FOR THESE SCHOOLS TO OBTAIN CADAVERS WAS THROUGH THE BLACK MARKET.
IN OTHER WORDS, BY DOING BUSINESS WITH GRAVE ROBBERS.
 IN THE 1870s, PUBLIC CONCERN  ABOUT BODY SNATCHING  WAS AT A FEVER PITCH  IN OHIO IN PARTICULAR  BECAUSE OF  A NOTORIOUS INCIDENT.
 THE BODY OF  JOHN SCOTT HARRISON,  FATHER OF FUTURE PRESIDENT  BENJAMINM A ROPE  DOWN A DARK SHAFT  AT THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF OHIO,  PROVOKING ENORMOUS OUTRAGE.
IT WAS PARTICULARLY BAD BECAUSE MEASURES HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE HARRISON FAMILY TO PREVENT THIS VERY THING FROM HAPPENING.
 SCOTT SHOWS ME  AN ARTICLE  FROM THE CINCINNATI DAILY COMMERCIAL  WRITTEN IN 1878 JUST AFTER  HARRISON'S BODY WAS STOLEN.
IF CEMENTED WALLS CAREFULLY AND SKILLFULLY CONSTRUCTED, AND VAST WEIGHTS, REQUIRING THE STRENGTH OF MANY MEN TO LIFT, AND HIRED AND PRE-PAID WATCHMEN COULD NOT SAVE THEIR LOVED AND HONORED PARENT'S GRAVE FROM DESECRATION AND DISHONOR, WHAT COULD? WOW.
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOCKED THE PUBLIC SO MUCH: WELL, IF IT COULD HAPPEN TO THE HARRISONS, IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.
 THE PUBLIC HAD  RUN OUT OF WAYS  TO SECURE  THEIR LOVED ONE'S GRAVE,  SO THEY TURNED TO DEADLY  EXPLOSIVES AS A LAST RESORT.
 BUT IS OUR DEVICE REALLY  ONE OF THESE TORPEDOES?  WITHOUT A MAKER'S MARK  OR A CLEAR EXPLANATION  FOR HOW IT MIGHT'VE WORKED,  I'M STILL NOT SURE  WHAT WE HAVE.
 SCOTT PUT ME IN CONTACT  WITH PAUL MAYBERRY,  THE LOCAL HISTORIAN  OF PICKAWAY COUNTY, OHIO.
 PICKAWAY INCLUDES  THE TOWN OF CIRCLEVILLE,  WHERE THOMAS HOWELL  INVENTED HIS TORPEDO.
MY RESEARCH LED ME TO CIRCLEVILLE BECAUSE OF THIS OBJECT.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? WELL, THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING.
 PAUL HAS NEVER SEEN  ONE OF THESE BEFORE,  BUT HE SAYS GRAVE TORPEDOES  HAVE A LONG HISTORY  IN THE REGION.
OUR LOCAL CEMETERY ABOLISHED THE USE OF THEM, I THINK, IN 1890 BECAUSE IT WAS TOO MUCH OF A DANGER TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING IN THE CEMETERY.
SUPPOSEDLY THERE WAS A GUY NAMED THOMAS HOWELL WHO LIVED HERE IN CIRCLEVILLE WHO MADE DEVICES LIKE THIS.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HOWELL? YES, I HAVE.
I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THOMAS HOWELL.
HE WAS A WATCH MAKER AND TIMES GOT A LITTLE TOUGH FOR HIM, AND HE DECIDED TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAD WITH GRAVE ROBBING.
 PAUL ASSEMBLED A NUMBER  OF LOCAL ARTICLES ON HOWELL  THAT HE COPIED  FROM OLD NEWSPAPERS.
THIS IS SOME OF THE ADVERTISING THAT HE DID.
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THE NEWSPAPER FROM JULY 11, 1879.
THE AD SAYS, SLEEP WELL, SWEET ANGEL.
LET NO FEARS OF GHOULS DISTURB THY REST, FOR ABOVE THY SHROUDED FORM LIES A TORPEDO, READY TO MAKE MINCE-MEAT OF ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO CONVEY YOU TO THE PICKLING VAT.
WOW, THAT IS INCREDIBLE! I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD DIRECT MARKETING, ISN'T IT? IT IS.
 BUT THE PICTURE OF HOWELL'S  GRAVE TORPEDO  LOOKS NOTHING LIKE OURS.
 DO WE HAVE  A GRAVE TORPEDO?  AND HOW WOULD IT HAVE WORKED? HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE.
IF YOU SET THIS THING AND YOU PUT IT INTO A GRAVE, WHAT'S TO PREVENT IT FROM EXPLODING IN YOUR FACE? WELL, THIS IS AN INGENIOUS DEVICE.
 WHAT PAUL SHOWS ME NEXT  GIVES ME THE ANSWER I NEED  FOR WARREN.
WHEN YOU FIRST SHOWED ME THIS THING AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SOME SORT OF A GRAVE ALARM, I SAID, COME ON, THIS GUY'S CRAZY! IT COULDN'T BE A GRAVE ALARM.
BUT AS I GOT INTO THE INVESTIGATION, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS NOT SO MUCH AN ALARM AS IT IS A DEADLY WEAPON.
OH, YEAH?  I TELL HENRY  THAT HIS DEVICE WAS DESIGNED  TO DETER THIEVES STEALING  BODIES, NOT VALUABLES.
WELL, THE GUYS I TALKED TO WERE HALF RIGHT, ANYWAY.
HERE'S THE THING I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT: HOW COULD YOU PUT THIS INTO A GRAVE, SET THE TRIGGERS, AND FILL THE GRAVE UP WITHOUT BLOWING YOUR HEAD OFF? YOU GOT ME IN SUSPENSE HERE! THOMAS HOWELL WAS SO SUCCESSFUL WITH HIS FIRST GRAVE TORPEDO THAT HE DESIGNED ANOTHER ONE, AND I HAVE A PATENT FOR THAT ONE HERE.
NO, REALLY? GRAVE TORPEDO, DECEMBER 20, 1881.
 THE OLD PATENT PAPERS  SHOW A CURIOUS PARABOLA,  OR ARC, OVER THE TOP  OF OUR TORPEDO,  AND SUDDENLY I UNDERSTAND HOW  OUR DEVICE IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.
WHAT'S MISSING FROM HERE IS A THIN METAL SHIELD THAT FIT OVER THIS THAT HAD A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE...
RIGHT.
THAT ACCORDING TO THE PATENT PAPERS, YOU'D TAKE A LONG TUBE, LIKE A STANDPIPE, YOU'D PUT A FUNNEL UP AT THE TOP, AFTER THIS IS BURIED IN THE GRAVE...
CORRECT.
AND YOU'D FILL THIS CHAMBER UP WITH GUNPOWDER.
THEN ONCE THE CHAMBER'S FILLED UP, YOU'D DROP A CORK DOWN THE STANDPIPE, OR SOME STOPPER.
 WHEN THE TRIPWIRES SECURED  TO THE COLLAR  ARE DISTURBED  BY A GRAVE ROBBER...
THE THING GOES KA-BOOM! WOW, I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE SAME DEVICE.
 BECAUSE HIS DEVICE  HAS NO MARKINGS ON IT  AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT  AN EXACT MATCH,  HENRY MAY HAVE A PROTOTYPE  OF HOWELL'S PATENTED  GRAVE TORPEDO.
IT'S SO CLOSE THAT IT'S GOT TO BE IT.
IT'S GOT TO BE.
YOU GUYS REALLY DID A JOB ON THIS.
THIS IS WORTH KNOWING.
THIS IS -
I MEAN, THIS IS HISTORY.
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT INVESTIGATION, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS TO ME.
YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE BALL, WES.
PUT 'ER THERE, PAL.
 IN 1881, THE YEAR HOWELL'S  GRAVE TORPEDO WAS PATENTED,  OHIO ENACTED  THE ANATOMY LAW.
 IT PERMITTED MEDICAL SCHOOLS  TO USE UNCLAIMED BODIES  FROM PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
 BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY,  BODY SNATCHING CASES  HAD SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED.
 CADAVER STORAGE AND  PRESERVATION IMPROVED,  ALLOWING SCHOOLS  TO ACCUMULATE BODIES,  AND THE NEED FOR STEALING  FRESH HUMAN CORPSES  WAS A THING OF THE PAST.
EVEN PRESIDENTIAL BURIAL SITES WERE PREY FOR GRAVE ROBBERS.
ELEVEN YEARS AFTER ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION, A CRIMINAL GANG HATCHED A PLOT TO RANSOM HIS CORPSE.
THEY WANTED $200,000 AND THE RELEASE OF AN IMPRISONED COHORT.
ON ELECTION NIGHT 1876, THE THIEVES RAIDED LINCOLN'S TOMB IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.
BUT THE 500-POUND CEDAR AND LEAD COFFIN WAS TOO HEAVY TO MOVE.
TIPPED-OFF SECRET SERVICE AGENTS ARRIVED IN TIME TO CATCH THE WOULD-BE GRAVE ROBBERS IN THE ACT.
AFTER THE ATTEMPTED ROBBERY, THE NATIONAL LINCOLN MONUMENT SOCIETY SECRETLY MOVED LINCOLN'S CORPSE TO ANOTHER PART OF THE TOMB.
FOR YEARS, THE PUBLIC PAID THEIR RESPECTS TO AN EMPTY SARCOPHAGUS.
BEFORE LINCOLN'S BODY WAS LAID TO ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE, IT WAS EXHUMED AND CHECKED TWICE TO MAKE SURE THE CORPSE WAS STILL THERE.
AS A LAST SAFETY MEASURE, IN 1901, PRESIDENT AND MRS.
LINCOLN'S BODIES WERE ENCASED IN LEAD.
THEIR COFFINS WERE CAGED IN STEEL AND BURIED BENEATH 10 FEET OF CEMENT, ENSURING THAT LINCOLN WOULD STAY IN SPRINGFIELD FOREVER.
