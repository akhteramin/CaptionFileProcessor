 FINAL TIP, ABOUT HALF A MINUTE LEFT BEFORE WE'LL HAND IT
 OVER TO "SQUAWK ON THE STREET.
 TURN AROUND STRONG ECONOMIC
 DATA
 UP 2.3 ON THE S&P 500, NASDAQ
 DOWN 3
 MARKET OPENS THE SAME TIME THAT
 THE PRESS CONFERENCE STARTS, I
 THINK.
 DOESN'T IT
 YES.
 YES
 RIGHT AT 9:30 A.M.
 IS NEWSY A WORD?
 IT'S GOING TO BE A NEWSY DAY.
 VERY NEWSY DAY.
 IPOs, POT STUFF, BARR STUFF.
 JOIN US ON MONDAY
 "SQUAWK ON THE STREET" IS NEXT
 I DID IT
 GOOD THURSDAY MORNING
 WELCOME TO "SQUAWK ON STREET."
 I'M CARL QUINTANILLA ALONG WITH
 JIM CRAMER, DAVID FABIAN
 PRESS CONFERENCE IN ABOUT HALF
 HOUR
 FUTURES HAVE GONE POSITIVE
 EUROPE IS HIGHER DESPITE LITTLE
 IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PMIs, BUT
 AWFULLY GOOD DATA HERE
 BEST NUMBERS SINCE 2017.
 WE BEGIN WITH THE IPO WAVE AFTER
 L
 LYFT'S STUMBLE.
 PLUS MUELLER'S MOMENT
 ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR WILL
 ADDRESS REPORTERS THIS HOUR
 BEFORE RELEASING THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S FINDINGS ON THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN
 INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
 AND RETAIL SALES SURGING IN
 MARCH.
 FASTEST PACE IN NEARLY TWO
 YEARS.
 STOCKS ARE SET FOR A GREEN OPEN.
 A PAIR OF UNICORNS ARE
 LAUNCHING THEMSELVES IN THE
 PUBLIC MARKET TODAY.
 PINTEREST BEGINNING TRADE,
 PRICING $2 ABOVE THE HIGH-END OF
 THE RANGE AT 19.
 ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS
 GETTING READY TO GO PUBLIC AT
 THE NASDAQ, PRICING 36 THIS
 YEAR, VALUING THAT COMPANY AT
 MORE THAN $10 BILLION.
 WE'LL TALK TO CEOs OF BOTH
 PINTEREST AND ZOOM ONCE THEY
 BEGIN TRADING, JIM
 BOTH PRICING ABOVE THE RANGE,
 ALTHOUGH LYFT, AS WE SAID --
 PINTEREST BELOW THEIR PRIOR
 ROUND.
 RIGHT
 ZOOM HAS INCREDIBLE GROWTH

 IT'S PROFITABLE.
 GUYS THAT LEFT FROM WEB X, CISCO
 BOUGHT THEM.
 THERE IS A SENSE THAT THESE GUYS
 ARE VERY MUCH THE HOT IPO FOR
 BIG TECH FOR THE YEAR.
 I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW IT'S GOING
 TO OPEN -- IT OPENS WHERE YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT AT 14 TIMES SALES
 AND THAT IS HUMUNGOUS.
 PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW IT'S VERY
 EXPENSIVE.
 IT HAS GREAT GROWTH.
 REPORTED LAST NIGHT, PEOPLE
 REPORTED, CLOSEST ANALOG AND 20
 TIMES SALES.
 LET'S BE CAREFUL
 PINTEREST IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
 11 TIMES 2019 SALES IF IT OPENS
 WHERE IT IS AND EIGHT TIMES FOR
 NEXT YEAR.
 NOTICE WHAT I SAID
 TIMES SALES NOT TIMES EARNINGS
 PINTEREST SHOULD BE PROFITABLE
 NEXT YEAR.
 I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
 THESE STOCKS ARE ALL EXPENSIVE.
 THEY ARE, BUT THEY'RE ALSO
 GROWING VERY QUICKLY.
 YES.
 YOU LOOK AT ZOOM'S NUMBERS,
 WHICH IS PROFITABLE, SLIGHTLY.
 RIGHT.
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A
 COMPANY WHOSE REVENUE WAS 60.8
 MILLION, 151 MILLION AND 30
 MILLION.
 IT'S BIG.
 FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDED 2019
 OR JANUARY 31st, '19
 THEY ARE GENERATING CASH, TO
 YOUR POINT, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
 TRADING AT A VERY HIGH MULTIPLE
 TO BOTH REVENUES.
 RIGHT.
 AND THE LITTLE EARNINGS THEY
 HAVE.
 I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH
 BUSINESS THAT WEB-X, CISCO WILL
 NOT CRUSH THEM
 I USE THE PRODUCT.
 THE ZOOM PRODUCT?
 YES.
 IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION BASED
 VIDEO CONFERENCING
 FOR A PERSON, ORGANIZATION,
 ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS?
 LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO DO AN
 ONLINE PRESENTATION AND YOU
 WANTED TO HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
 TALKING, YOU JUST USE ZOOM
 THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
 IT'S WORKING.
 PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT
 IT
 PINTEREST, THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT

 IT, BECAUSE IT'S BELOW WHERE
 THESE OTHER GUYS BOUGHT IT
 WOW, I'M GETTING IN BELOW.
 I'M GOING TO GO BUY CAMEL?
 NO
 REALLY SMART PEOPLE PAY HIGHER
 SO WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING A
 BARGAIN.
 DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE IN
 THESE TWO TODAY?
 IF IT OPENED BELOW 50, I
 WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED.
 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT --
 IN THE LATE ROUNDS?
 YEAH.
 YOU KNOW, PINTEREST IS ONE
 THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY I
 FINALLY HAVE ANOTHER ONLINE PLAY
 BESIDES FACEBOOK AND TWITTER
 THAT'S HOW PEOPLE VIEW IT.
 THEY WANT IT ONLINE PLAY.
 THEY NEED TO OWN IT, YOU
 FEEL, IN ORDER TO HAVE EXPOSURE,
 TO SOME EXTENT
 YES.
 IT'S NOT ABOUT SHARING.
 RIGHT
 IT'S ABOUT CARING, NOT SHARING
 SEE, MARK ZUCKERBERG SHARES
 EVERYTHING WITH THE RUSSIANS AND
 ANYBODY ELSE
 THESE GUYS ARE CARING.
 IT'S NOT SHARING, IT'S CARING.
 PINTEREST CARES.
 CUTTING THEIR LOSSES IN HALF
 DOESN'T LAST YEAR DOESN'T HURT.
 NO.
 LOOK, THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW HOW TO
 RUN A COMPANY.
 LOOK, VERSUS SNAP, IT IS
 ACTUALLY THE SAME.
 SNAP DOWNGRADED TODAY.
 IT IS THE SAME PRICE OF SALES
 FOR '20 VERSUS SNAP.
 TWITTER IS CHEAPER
 I THINK TWITTER IS DOING WELL
 AND TWITTER IS CHEAPER
 IF YOU LIKE PINTEREST,
 THEORETICALLY, YOU SHOULD LOVE
 TWITTER.
 THINK ABOUT THAT.
 OKAY.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN OKAY SF THIS
 IS FIRST CLASS ANALYSIS.
 I DO NOT DOUBT THAT IT IS.
 NOBODY HAS THIS ANALYSIS.
 NO ONE?
 NO.
 AT LEAST WE DID IT OURSELVES.
 TWITTER, YOU MENTIONED
 TWITTER.
 IT WAS AT 75 COMING OUT OF THE
 GATE.
 THERE'S A PAY TOO MUCH,
 RIGHT?
 THAT WAS A PAY TOO MUCH
 SITUATION.
 SNAP.
 SNAP DID, TOO
 REMEMBER, IT'S THE INDUSTRIALS
 THAT PEOPLE WANT RIGHT NOW
 YOU MEAN SPECIFICALLY THE GREAT
 NUMBER
 HONEY WELL RAISING THEIR
 GUIDE.
 UNITED RENTALS REITERATING THEIR
 GUIDE.
 THE YEAR IS UNFOLDING JUST LIKE
 THEY THOUGHT.
 THEY RAISED THE RENTAL RATES.
 THAT'S WHAT WE WERE WAITING FOR.
 THIS IS GOING TO BE SO STRONG.
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK
 FACEBOOK IS SO WRONG, THIS HAS
 PICKED UP BIG IN MARCH AND
 APRIL.
 I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A FIGHT
 WITH VARIOUS PEOPLE.
 WHAT ABOUT PAPER STOCKS
 TOO MUCH CAPACITY IN PAPERS
 BECAUSE THOSE -- I MEAN, SOME OF
 THOSE PEOPLE THEY KEPT OPENING
 FACTORIES, EXPECTING THAT THINGS
 WILL BE GREAT.
 AMAZON CARDBOARD AND THEY WERE
 THINKING OUT OF PLASTIC INTO
 PAPER.
 IT'S JUST STRAWS

 INTERMODAL
 IF YOU GO TO THE CSX, THEY'RE
 GOING TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE
 DELIVERING THINGS ON TIME IN THE
 RAILS.
 NOT AS MUCH AS INVENTORY
 AS --
 TRUCKING ALSO --
 A MARKET SHARE ISSUE?
 INTERMODAL.
 HOW MANY --
 WE KNOW.
 1800 CONTAINERS ON A
 CONTAINER SHIP, OKAY
 YES.
 WE STOPPED BECAUSE OF THE
 TARIFFS.
 WE DID REALLY BIG.
 WE LOADED UP, TOOK ALL THE STUFF
 IN, BETTING THAT THE TARIFFS
 WOULD GO UP.
 WE WERE FULL UP AND THAT WAS THE
 END.
 IT HAD TO DO WITH THE TARIFFS,
 DAVID.
 DEUTSCH DOES CUT JP TO A
 SELL.
 WHERE WAS HE YESTERDAY?
 IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
 THE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL
 WAS SO HORRIBLE.
 JANUARY WAS BAD, FEBRUARY WAS
 BAD, MARCH WAS BAD
 IT WAS 767 IN TERMS OF DECLINES.
 THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE COMP CALLS
 WE SAID THE FED IS SO RIGHT.
 THEN ON HONEYWELL, WOW, IS THE
 FED WRONG.
 SISTER, MOTHER, SISTER, MOTHER.
 CSX, RAILS MATTER
 CONTINENTAL WAS VERY GOOD.
 RIGHT.
 NOW THERE'S A LOT OF THEM
 THAT ARE REALLY GOOD
 HOW ABOUT INTELL DOING
 COMPLETELY BADLY AND IT GOES UP
 TWO POINTS?
 NOW YOU HAVE A 2020 NUMBER
 DO YOU KNOW THAT THOSE MODEMS
 WEREN'T GOING TO BE READY UNTIL
 2021 AND THEY WERE GOING TO MISS
 CHRISTMAS AT APPLE
 NOW WE HAVE NOT A REFRESH BUT AN
 ENTIRE NEW CYCLE
 5G IS GOING TO BE SO BIG.
 BIG.
 SO BIG.
 WHAT'S THE BEST 5G PLAY
 YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN THE FORM OF
 A QUESTION
 WHAT IS ERICCSON.
 REALLY?
 I'M NOT KIDDING
 WHO ARE THEY WINNING
 UNITED STATES.
 WHO ARE THEY TAKING THE SHARE
 FROM
 CAN'T HEAR YOU
 I'M NOT LISTENING.
 HUAWEI
 WHO IS THAT?
 I'M NOT LISTENING.
 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
 NO.
 I REALLY DON'T
 I SIT HERE AND I DO NOTHING.
 BACK TO THE IPOs.
 BOB PISANI WILL HAVE A BUSY DAY
 ON THE FLOOR WATCHING ALL THAT
 ACTION
 GOOD MORNING, BOB.
 GOOD MORNING, CARL.
 CNBC IS INSIDE THE BOOTH
 GLENN PERELL WILL BE THE
 DESIGNATED MARKET MAKER, HANDLE
 A LOT OF IPOs, TWITTER, ALIBABA.
 WHERE IS EVERYBODY BEHIND HIM?
 WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEE A CROWD.
 THEY'RE ALL UPSTAIRS
 THERE'S A BREAKFAST MEETING
 GOING ON, NYC HOLDS A BREAKFAST
 MEETING FOR EXECUTIVES OF THE
 NEW COMPANY.
 GLENN GOT HERE A COUPLE OF
 MOMENTS AGO.
 BIG DAY DOWN HERE.
 WE HAVE THE UPSIZE FROM
 PINTEREST FROM $19 TO $15 TO

 MORE THAN THAT
 WE HAVE THREE -- NOT ONE, NOT
 TWO, BUT THREE UP SIZE IPOS ON
 THE NASDAQ, ZOOM, $36.
 TALK THERE WAS 28 TO 32.
 THEY'RE IN OIL AND GAS MINERAL
 COMPANY.
 AGAIN THEY UPSIZE.
 THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.
 IPOS MARKET IS COMING OUT OF THE
 GATE VERY, VERY STRONG RIGHT
 NOW.
 LYFT IS A LITTLE BIT OF THE
 OUTLIER.
 JUST THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS
 LOOK AT JUMIA, PAGERDUTY, TUFIN
 SOFTWARE, LEVI STRAUSS, THEY'RE
 ALL COMING OUT OF THE GATE VERY
 STRONG
 LEVI STRAUSS, 38
 LYFT DOWN 17%.
 THAT'S THE OUTLIER
 IS IT THE RIGHT PRICE FOR
 LYFT -- EXCUSE ME, FOR THIS
 PARTICULAR IPO FOR PINTEREST
 LYFT WAS 50% ABOVE THE LAST
 ROUND OF FUNDING

 PINTEREST.
 FINAL NUMBER LOOKS CLOSER TO
 THAT
 ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THERE
 SEEMS TO BE INTENSE DEMAND
 WE'LL BE STANDING HERE 9:30
 TOMORROW, IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR,
 GIVE YOU AN UPDATE AND MAYBE GET
 EARLY INDICATIONS.
 I DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE COMING
 AT 10:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME
 PINTEREST IS SO HIGH IT'S GOING
 TO TAKE A WHILE TO BUILD THAT
 BOOK AND WE'LL EXPLAIN THAT MORE
 AT 9:30.
 GOLDMAN IS THE LEAD BOOK RUNNER,
 CONSULTING WITH GTS, DOWN HERE
 BUILDING THAT BOOK
 I ANTICIPATE THAT WILL BE SOME
 TIME PAST 10:30 AT LEAST
 WE'LL HERE, NEXT HALF HOUR WITH
 AN UPDATE.
 BACK TO YOU.
 BOB PISANI, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH
 I THINK WE HAVE SOME
 CONFIRMATION ON CANOPY ACREAGE
 IS THAT WHAT'S CROSSING?
 YES
 CANOPY IN CANADA, ACREAGE IN
 AMERICA.
 NETWORK OF STORES, GOOD COMBO.
 PAY ATTENTION TO THAT DEAL.
 VERY BIG IN THE SPACE.
 RAPID CONSOLIDATION.
 YES, CONSOLATION GAVE THESE
 GUYS $4 BILLION, BRUCE LITTON
 AND SAID HERE IS THE BALL.
 BRUCE LITTON SAID I AM GOING TO
 MAKE MY STOCK BIGGER THAN YOUR
 STOCK.
 IMAGINE THAT
 BRUCE LITTON
 DO YOU REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS
 YES.
 HE'S BACK, BIGGER THAN EVER
 VERY GOOD MERGER
 THEY'RE TRYING TO LOCK THEM UP
 HATS OFF TO MELISSA.
 SHE HAS BOTH OF THEM.
 ACREAGE IN AMERICA AND THE
 OTHER LARGELY CANADA
 HE HAS NEVER EVEN INHALED
 THOSE JUULETTES, BE CAREFUL, WE
 KILL YOU
 WE'RE GOOD FOR YOU
 SEE THOSE?
 WE'LL TALK TO THE CEO'S OF
 PINTEREST AND ZOOM AS SOON AS
 THEIR STOCKS START TO TRADE.
 ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR IS
 PREPARED TO GIVE A PRESS
 CONFERENCE IN 15 MINUTES AS THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PREPARES TO
 RELEASE THE MUELLER REPORT
 WE'LL TAKE YOU THERE LIVE AS

 SHARES OF BLACKSTONE WAY UP THIS MORNING, REPORTING RESULTS
 THAT IT WILL SHIFT FROM A
 PARTNERSHIP TO A CORPORATE
 STRUCTURE.
 WE CAN SELL TO 4.5 TRILLION
 TO 12.
 IF WE MAKE THIS CHANGE TO BE A
 CORPORATION, LIKE EVERY OTHER
 CORPORATION, THEN WE CAN DOUBLE
 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
 WE STILL HAVE A FEW LEFT WHO
 CAN'T.
 I THINK THAT WILL CHANGE OVER
 TIME.
 IT WILL ALLOW INTERNATIONAL
 AND DOMESTIC INVESTORS TO INVEST
 EASIER.
 THIS IS SOMETHING THEY TALKED
 ABOUT, MADE AN IMPRESSION ON
 KKR DID IT, THE STOCKS HAVE
 BENEFITED.
 THIS IS A QUESTION I'VE ASKED A
 NUMBER OF TIMES.
 THEY'VE PERFORMED VERY WELL FOR
 THEIR INVESTORS YET THE STOCK
 PRICE HAS NOT PERFORMED
 PARTICULARLY WELL OVERALL, NOT
 REFLECTING IN SOME WAYS THE
 SUCCESS OF THE UNDERIING
 BUSINESSES
 IT'S MORE OR LESS TRACK THE S&P
 AND THIS HAS BEEN A FRUSTRATION
 FOR THEM
 IT'S A BELIEF THAT THIS DISCOUNT
 THEY TRADE AT, 36% DISCOUNT WILL
 DISAPPEAR IN TERMS OF BECOMING A
 C-CORP
 6.2% YIELD.
 THE TWO HARDEST PLACES TO GET
 JOBS ARE BLACKSTONE AND GOLDMAN
 SACHS AND THE TWO WORST TRADING
 STOCKS ARE BLACKSTONE AND
 GOLDMAN SACHS.
 WHERE THE YOUNG, SMART PEOPLE
 ARE TRYING TO GO AND WHERE THE
 MONCY TRYING TO GO
 I THINK IT WILL BRING AN
 AFFIRMATIVE WHEEL.
 88 BILLION UNDER MANAGEMENT
 UNBELIEVABLE
 HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE MARKET
 AND SAID, QUOTE, IT'S BEEN A
 GOOD YEAR THAT WE'VE HAD A RUN
 YEAR WITH THE NASDAQ UP ALMOST

 THEN HE HAD POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS
 ON INEQUALITY.
 RIGHT.
 HAVING THE MINIMUM WAGE GO UP
 AND HAVING SCHOOL TEACHERS PAY
 NO TAX, WHICH GOT ATTENTION.
 HE HAS BEEN A GIGANTIC GIVER
 TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT
 JERRY SEINFELD IS FROM
 HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A
 DIFFERENCE
 WHAT CAN I SAY
 I DON'T THINK HE'S BEING
 SOCIALIST.
 I DON'T THINK HE'S BEING HARD
 RIGHT.
 JAMIE DIMON MIGHT POSSIBLY --
 ANY CHANCE OF SUCCESS THERE WITH
 MARIANNE LAKE?
 IMPORTANT MOVE THERE
 YESTERDAY.
 YOU NEED ANOTHER GENERATION THAT
 CONCEIVABLY CAN TAKE OVER AT
 SOME POINT
 HOW MANY GENERAL RAGS HAVE WE
 GONE THROUGH AS WE TALK ABOUT
 SUCCESSION OF JAMIE DIMON?
 AT LEAST THE THIRD.
 YEAH.
 WE'VE GOT BIG BANK EARNINGS,
 BB & T, SUNTRUST GOOD NUMBERS
 BUT JP MORGAN IS UP 10
 I HAVE NO IDEA HOW SOMEONE COULD
 DOWNGRADE THAT RIGHT NOW
 NOTHING IS AS BAD AS THE --
 I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO
 SAY GOLDMAN PEPSI.
 YES
 HOW DID YOU KNOW
 PEPSI TO NEUTRAL AFTER ALL
 THIS TIME.
 THAT WAS AN ILL-ADVISED SELL.
 THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT
 CONFERENCE CALLS OF ALL TIME.
 ANOTHER ONE, REALLY
 A REALLY GREAT ONE.
 THE MOUNTAIN DEW YOU DRINK
 WHEN YOU'RE GAMING, WHAT IS
 THAT, ROCKET FUEL, THAT MUSK
 USED ON THAT FALCON?
 COULD BE.
 DOESN'T HAVE SUGAR, ALCOHOL
 IT'S OCTANE 93.

            Memories.
  What we deliver by delivering.
 THERE'S A LOOK AT PINTEREST, MAKING THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN.
 ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR ON THE
 MULLER REPORT AS IT MAKES ITS
 WAY TO THE PUBLIC.
 WE THINK SOMEWHERE IN THE 11:00
 HOUR IT WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE
 PUBLIC AND CONGRESS ON CD-RANGE
 OF MOTIONS
 CD-ROMS.
 SO THEY'RE MAKING SURE THEY HAVE
 COMPUTERS THAT OPERATE CD-ROMS
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS
 LIGHTLY REDACTED AND A GRANULAR
 LOOK WE THINK, AT THE
 CONCLUSIONS MUELLER MADE ABOUT
 OBSTRUCTION, WHY HE CHOSE TO
 MAKE NO CONCLUSION
 IN THE WORDS OF "THE POST" THERE
 ARE WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD READ
 THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS AS
 INNOCENT.
 I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE ALL
 POISED TO TAKE OVER THE
 WEEKEND'S AIR, BETTING THIS IS
 GOING TO BE DISPOSITIVE.
 NOT CLEAR IT'S GOING TO BE
 DISPOSITIVE.
 ANY SIGN THAT THE MARKET
 CARES AT THIS POINT?
 NO.
 COMPLETELY ACADEMIC
 VINDICATION OF A PRESIDENT
 WHO LOVE THE STOCK MARKET.
 THE GUY DOES LOVE THE STOCK
 MARKET
 HE WANTS IT HIGHER
 WE GET A MISSILE LAUNCH, NORTH
 KOREA, NOBODY CARES.
 WE GET -- BECAUSE WE IMMEDIATELY
 GET -- PEOPLE GET PUT OUT ABOUT
 HOW TALKS ARE CLOSE, TALKS ARE
 CLOSE, TALKS ARE CLOSE
 ANY TIME THE STOCK MARKET GOES
 DOWN, THE TALKS ARE CLOSE.
 AS FOR THE PRESSER ITSELF, A
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON
 DID SAY THIS MORNING THAT IT
 WILL ADDRESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH
 THE WHITE HOUSE INVOKED
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ON ANY OF
 THIS, THE INTERACTION THAT
 JUSTICE HAS HAD WITH THE WHITE
 HOUSE PRIOR TO THIS DISCLOSURE
 TODAY AND THEN FINALLY THE
 PROCESS THAT THEY'VE USED FOR
 REDA
 REDACTION, TO THE DEGREE IT'S
 USED
 AGAIN, THEY SAY IT'S NOT GOING
 TO BE THAT HEAVY.
 LOOK, IT WILL MAKE GOOD
 READING, BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT
 CHANNEL.
 WE HAVE TO COVER IT CLEARLY,
 BECAUSE YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW
 WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN IT
 FOR US, IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY
 WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO, OTHER
 THAN BE EXCITING AND
 ENTERTAINING
 WE'RE ALL GOING TO READ IT, I
 THINK.
 IT'S KIND OF LIKE A NETFLIX
 STORY, RIGHT

 NOT THAT MUCH, IS IT?
 THAT'S THE NEW PRICE, PREMIUM
 PRICE.

 ALL THE STREAMS I WANT
 WHAT KIND OF STREAMS DO I GET
 WITH $15.99 NETFLIX?
 UNLIMITED.
 THANK YOU.
 IF YOU REFERENCE FIREFEST.
 YES.
 BIG HIT, FIREFEST.
 YES.
 FIREFEST REALLY STAYED WITH
 YOU.
 DAVID, IT WAS A CONCERT THAT
 DIDN'T OCCUR.
 I'M AWARE.
 BUT WHAT WAS IT, SOMEBODY
 WANTED -- JUST KIDDING, I KNOW
 BUT I THINK THIS IS LIKE THE
 MOVIES
 IT COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY.
 MAYBE IMPLICATIONS ON THE
 PRESIDENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH
 CHINA AND TRADE WHICH, BY THE
 WAY, WE'RE NOW GETTING REPORTS
 ABOUT MAYBE SOMETHING BY THE END
 OF MAY
 CHINA SAYS THERE'S STILL WORK TO
 BE DONE.
 DIM NOCHLT, BY THE WAY, ON THE
 TAPE THIS MORNING, JAMIE DIMON.
 ONE THING THAT WASN'T
 MENTIONED WAS OXY.
 REMEMBER FENTANYL, THE PRESIDENT
 CARES PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE
 DUMPING OF FENTANYL.
 WE HAVE AN OPIOID CRISIS IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 YES, WE DO.
 IT'S MADE LARGELY IN CHINA.
 BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD
 START.
 YES, THEY SAID THEY WOULD
 CRACK DOWN
 IT'S NOT MONOLITHIC.
 YOU KNOW, CHINA IS --
 LOOK, THE CHINESE DO THIS
 THEY EXECUTE FOR WHITE COLLAR.
 IT'S A POSITIVE, CERTAINLY,
 IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH
 OUR ENORMOUS OPIOID CRISIS IN
 THIS COUNTRY
 SO MANY DEATHS.
 THAT WAS AFTER NAVARRO'S
 SPEECH WHERE HE SAID I'LL KNOW
 YOUR INTENT IF YOU STOP THE
 FENTANYL AND THEN THEY SAID
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT REAL
 SANCTIONS.
 SANCTIONS THERE USUALLY MEANS
 EXECUTION.
 YEAH.
 THERE'S BEN SILVERMAN ON THE
 POST OF THE EXCHANGE NEXT TO
 STACEY CUNNINGHAM OF THE NEW
 YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
 HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT FROM BEN
 HE HAS MADE SOME APPEARANCES AT
 RECODE CONFERENCE OUT IN
 CALIFORNIA
 INVESTORS WILL GET TO KNOW HIM
 IN A HURRY.
 YEAH.
 THIS IS THE BENIGN PLAY.
 IT'S BENIGN.
 IT DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.
 DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY
 THEY'RE NOT ABOUT SHARING.
 NO.
 THEY'RE ABOUT YOU BUYING SHOES.
 GOING DEEP ON YOU, EXPLORING
 YOURSELF.
 RIGHT, EXPLORE YOURSELF
 WHILE WE'RE WAITING, UNION
 PACIFIC IS UP $6, OKAY
 THAT IS, AGAIN, CSX.
 I DEFY YOU TO TELL ME THAT THE
 ECONOMY IS NOT GETTING BETTER
 AND BETTER.
 WE'LL TALK TO LANCE FRITZ AT

 SO GOOD
 ASK HIM ABOUT HIRING PEOPLE
 COMING OUT OF JAIL
 SO GOOD AT THAT.
 THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY'VE
 TAKEN SHARE.
 THEIR PRICING POWER BECOMES MORE
 EVIDENT.
 FABULOUS CEO, SO UMBLE.
 I'VE TRIED TO GET HIM TO SAY
 BASICALLY HOW GOOD THEY ARE.
 THAT'S NOT HIS STYLE
 BUT HE IS A REALLY GOOD CEO.
 ZOOM, THE OTHER MAJOR IPO
 TODAY.
 BOTH OF THESE NAMES, BY THE WAY,
 WELL OVER SUBSCRIBED
 I THINK 20 TIMES THE CASE I'VE
 HEARD FOR PINTEREST.
 MORE THAN THAT FOR ZOOM.
 WE'LL SEE HOW THEY PERFORM AFTER
 MARKET
 THE EXPECTATIONS ARE, GIVEN THE
 DEMAND FOR ZOOM.
 WE'LL TALK TO ERIC HUANG
 LATER WHO SAYS HOW HIS VISA WAS
 REJECTED TWO TIMES AND IT WAS
 FINALLY APPROVED
 HE IS SET TO BE A BILLIONAIRE
 TODAY.
 THEY'RE TOP OF THE GAME
 GREAT PRODUCT.
 IT'S SOMETHING TANGIBLE THAT
 PEOPLE GET AHOLD OF GREAT
 PRODUCT.
 THE MOST EXPENSIVE STOCK THAT'S
 PROFITABLE
 MOST EXPENSIVE ONE
 BIGGER THAN THAT LAST.
 [ BELL RINGS ]
 THERE'S THE OPENING BELL.
 NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE
 NASDAQ
 PINTEREST, WE'LL TALK WITH CEO
 BEN SILVERMAN AFTER THE OPENING
 TRADE AT THE NASDAQ, IT IS ZOOM.
 TODAY IS A DAY WE'RE TRYING
 TO FIND OUT IF BERNIE SANDERS
 WILL CONTINUE TO KILL THIS
 MARKET
 ONE THING THAT KILLED THE HEALTH
 CARE STOCKS.
 IT WAS, LET'S SAY, THE STRAW
 THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK WHEN
 BERNIE SANDERS CAME ON, MEDICARE
 FOR ALL.
 WAIT A SECOND, REPUBLICANS, OR
 ELSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HIM ON,
 DEMOCRATS, PRESIDENT
 AND THEY STILL CAN'T RECOVER.
 THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION
 ABOUT THIS
 HEALTH CARE HAS UNDERPERFORMED
 THE S&P OVER THE LAST TEN DAYS,
 THE MOST IN TEN YEARS.
 DO INVESTORS REALLY BELIEVE
 DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE THE WHITE
 HOUSE AND THE SENATE WHERE THEY
 HAVE ABOUT A THIRD PERCENT --
 30% CHANCE
 IT'S A GREAT QUESTION
 I THINK THEY FEAR WHAT HAPPENED
 WHEN OBAMA GOT IN.
 THEN THEY HAD BOTH THE HOUSE AND
 SENATE, WHEN THESE WENT TO AN
 EIGHT TIMES, EIGHT
 PROFITS OVER NINE, TEN YEARS
 I THINK THE SELLERS WILL COME
 BACK, BUT IT'S GETTING NEARER
 WHERE YOU HAD GIGANTIC VOLUME AT
 THE BOTTOM YESTERDAY FOR SOME OF
 THESE.
 THE SELLERS ARE ALMOST DONE.
 AT THE SAME TIME, YOU DON'T WANT
 TO OWN HEALTH CARE
 YOU WANT TO OWN INDUSTRIALS.
 AND THE INDUSTRIALS ARE SUCKING
 UP ALL THE MONEY
 HONEYWELL.
 HONEYWELL, 192 BEATS 183.
 STEVE TOUSA, THAT WAS HIS
 FAVORITE STOCK
 HE HAD ABOVE NUMBERS
 HE WAS RIGHT ONCE AGAIN.
 KIND OF ANNOYING HOW RIGHT HE
 HAS BEEN
 HONEYWELL WAS ABSOLUTELY
 TERRIFIC
 DYNAMITE
 SIMPLE BUILDING CLIMATE WAS UP
 NINE
 REALLY AMAZING, DAVID.
 DID NOT TAKE THE BAIT FROM
 THE ACTIVIST IN TERMS OF A FULL
 SPLIT BUT WENT ABOUT SOME
 SMALLER DIVESTITURES.
 RIGHT.
 IS GREG COMING ON
 HAYES
 I'M NOT AWARE OF PLANS ON HIS
 PART TO JOIN US ANY TIME SOON.
 WE ALWAYS WELCOME MR. HAYES.
 YOU'LL GET HIM AND I'LL SIT
 BACK AND ENJOY THE -- PEOPLE ARE
 STILL REELING FROM THE
 MOLLENKOPF VERSUS COOK THING
 I SAY BURY THE HATCHET.
 CLEARLY MR. MOLLENKOPF WAS
 INTERESTED IN BURYING THE
 HATCHET.
 QUALCOMM IS DOWN TODAY.
 IT'S A MOTH TO FLAME.
 A LOT MORE FOCUS ON 5G AS YOU
 HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, JIM.
 RIGHT.
 GIVEN THAT, IT REFOCUSED
 PEOPLE ON THE OPPORTUNITY, IN
 TERMS OF THE 5G CHIP SETS, APPLE
 AND THE LARGER ECOSYSTEM
 YOU MENTIONED ERICCSON EARLIER
 IN TERMS OF THAT SIDE.
 RIGHT
 SOME SELLERS ARE COMING INTO
 TECH TODAY, INTERESTING.
 THEY DO SAY THEY THINK WE'RE
 PAST THE BOTTOM OF THE CYCLE.
 THEY DID.
 YEAH.
 OKAY.
 AND THEN SAMSUNG, OF COURSE,
 ALL OF SOUTH KOREA WAS WEAK
 BECAUSE OF THESE REPORTS ABOUT
 THE GALAXY FOLD.
 AND APPLE STOCK HAS BEEN
 GOING UP EVER SINCE.
 SAMSUNG IS STILL VERY MUCH DOING
 A WILL THE OF STUFF, 5G,
 CORNERED THEIR OWN MARKET.
 I'VE NEVER SEEN A SITUATION
 WHERE EVERYONE WAS BUYING A
 STOCK OFF THE PHONE AND NOW
 THEY'RE SELLING.
 LET'S GET TO THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT AND LISTEN TO THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL, WILLIAM BARR.
 GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY
 THANKS FOR BEING HERE THIS
 MORNING.
 AS YOU KNOW, MARCH 22nd, SPECIAL
 COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER CONCLUDED
 HIS INVESTIGATION INTO MATTERS
 RELATED TO RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO
 INTERFERE IN OUR 2016
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND HE
 SUBMITTED HIS CONFIDENTIAL
 REPORT TO ME, PURSUANT TO
 DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS
 AS I SAID DURING MY SENATE
 CONFIRMATION HEARING AND SINCE,
 I'M COMMITTED TO ENSURING THE
 GREATEST DEGREE POSSIBLE OF
 TRANSPARENCY CONCERNING THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION,
 CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW.
 AT 11:00 THIS MORNING, I'M GOING
 TO TRANSMIT COPIES OF THE PUBLIC
 VERSION OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 REPORT TO THE CHAIRMAN AND
 RANKING MEMBERS OF THE SENATE
 AND HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES
 THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL
 ALSO MAKE THE REPORT AVAILABLE
 TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY
 POSTING IT ON THE DEPARTMENT'S
 WEBSITE AFTER IT HAS BEEN
 DELIVERED TO CONGRESS.
 I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FEW
 COMMENTS TODAY ON THE REPORT
 BEFORE I DO THAT, I WANT TO
 THANK DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
 ROD ROSENSTEIN FOR JOINING ME
 HERE TODAY AND FOR HIS
 ASSISTANCE AND COUNSEL
 THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.
 ROD, AS YOU KNOW, HAS SERVED AT
 THE DEPARTMENT FOR NEARLY 30
 YEARS WITH DEDICATION AND
 DISTINCTION AND IT'S BEEN A
 GREAT PRIVILEGE AND PLEASURE FOR
 ME TO WORK WITH HIM SINCE MY
 CONFIRMATION
 HE HAD WELL-DESERVED PLANS TO
 STEP BACK FROM PUBLIC SERVICE
 THAT WERE INTERRUPTED BY MY
 ASKING HIM TO HELP IN MY
 TRANSITION
 ROD HAS BEEN AN INVALUABLE
 PARTNER, AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT
 HE IS WILLING TO HELP ME AND HAS
 BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION THROUGH
 TO ITS CONCLUSION.
 THANKS, ROD.
 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK
 SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER
 FOR HIS SERVICE AND THE
 THOROUGHNESS OF HIS
 INVESTIGATION, PARTICULARLY HIS
 WORK EXPOSING THE NATURE OF
 RUSSIA'S ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE
 WITH OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS
 AS YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PRIMARY
 PURPOSES OF THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION WAS TO
 DETERMINE WHETHER PRESIDENT
 TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN OR ANY
 INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATED WITH IT
 CONSPIRED OR COORDINATED WITH
 THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO
 INTERFERE IN THE 2016 ELECTION
 VOLUME ONE OF THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S REPORT DESCRIBES THE
 RESULTS OF THAT INVESTIGATION.
 AS YOU WILL SEE THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S REPORT STATES THAT
 HIS, QUOTE, INVESTIGATION DID
 NOT ESTABLISH THAT MEMBERS OF
 THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN CONSPIRED OR
 COORDINATED WITH THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT IN ITS ELECTION
 INTERFERENCE ACTIVITIES.
 I AM SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS
 SHARE MY CONCERN ABOUT THE
 EFFORTS OF THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT TO INTERFERE IN OUR
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
 AS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT
 MAKES CLEAR, THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TO INTERFERE
 IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS, BUT
 THANKS TO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, WE NOW
 KNOW THAT THE RUSSIAN OPERATIVES
 WHO PERPETRATED THESE SCHEMES
 DID NOT HAVE THE COOPERATION OF
 PRESIDENT TRUMP OR THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN, OR THE KNOWING
 ASSISTANCE OF ANY OTHER AMERICAN
 FOR THAT MATTER.
 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ALL
 AMERICANS CAN AND SHOULD BE
 GRATEFUL TO HAVE CONFIRMED
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT
 OUTLINES TWO MAIN EFFORTS BY THE
 RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO INFLUENCE
 THE 2016 ELECTION.
 FIRST, THE REPORT DETAILS
 EFFORTS BY THE INTERNET RESEARCH
 AGENCY, A RUSSIAN COMPANY WITH
 CLOSE TIES TO THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT, TO SOW SOCIAL
 DISCORD IN AMERICAN VOTERS BY
 SPREADING MISINFORMATION
 CHARGES IN FEDERAL COURT WERE
 BROUGHT AGAINST SEVERAL RUSSIAN
 INTERNATIONALS AND ENTITIES FOR
 THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES IN THIS
 SCHEME
 THOSE CHARGES REMAIN PENDING AND
 THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS REMAIN
 AT LARGE
 BUT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FOUND NO
 EVIDENCE THAT ANY AMERICAN,
 INCLUDING ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH
 THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, CONSPIRED OR
 COORDINATED WITH THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT OR THE IRA IN THIS
 ILLEGAL SCHEME
 INDEED, AS THE REPORT STATES,
 QUOTE, THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT
 IDENTIFY EVIDENCE THAT ANY U.S.
 PERSON, KNOWINGLY OR
 INTENTIONALLY, COORDINATED WITH
 THE IRA'S INTERFERENCE
 OPERATION, UNQUOTE
 PUT ANOTHER WAY, THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL FOUND NO COLLUSION BY
 ANY AMERICANS IN IRA'S ILLEGAL
 ACTIVITIES
 SECOND, THE REPORT DETAILS
 EFFORTS BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY
 INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION TO
 HACK INTO COMPUTERS AND STEAL
 DOCUMENTS AND EMAILS FROM
 INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND HILLARY
 CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE
 PURPOSE OF EVENTUALLY
 PUBLICIZING THESE DOCUMENTS.
 OBTAINING SUCH UNAUTHORIZE D
 FOLLOWING A THOROUGH
 INVESTIGATION OF THESE HACKING
 OPERATIONS, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST RUSSIAN
 MILITARY OFFICERS FOR THEIR
 RESPECTIVE ROLES IN THESE
 ILLEGAL HACKING OPERATIONS
 THOSE CHARGES ARE STILL PENDING
 AND THE DEFENDANTS REMAIN AT
 LARGE.
 BUT AGAIN, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 REPORT DID NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE
 THAT MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN OR ANYONE ASSOCIATED
 WITH THE CAMPAIGN CONSPIRE D OR
 COORDINATED WITH THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT IN THESE HACKING
 OPERATIONS
 IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WAS NO
 EVIDENCE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
 COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT'S HACKING
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 INVESTIGATION ALSO EXAMINED
 RUSSIAN EFFORTS TO PUBLISH
 STOLEN EMAILS AND DOCUMENTS ON
 THE INTERNET
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FOUND THAT
 AFTER THE GIU DISSEMINATED SOME
 OF THE STOLEN DOCUMENTS TO
 ENTITIES THAT IT CONTROLLED,
 D.C. LEAKS AND GOOSIFER TWO, GIU
 TRANSFERRED SOME OF THE
 DOCUMENTS TO WIKILEAKS FOR
 PUBLICATION.
 WIKILEAKS THEN MADE A SERIES OF
 DOCUMENT DUMPS
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ALSO
 INVESTIGATED WHETHER ANY MEMBER
 OR AFFILIATE OF THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN ENCOURAGED OR OTHERWISE
 PLAYED A ROLE IN THESE DIS
 DISEMANATION EFFORTS
 THESE ACTS WOULD NOT BE CRIMINAL
 UNLESS THE PUBLISHER ALSO
 PARTICIPATED IN THE UNDERLYING
 HACKING CONSPIRACY
 HERETO, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 REPORT DID NOT FIND THAT ANY
 PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN ILLEGALLY PARTICIPATED
 IN THE DISEMINATION OF THE
 MATERIALS.
 DURING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL
 CAMPAIGN, AFTER REVIEWING THESE
 CONTACTS, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 DID NOT FIND ANY CONSPIRACY TO
 VIOLATE U.S. LAW INVOLVING
 RUSSIAN LINKED PERSONS AND ANY
 PERSONS LINKED WITH THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN
 THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE
 AFTER NEARLY TWO YEARS OF
 INVESTIGATION, THOUSANDS OF
 SUBPOENAS, HUNDREDS OF WARRANTS
 AND WITNESS INTERVIEWS, THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL CONFIRM ED TO
 INTERFERE WITH THE 2016
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BUT DID
 NOT FIND THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
 OR OTHER AMERICANS CLOOUDED IN
 THOSE EFFORTS.
 AFTER FINDING NO UNDERLYING
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA, THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S REPORT GOES ON
 TO CONSIDER WHETHER CERTAIN
 ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT COULD
 AMOUNT TO OBSTRUCTION OF THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION.
 AS I ADDRESSED IN MY MARCH 24th
 LETTER, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL DID
 NOT MAKE A PROSECUTORIAL
 DECISION REGARDING THIS
 ALLEGATION
 TEN EPISODES INVOLVING THE
 PRESIDENT AND DISCUSSES
 POTENTIAL LEGAL THEORIES OF
 CONNECTING THOSE TO AN
 OBSTRUCTION OFFENSE.
 AFTER REVIEWING THE THEORIES
 OUTLINED IN THE REPORT AND WITH
 CONSULTATION OF THE OFFICE OF
 LEGAL COUNSEL AND OTHER LAWYERS,
 THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
 I CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE
 DEVELOPED BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH
 THAT THE PRESIDENT COMMITTED AN
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE OFFENSE
 ALTHOUGH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY
 GENERAL AND I DISAGREED WITH
 SOME OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 LEGAL THEORIES AND FELT THAT
 SOME OF THE EPISODES EXAMINED
 DID NOT AMOUNT TO OBSTRUCTION AS
 A MATTER OF LAW, WE DID NOT RELY
 SOLELY ON THAT IN MAKING OUR
 DECISION
 INSTEAD, WE ACCEPTED THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR
 PURPOSES OF OUR ANALYSIS AND
 EVALUATED THE EVIDENCE AS
 PRESENTED BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 IN REACHING OUR CONCLUSIONS.
 IN ASSESSING THE PRESIDENT'S
 ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT,
 IT IS IMPORTANT TO BEAR IN MIND
 THE CONTEXT.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP FACED AN
 UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION.
 AS HE ENTERED INTO OFFICE AND
 SOUGHT TO PERFORM HIS
 RESPONSIBILITIES AS PRESIDENT,
 FEDERAL AGENTS AND PROSECUTORS
 WERE SCRUTINIZING HIS CONDUCT
 BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING OFFICE
 AND THE CONDUCT OF SOME OF HIS
 ASSOCIATES
 AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WAS
 RELENTLESS SPECULATION IN THE
 NEWS MEDIA ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S
 PERSONAL CULPABILITY, YET AS HE
 SAID FROM THE BEGINNING, THERE
 WAS, IN FACT, NO COLLUSION
 AND AS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 REPORT ACKNOWLEDGES, THERE IS
 SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SHOW
 THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS
 FRUSTRATED AND ANGERED BY HIS
 SINCERE BELIEF THAT THE
 INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERMINING
 HIS PRESIDENCY, PROPELLED BY HIS
 POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND FUELED
 BY ILLEGAL LEAKS
 NONETHELESS, THE WHITE HOUSE
 FULLY COOPERATED WITH THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION,
 PROVIDING UNFEDDERED ACCESS TO
 CAMPAIGN AND WHITE HOUSE
 DOCUMENTS, DIRECTING SENIOR
 AIDES TO TESTIFY FREELY AND
 ASSERTING NO PRIVILEGE CLAIMS.
 AT THE SAME TIME THE PRESIDENT
 TOOK NO ACT THAT, IN FACT,
 DEPRIVED THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OF
 THE DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES
 NECESSARY TO COMPLETE HIS
 INVESTIGATION.
 APARTMENT FROM WHETHER THE ACTS
 WERE OBSTRUCTIVE, THIS EVIDENCE
 OF NONCORRUPT MOTIVES WEIGHS
 HEAVILY AGAINST ANY ALLEGATION
 THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD A CORRUPT
 INTENT TO OBSTRUCT THE
 INVESTIGATION.
 NOW BEFORE I TAKE QUESTIONS, I
 WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW ASPECTS OF
 THE PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE
 PUBLIC REPORT THAT I AM
 RELEASING TODAY.
 AS I SAID SEVERAL TIMES, THE
 REPORT CONTAINS LIMITED
 REDACTIONS, RELATED TO FOUR
 CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION.
 TO ENSURE AS MUCH TRANSPARENCY
 AS POSSIBLE, THOSE REDACTIONS
 HAVE BEEN CLEARLY LABELED SO
 THAT THE READERS CAN TELL WHICH
 REDACTIONS CORRESPOND TO WHICH
 CATEGORIES
 AS I DO RECALL, THOSE CATEGORIES
 ARE 6E MATERIAL, GRAND JURY
 MATERIAL, INFORMATION THAT THE
 IC BELIEVES WOULD DISCLOSE
 SOURCES AND METHODS, INFORMATION
 THAT WOULD IMPAIR THE
 INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF
 OTHER CASES THAT ARE UNDER WAY
 AND, FINALLY, INFORMATION THAT
 IMPLICATES THE PRIVACY AND
 REPUTATIONAL INTERESTS OF
 PERIPHERAL THIRD PARTIES
 AS YOU WILL SEE, MOST OF THE
 REDACTIONS WERE COMPELLED BY THE
 NEED TO PREVENT HARM TO ONGOING
 MATTERS AND TO COMPLY WITH COURT
 ORDERS, PROHIBITING THE PUBLIC
 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
 BEARING ON ONGOING
 INVESTIGATIONS IN CRIMINAL
 CASES, SUCH AS THE IRA CASE AND
 THE ROGER STONE CASE
 THESE REDACTIONS WERE APPLIED BY
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEYS,
 WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER WITH
 ATTORNEYS FROM THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND
 PROSECUTORS THAT ARE HANDLING
 THE ONGOING CASES.
 THE REDACTIONS ARE THEIR WORK
 PRODUCT.
 NO REDACTIONS DONE BY ANYBODY
 OUTSIDE THIS GROUP
 THERE WERE NO REDACTIONS DONE BY
 ANYBODY OUTSIDE THIS GROUP
 NO ONE OUTSIDE THIS GROUP
 PROPOSED ANY REDACTIONS AND NO
 ONE OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT HAS
 SEEN THE UNREDACTED REPORT WITH
 THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN
 SECTIONS THAT WERE MADE
 AVAILABLE TO I.C., THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR
 ADVICE OR PROTECTING
 INTELLIGENCE SOURCES
 CONSISTENT WITH LONGSTANDING
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH PRACTICE, THE
 DECISION WHETHER TO ASSERT
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER ANY
 PORTION OF THE REPORT RESTED
 WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES
 BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE HAD
 VOLUNTARILY COOPERATED WITH THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL, SIGNIFICANT
 PORTIONS OF THE REPORT CONTAINED
 MATERIAL OVER WHICH THE
 PRESIDENT COULD HAVE ASSERTED
 PRIVILEGE.
 AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL
 WITHIN HIS RIGHTS TO DO SO
 FOLLOWING MY MARCH 29th LETTER,
 THE OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL REQUESTED THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE
 REDACTED VERSION OF THE REPORT
 IN ORDER TO ADVISE THE PRESIDENT
 AND THE POTENTIAL INVOCATION OF
 PRIVILEGE, WHICH IS CONSISTENT
 WITH LONGSTANDING PRACTICE
 FOLLOWING THAT REVIEW, THE
 PRESIDENT CONFIRMED THAT IN THE
 INTEREST OF TRANSPARENCY AND
 FULL DISCLOSURE TO THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE, HE WOULD NOT ASSERT
 PRIVILEGE OVER THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S REPORT
 ACCORDINGLY, THE PUBLIC REPORT I
 AM RELEASING TODAY CONTAINS
 REDACTIONS ONLY FOR THE FOUR
 CATEGORIES THAT I PREVIOUSLY
 OUTLINED AND NO MATERIAL HAS
 BEEN REDACTED BASED ON EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE.
 IN ADDITION, EARLIER THIS WEEK,
 THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL COUNSEL
 REQUESTED AND WAS GIVEN THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO READ A FINAL
 VERSION OF THE REDACTED REPORT
 BEFORE IT WAS PUBLICLY RELEASED.
 THAT REQUEST WAS CONSISTENT WITH
 THE PRACTICE FOLLOWED UNDER THE
 ETHICS AND GOVERNMENT ACT, WHICH
 PERMITTED INDIVIDUALS NAMED IN A
 REPORT PREPARED BY INDEPENDENT
 COUNSEL THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ
 THE REPORT BEFORE PUBLICATION.
 THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYERS
 WERE NOT PERMITTED TO MAKE AND
 DID NOT REQUEST ANY REDACTIONS
 IN ADDITION TO MAKING THE
 REDACTED REPORT PUBLIC, WE ARE
 ALSO WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO
 ACCOMMODATE THEIR LEGITIMATE
 OVERSIGHT INTEREST WITH RESPECT
 TO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 INVESTIGATION.
 WE HAVE BEEN CONSULTING WITH
 CHAIRMAN GRAHAM AND CHAIRMAN
 NADLER THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO  THE LIM
 REDACTIONS, I BELIEVE THAT THE
 PUBLICLY RELEASED REPORT WILL
 ALLOW EVERY AMERICAN TO
 UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION.
 NEVERTHELESS, IN AN EFFORT TO
 ACCOMMODATE CONGRESSIONAL
 REQUESTS, WE WILL MAKE
 AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO
 APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS, TO A
 BIPARTISAN GROUP OF LEADERS FROM
 SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES
 A VERSION OF THE REPORT WITH ALL
 REDACTIONS REMOVED EXCEPT THOSE
 RELATING TO GRAND JURY
 INFORMATION.
 THUS THESE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 WILL BE ABLE TO SEE ALL OF THE
 REDACTED MATERIAL FOR THEMSELVES
 WITH A LIMITED EXCEPTION OF THAT
 WHICH BY LAW CANNOT BE SHARED.
 I BELIEVE THAT THIS
 ACCOMMODATION, TOGETHER WITH MY
 UPCOMING TESTIMONY BEFORE THE
 SENATE AND HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEES, WILL SATISFY ANY
 NEED CONGRESS HAS FOR
 INFORMATION REGARDING THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION.
 ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, AND I
 WILL NOW HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.
 MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL, WE
 DON'T HAVE THE REPORT IN HAND.
 SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN FOR US THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S ARTICULATED
 REASON FOR NOT REACHING A
 DECISION ON OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE AND IF IT HAD ANYTHING
 TO DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S
 LONG-STANDING GUIDANCE ON NOT
 INDICTING A SITTING PRESIDENT
 AND YOU SAY YOU DISAGREE WITH
 SOME OF HIS LEGAL THEORIES, WHAT
 DID YOU DISAGREE WITH HIM ON
 THE -- I LEAVE IT TO HIS
 DESCRIPTION IN THE REPORT, THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OWN
 ARTICULATION OF WHY HE DID NOT
 WANT TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS
 TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS AN
 OBSTRUCTION OFFENSE.
 PUT I WILL SAY WHEN WE MET WITH
 HIM, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
 ROSENSTEIN AND I MET WITH HIM
 ALONG WITH ED OWE CALLAHAN, WHO
 IS THE PRINCIPLE ASSOCIATE
 DE
 DEPUTY, ON MARCH 5th, WE
 SPECIFICALLY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE
 OLC OPINION AND WHETHER OR
 NOT --
 A SPLIT SCREEN THERE BETWEEN
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE
 INDICATION ON PINTEREST, 21 TO
 22 THE HEADLINES OUT OF THE
 JUSTICE PRESSER, THE REPORT OUT
 OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE
 CONFIRMS THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT
 DID SEEK TO MEDDLE IN THE 2016
 CAMPAIGN, DID NOT HAVE THE
 COOPERATION OF THE PRESIDENT OR
 HIS CAMPAIGN, REFERENCE TO TEN
 EPISODES INVOLVING POTENTIAL
 OBSTRUCTION BY THE PRESIDENT,
 BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GOING
 ON TO SAY THAT THE EVIDENCE OF
 NONCORRUPT MOTIVES WEIGH HEAVILY
 AGAINST THOSE ALLEGATIONS.
 EAMON JAVERS, WE HAVE THE PRESS
 CONFERENCE NOW UNDER OUR BELTS
 AND WE WILL AWAIT THE HARD COPY.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 I THINK THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
 THING YOU HEARD THERE FROM THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ON THAT
 ISSUE THAT YOU MENTIONED OF
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, WHAT
 HE'S SAYING THERE GOES A LITTLE
 BIT FURTHER IN TERMS OF
 EXPLANATION FOR HIS OWN DECISION
 AS TO WHY MUELLER'S FINDINGS ON
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
 ULTIMATELY DON'T MOUNT TO A
 CHARGEABLE OFFENSE HERE OF
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
 WHAT BARR IS SAYING IS THOUGH
 THERE MAY BE EVIDENCE OF
 OBSTRUCTIVE ACTS BY THE
 PRESIDENT THAT WE'LL READ ABOUT
 IN THIS REPORT, ULTIMATELY THE
 PRESIDENT DIDN'T HAVE CORRUPT
 INTENT BECAUSE HE ALSO DIDN'T
 FIRE MUELLER, DIDN'T TAKE ANY
 STEPS TO BLOCK THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION, AND HE
 SAYS THAT GOES A LONG WAY TO
 GETTING PAST THIS IDEA THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAD ANY CRIMINAL
 INTENT IN TERMS OF OBSTRUCTION
 OF JUSTICE
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THERE
 SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE IF THE
 PRESIDENT HAD TAKEN SOME OF
 THOSE STEPS, IT MIGHT BE A
 DIFFERENT SITUATION.
 BUT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT
 COOPERATED FULLY, DIDN'T TAKE
 ANY STEPS TO BLOCK THE
 INVESTIGATION, AND THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL'S MIND, THIS WASN'T
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 ALL RIGHT
  UNFETTERED ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS,
 ASSERTING NO PRIVILEGE, NO
 PROPOSED REDACTIONS, WE'LL KEEP
 OUR EYE ON THIS STORY LATER ON
 THIS MORNING
 IN THE MEANTIME, JIM, DOW ADDED
 TO ITS GAINS SLIGHTLY ON THE
 NEWS
 YEAH.
 LOOK, I THINK ANYTHING THAT
 MAKES THE PRESIDENT IS CLEARLY
 VIEWED AS BEING PRO STOCK.
 THIS PINTEREST, WANT TO GO OVER
 THIS AGAIN, IT IS EXPENSIVE.
 BUT NO ONE THINKS -- IT IS NOT
 IT IS GOING TO BE PROPABLE NEXT
 YEAR
 BUT IT IS THE CHIP
 PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING INTERNET
 THAT IS FRESH FACED AND VIEWED
 AS BEING A POSITIVE COMPANY.
 ACTUAL POSITIVE COMPANY.
 AND PINTEREST IS THAT.
 I THINK IT WILL BRING IN SELLING
 OF OTHER TECHES THAT -- BECAUSE
 COMPANIES THAT ARE BUYING
 PINTEREST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
 MONEY TO TAKE IN PINTEREST AND
 NOT HAVE TO SELL SOMETHING
 I SAY PRESSURE ON FACEBOOK HERE.
 SEE ANY INDICATION MOVE UP
 22, 23 NOW, PRICING AT $19
 THAT WOULD GIVE IT A MARKET CAP
 ABOVE $12 BILLION.
 ACTUALLY A BIT MORE.
 ABOVE THE LAST ROUND --
 THAT'S IMPORTANT.
 I THINK WE'RE ITCHING FOR
 SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT
 IS NEW, THAT ISN'T TWITTER, THAT
 ISN'T FACEBOOK
 THIS IS THE KINDLER, GENTLER
 INTERNET PLAY.
 BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS
 ENOUGH MONEY AROUND TO OWN
 FACEBOOK AND PINTEREST IF YOU
 ARE A BIG TECH BUYER
 JUST DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS.
 BY THE WAY, LET'S LUMP IN A
 SALES FORCE.
 SMALL ACQUISITION, I THOUGHT IT
 WAS GOOD
 SELL SALES FORCE TO BUY
 PINTEREST.
 ONCE YOU START GETTING REAL GOOD
 COMPANIES -- PINTEREST IS NOT A
 BAD COMPANY.
 IF YOU CAN STOMACH IT, YOU CAN
 BUY FACEBOOK
 ON THE DAY LIKE TODAY, PEOPLE
 REALIZE, I GOT TO SELL MORE,
 PINTEREST IS OPENING UP HIGHER
 THAN I THOUGHT
 PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE $16
 TO $17.
 THE INITIAL PROJECTED RANGE,
 $15 TO $17
 WE SHOULD WARN INVESTORS, IT IS
 A DUAL CLASS STRUCTURE
 YOU'RE GOING TO BUY CLASS A,
 CLASS B HAS 20 VOTES A SHARE
 I KNOW.
 IT DOES SUNSET WITH THE
 EXECUTIVES LEADING THE COMPANY,
 WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN LYFT,
 WHICH DIDN'T HAVE THAT
 PROVISION.
 IT IS A GOOD POINT, CARL
 THESE GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS ARE
 IMPORTANT OR AT LEAST THEY DON'T
 SEEM TO AFFECT THE WAY --
 THEY DON'T.
 AND LET'S SEE, IN TERMS OF WHAT
 ELSE IS BEING SOLD, HEALTH CARE.
 THEY CAN'T RALLY

 EVERYBODY IS SO AFRAID WE'RE
 GOING TO GET MEDICARE FOR ALL.
 AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES.

 THAT AND THE THOUGHT IF YOU
 WERE TRULY WORRIED ABOUT A TRADE
 WAR OR MUELLER, YOU WERE HIDING
 IN SOME OF THESE DEFENSIVE NAMES
 AND NOW THERE IS NO REASON TO --
 LET'S SELL -- 8C.
 UNITED HEALTH IS HOLDING ITS
 OWN.
 UP THREE AT ONE POINT
 I'M USING MERCK AS THE TELL.
 THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL.
 MERCK IS JUST -- FROM 83 TO 72,
 AND MERCK IS JUST KILLING
 BRISTOL.
 AND OPDIVO, BRISTOL, THESE ARE
 MAJOR SHIFTS OUT OF MERCK INTO
 THE UNITED TECHNOLOGIES.
 YOU TWEETED A MOMENT AGO, THE
 GAINER, TOP THREE GAINERS ON THE
 S&P ARE MACRO NAMES.
 UNITED RENTALS, SNAP-ON, UNP.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE SHORT
 SNAP-ON, THOUGHT THEY WOULD
 MISS
 LILLY GOES DOWN AGAIN.
 URI, FANTASTIC NUMBERS
 UNION PACIFIC, I'M GLAD YOU
 HAVE -- YOU CAN ASK HIM, ISN'T
 THE COUNTRY DOING MUCH BETTER
 AND HE MAY SAY, LOOK, SOME OF
 THIS WAS BECAUSE WE HAD THE
 WEST/EAST CHINA TRYING TO FILL
 UP THE PIPE.
 MOST OF IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE
 STRONG CATEGORIES ACROSS THE
 BOARD.
 AND, AGAIN, THE RESILIENCE OF
 OUR ECONOMY VERSUS THE EUROPEAN
 PMIs
 APRIL, 47.8.
 PRIOR WAS 47.5
 VERY LITTLE --
 SPAIN IS GOING TO COME OUT
 AHEAD IN THIS PERIOD
 AND A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE
 THEY HAVE A STABLE POLITICAL
 SYSTEM AND GREAT BANKING SYSTEM.
 AND SPAIN
 VERSUS GERMANY, THE BANKING
 SYSTEM, EVERY DAY YOU HEAR
 COMMERCE, DEUTSCHE THIS,
 DEUTSCHE THAT.
 I WAS WITH AN EXECUTIVE AT A
 COMPANY THAT DOES A GREAT DEAL
 OF BUSINESS IN EUROPE, AND IT IS
 THE SAME REFRAIN, THINGS ARE
 SLOW
 SLOW.

 PEPSICO HAD A GOOD QUARTER.
 THERE YOU GO

 PEPSICO.
 JUDY HAWN, CREDIT SUISSE, THEY
 BET AGAINST --
 YOU CAN'T CAN EXPECT REAL
 GROWTH OUT OF EUROPE, EVEN
 GERMANY, TALKING NEGATIVE RATES.
 OTHER THAN LAMBORGHINI,
 BUILDING FIVE A DAY.
 THEIR CAR REGISTRATIONS ARE
 DOWN SEVEN MONTHS IN A ROW.
 YOU CAN'T GET ONE
 YOU CAN THANK HEAVENS YOU CAN'T.
 MY WIFE WAS INTERESTED AFTER
 GOING 180 MILES ON A SIDE
 STREET
 WE OUGHT TO GET ONE OF THESE
 I SAID IT IS NOT LIKE THAT
 WE HAVE A LOT OF HOUSES.
 IT IS NOT LIKE, DON'T BE DAVID
 FABER ON ME.
 DON'T BUY A $40,000 CAR.
 I LIVED IN MY CAR.
 I'M NOT GOING TO PAY THE PRICE
 OF A HOUSE.
 WITH YOUR CORDUROY SUIT AND

 CORDUROY SUIT.
 WHAT DO YOU GOT TONIGHT
 YOU GOT YOUR PICK OF TOPICS?
 5 BELOW IS A COMPANY THAT
 MAKES -- YOU KNOW IT MAKES COLD
 APPAREL, RIGHT
 RIGHT
 NO, IT IS FIVE TRINKETS
 GO TO 5.50 BECAUSE OF THE
 TARIFFS.
 REI IS THE PLACE TO GO FOR COLD
 EQUIPMENT.
 I'M AWARE OF REI.
 EIGHTH IN MARKET, WHERE MY
 MOM SOLD LINGERIE WHEN SHE WAS A
 YOUNG LADY.
 THEY KNEW TEXTILES.
 MY DAD SOLD GABERDINE

 I SAID, DAD, THEY'RE CALLED

 ENTERPRISE PAYING FOR THIS
 COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM.
 GOT A NUMBER OF INTERESTING
 PARTNERSHIPS, OF COURSE, WITH
 RESELLERS, ALSO INTEGRATIONS
 WITH THE LIKES OF SAY, RING
 CENTRAL.
 THEY HAVE MANAGED TO BOTH DO
 THIS EXPLOSIVE GROWTH, BUT THEN
 ALSO PROFITABILITY AT THE SAME
 TIME
 FOR EXAMPLE, RING CENTRAL HAS
 BEEN PUBLIC FOR A LONG TIME.
 DOESN'T HAVE EVEN THAT LEVEL OF
 PROFITABILITY.
 SO RIGHT NOW I THINK WHEN THERE
 ARE A NUMBER OF INVESTORS WHO
 ARE BOTH INTERESTING EXPLOSIVE
 GROWTH AND PERHAPS AS WE SAW
 WITH LYFT, WARY ABOUT LOSSES,
 ZOOM HAS A STORY THAT FITS VERY
 COMFORTABLY RIGHT IN THE SWEET
 SPOT OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS,
 GUYS
 YEAH, OF COURSE, NOW YOU GET
 REPORTS, I BELIEVE RICOED
 YESTERDAY THAT MICROSOFT
 APPROACHED THE COMPANY ABOUT
 ACQUIRING IT IN THE PAST
 DO YOU THINK THAT'S ADDED TO
 SOME OF THE INVESTOR EXCITEMENT
 HERE
 I WOULDN'T DOUBT IT
 YOU TAKE A LOOK AT GARDENER'S
 MAGIC QUADRANT, A RESEARCH
 OUTFIT THAT IS VERY DEEPLY
 EMBEDDED IN THE ENTERPRISE AND
 THEY HAVE THIS WAY OF MEASURING
 BOTH HOW CAPABLE IT IS IN TERMS
 OF DELIVERING TECHNOLOGY AND HOW
 VISIONARY IS IT IN DELIVERING
 TECHNOLOGY
 YOU WANT TO BE ON THE UPPER
 RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THAT
 QUADRANT, WELL, ZOOM IS THERE.
 EVEN AS A SMALL COMPANY, UP
 THERE WITH CISCO, WITH
 MICROSOFT.
 THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF NAMES YOU
 WOULD EXPECT TO BE TAKING A
 CLOSE LOOK AT ZOOM BOTH IN THE
 PAST, PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE.
 THE PRICE KEEPS GOING UP, FAIR
 TO SAY
 JON, THANK YOU.
 JON GOING TO BE CONTINUING HIS
 COVERAGE OF THAT ZOOM IPO,
 SPEAKING TO THE CEO ONCE THAT
 STOCK BEGINS TO TRADE.
 HERE AT THE NEW YORK STOCK
 EXCHANGE, WE'RE AWAITING FOR
 ZOOM AND PINTEREST RIGHT BEHIND
 ME HERE IN TERMS OF THE PIECE
 YOU HEARD FROM BOB PISANI,
 $22.50 TO $23.50
 LET'S TALC MORE ABOUT THE PUBLIC
 L
 LISTINGS
 WE'RE JOINED BY CAMERON ANSARI,
 FORMER HEAD OF CORPORATE
 DEVELOPMENT AND STRATEGY AT
 PINTEREST AND EARLY UBER
 INVESTOR VICTOR ORLOFSKY
 CAMERON, DO YOU OWN ANY STOCK,
 BY THE WAY
 I DO.
 EXCITING DAY FOR YOU.
 MY CO-WORKERS HERE, LIKE A
 TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.
 ONCE WE GET PAST DAY ONE AND
 THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT, AND
 WE'LL SEE WHERE THE STOCK OPENS,
 HOW DO YOU BELIEVE INVESTORS ARE
 BEST SERVED MEASURING THE
 PROGRESS OF THIS COMPANY
 IMETRICS.
 WITH PINTEREST IN PARTICULAR,
 I THINK MAU TELLS PART OF THE
 STORY.
 I THINK ENGAGEMENT AND THE USES
 OF THE PLATFORM WHICH ARE REALLY
 FOR PEOPLE TO FIND INSPIRATION
 AND THINK ABOUT COMMERCIAL
 INTENT, PRODUCT ZOFRY, THINGS OF
 THAT NATURE, DIFFERENT THAN
 OTHER PLATFORMS OUT THERE THAT
 ARE PURELY AN MAU FOCUSED STORY.
 YOU CAN LOOK AT PINTEREST AND
 THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH ARE THEY
 GENERATING PERUSER, WHICH IS OUR
 AVERAGE, THAT METRIC WILL GO UP
 OVER TIME AS THEY GET MORE
 MATURE.
 AND ENGAGEMENT.
 YOU LOOK AT THE VALUATION TODAY,
 YOU WERE THERE UNTIL 2017,
 TOWARDS ONE OF THE LAST ROUNDS,
 IT LOOKS LIKE THE MARKET CAP
 WILL EXCEED THE LAST ROUND
 IS THAT IN YOUR EVALUATION
 SOMETHINGING THAT SHOULD BE THE
 CASE
 I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE
 VALUATION, THE MARKET WILL DO
 WHAT IT DOES
 IT HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE
 THIS MORNING
 WE LOOK AT IN SIX MONTHS WHEN
 ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM, THE
 LOCKUP COMES UP AND THE
 INVESTORS AND INSIDERS CAN DO
 SOMETHING WITH THEIR SHARES AND
 WHERE THE STOCK IS TRADING THEN.
 TODAY, A GREAT MOMENT FOR THE
 COMPANY.
 THE VALUATION WILL --
 YOU MENTIONED LOCKUP.
 YOU ANTICIPATE YOU'LL SELL SOME
 SHARES WHEN THE LOCKUP COMES
 WE'LL SEE.
 I ASSUME IT WAS AN IMPORTANT
 PART OF YOUR COMPENSATION.
 I THINK FOR A LOT OF FOLKS,
 IT IS A BIG EVENT, A NICE
 MOMENT
 SEEING EVERYONE HERE IS
 EXCITING, I THINK.
 VICTOR, IT IS A TALE OF TWO
 TECH UNICORNS TODAY.
 ONE AT THE NASDAQ, MORE
 ENTERPRISE FACING AND WILL BE
 VALUED AT ALMOST $10 BILLION
 BASED ON THE IPO SHARE PRICE
 LAST NIGHT
 THE OTHER HERE AT THE STOCK
 EXCHANGE, MORE CONSUMER FACING,
 PINTEREST.
 ALSO VALUED AROUND $10 BILLION
 IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
 WITH TECH IPO PERFORMANCE SO FAR
 THIS YEAR, AND HOW INVESTORS ARE
 APPROACHING THESE TWO DIFFERENT
 PIECES, HOW WOULD YOU EXPECT
 THIS TO SHAKE OUT TODAY AND
 BEYOND
 OKAY, YEAH, HI.
 YEAH, FIRST OF ALL, I JUST
 WANTED TO -- I THINK THEY DID AN
 EXCITING JOB
 AND EVENTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT
 PINTEREST, AND ZOOM, YOU
 WOULDN'T FIND THEM TO BE
 SOMETHING SIMILAR, BUT I DO FIND
 A LOT OF SIMILARITY IN BOTH
 COMPANIES.
 THEY BOTH STARTED IN 2011.
 AND THEY CHANGED THE WORLD OF
 COMMUNICATION.
 SO PINTEREST CHANGED THE WORLD,
 WE COMMUNICATE WITH BRANDS
 AND ZOOM HAS CHANGED THE WORLD
 WE COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE
 AND I THINK THAT'S A LOT TO SAY
 ABOUT THE USER EXPERIENCE,
 RIGHT?
 SO PINTEREST GIVES A UNIQUE USER
 EXPERIENCE TO CHOOSE THE PRODUCT
 AND TO PIN THE PRODUCT AND BUY
 THE PRODUCT.
 ZOOM IS REALLY EXCITING TO
 COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE.
 SO YESTERDAY WE HAD A BET WITH
 MY WIFE, WHERE TO INVEST TO.
 SHE IS A FREQUENT USER OF
 PINTEREST.
 SHE'S BUYING THROUGH PINTEREST A
 LOT AND SHE'S LIKE USING IT ON
 AN EVERYDAY BASIS.
 SO THAT'S WHAT I DO WITH ZOOM.
 I SPEND MY TIME IN THE
 CONFERENCE ROOM AND AMONG ALL
 COMPANIES I TRY, ZOOM IS FAR THE
 BEST IN MY MIND IN TERMS OF
 COMMUNICATION.
 SO INVEST EACH IN THE COMPANY,
 ME AND MY WIFE, IN THE COMPANIES
 WE LIKE THE MOST
 BUT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THING,
 RIGHT.
 WHY THIS COMPANY DEFERS FROM
 OTHERS IS BECAUSE THEY CHANGED
 THE USER EXPERIENCE, THEY
 CHANGED THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT
 THE PRODUCTS, AND THE
 COMMUNICATION, RIGHT
 SO I AM EXCITED ABOUT HAVING
 THIS IPOs.
 WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE
 TEAMS, BOTH TEAMS, THEY WILL
 CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND THERE
 IS TONS OF TALENT IN BOTH
 COMPANIES.
 SO I WOULD ASSUME THEY WILL BE
 DOING REALLY GREAT THROUGHOUT
 AND THEY WILL BECOME A GREAT
 COMPETITOR TO BOTH MEN
 ZOOM AND FACEBOOK, TWITTER,
 PINTEREST.
 OKAY.
 CAMERON, I FEEL LIKE I'LL BE
 ASKING THIS QUESTION A LOT TODAY
 AND BEYOND
 AS SOMEBODY WHO USED TO WORK AT
 PINTEREST AND SO FOCUSED NOW IN
 YOUR CURRENT ROLE ON FINANCIAL
 TECHNOLOGIES, THE OPPORTUNITY IN
 TERMS OF MONETIZING THOSE
 MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS ON THE
 PLATFORM, SHOPPING, THE
 POSSIBILITIES THERE, PAYMENTS,
 ET CETERA, HOW WOULD YOU EXPECT
 THAT TO PLAY OUT.
 I THINK THE BIG THING PEOPLE
 THINK ABOUT IS E-COMMERCE.
 FOLKS ARE COMING TO PINTEREST
 WITH AN INTENT TO SHOP AND FIND
 PRODUCTS TO POTENTIALLY TRANSACT
 ON EVENTUALLY.
 HOW IS THIS SITE GOING TO
 LEVERAGE THAT AND HAVE LINKS TO
 RETAILERS, YOU HAVE SOMETHING
 CALLED PRODUCT PINS WHICH HAVE
 THE INVENTORY OF ITEMS, THE
 PRICING, THE RETAILER WHICH YOU
 CAN BUY AND CLICK THROUGH AND
 SHOP WITH THAT RETAILER.
 TODAY THAT'S IN THE EARLY
 STAGES
 IT IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY
 THERE.
 BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND SOMETHING
 LIKE 94% OF THE REVENUE IS
 DOM
 DOMESTIC
 A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY IN WESTERN
 EUROPE AND SOME OF THE MARKETS
 IN WHICH PINTEREST HAS A LOT OF
 USERS TO MONETIZE THOSE IN
 ADVERTISING AND POTENTIAL
 E-COMMERCE.
 WE HAD A DISCUSSION EARLIER
 ABOUT THE WAY PINTEREST IS
 DIFFERENT FROM OTHER NAMES THAN
 SOCIAL
 LIABILITIES TO COME FROM BEING
 IN SOCIAL.
 ARE THERE GUARDRAILS AGAINST
 OFFENSIVE CONTENT?
 HOW DOES THAT EVEN PLAY IN
 SOMETHING LIKE PINTEREST
 IT ALWAYS HAD THIS DEEP
 BELIEF TO KEEP THE SITE SUPER
 BRAND SAFE
 I SEE THE GUY BEHIND ME WHO LED
 THAT DEPARTMENT.
 SO IT WAS BOTH MAN AND MACHINE,
 WHOLE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT THAT
 MONITORS CONTENT AS WELL AS WE
 HAVE ALGORITHMS AND MACHINE
 LEARNING THAT DETECTS THINGS
 THAT SHOULDN'T BE ON THERE AND
 THE WHOLE GOAL IS TO KEEP THE
 SITE A PLACE THAT FEELS
 FRIENDLY, WARM, INVITING TO
 BRANDS AND TO USERS AND DOESN'T
 HAVE HATE SPEECH OR
 INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT, THINGS
 LIKE THAT.
 THAT'S A MAJOR PRIORITY.
 IT IS THE DISNEY OF CONSUMER
 INTERNET SITES
 YOU RAN CORPORATE
 DEVELOPMENT, YOU OVERSAW A LOT
 OF DEALS, THEY'LL HAVE A
 CURRENCY TO USE NOW.
 IS THERE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY,
 DO YOU THINK, FOR PINTEREST IN
 TERMS OF FURTHER CONSOLIDATION
 OR OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT BE
 OUT THERE THEY WOULD WANT?
 SURE, LOOK, ONE THING YOU SAW
 LAST YEAR, SPOTIFY WENT PUBLIC,
 THEY HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE M&A
 FIELD.
 WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE FOR THE PAST
 SEVERAL YEARS OF PINTEREST
 LARGELY SMALLER DEALS, SO ONCE
 THERE IS A PUBLIC CURRENCY YOU
 CAN USE AND A LOT OF CASH AS
 WELL-BEING RAISED IN THE IPO, I
 WOULD EXPECT YOU CAN SEE SOME
 DEALS IN THE FUTURE, ABSOLUTELY.
 WE'LL ASK BEN SILBERMANN AS
 WELL
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

 VIDEO IMAGES OF BEN SILBERMANN,
 CEO AND CO-FOUNDER OF PINTEREST.
 HE'LL JOIN US HERE AT POST NINE
 AS SOON AS PINTEREST BEGINS
 TRADING HERE AT THE NEW YORK
 STOCK EXCHANGE
 STOCKS WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE
 OF NEW RECORDS, HIGHS OF THE
 MORNING AS PINTEREST AND ZOOM
 HEADLINE A BIG DAY FOR PUBLIC
 DEBUTS AT THE NYSE AND UP TOWN
 AT THE NASDAQ.
 MIKE SANTOLI AND LESLIE PICKARD
 JOINING US NOW
 A BIG WEEK IN GENERAL SO FAR FOR
 2019 IN TERMS OF IPOs.
 IT IS
 IT IS A BULL MARKET, ACTING LIKE
 A BULL MARKET WITH HOPPED UP
 IPOs
 IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE OVERALL
 MARKET HAS FAVORED LATELY, IT IS
 GROWTH OVER VALUE, IT IS TECH
 OVER MOST OTHER INDUSTRIES, AND
 IF AN INVESTOR WHO HAS BOTH OF
 THOSE BOXES CHECKED OFF CAN GET
 A STOCK THAT IS NOT IN HIS OR
 HER INDEX AND CAN HAVE THE
 CHANCE TO OUTPERFORM, A NEW NAME
 THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A
 WHILE, I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
 SEEING A RELATIVELY STRONG
 INITIAL UPTICK FOR THESE IDEAS.
 PINTEREST INDICATED TO OPEN
 UP 20% HIGHER TODAY, ZOOM UP
 MORE THAN 30% HIGHER
 IF YOU CAN GET THAT MUCH ALPHA
 IN ONE DAY, THAT'S KIND OF THE
 MIND SET OF HEDGE FUNDS THAT BUY
 INTO THESE THINGS.
 NOW, THE CHALLENGE IS HOW LONG
 THEY HOLD ON TO IT AFTER THEY
 BUY.
 IF YOU GET TOO MUCH FLIPPING ON
 DAY ONE, YOU CAN SEE A SITUATION
 WHERE THE STOCK STARTS TO
 PRECIPITOUSLY DECLINE.
 WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW WITH
 LYFT
 YOU WERE FOLLOWING THAT
 SITUATION.
 IS THAT A CONVERSATION THAT IS
 BEING HAD ACTIVELY
 I IMAGINE IT IS WITH BANKERS AND
 OTHER FOLKS INVOLVED IN THE IPOs
 YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO.
 THAT'S A HUGE COMPONENT OF
 THE BOOK BUILDING PROCESS.
 THEY TAKE A SURVEY OF ALL OF THE
 INVESTORS AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE
 WILLING TO PAY FOR A CERTAIN
 AMOUNT OF SHARES
 INVESTORS WILL ALWAYS
 OVERPROMISE ON WHAT THEY WANT TO
 BUY AND AT WHAT PRICE.
 BECAUSE THEY EXPECT TO GET LESS
 ALLOCATION THAN WHAT THEY PUT IN
 FOR.
 THAT SAID, IF YOU'RE THE
 UNDERWRITER FOR ANY IPO, YOU
 WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE --
 YOU'RE CREATING A GOOD TRADE-OFF
 BETWEEN PRICE AND LONGEVITY WITH
 THESE INVESTORS.
 MEANING THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
 JUST STRETCH FOR THE HIGHEST
 PRICE IF YOU GET A BOOK OF
 INVESTORS THAT ARE PROBABLY
 GOING TO FLIP ON THE FIRST DAY.
 MIKE, HOW MUCH ARE WE WORRIED
 ABOUT THIS TAKING ALL THE OXYGEN
 OUT OF THE ROOM AS FAR AS THE
 BROADER MARKET IS CONCERNED?
 I THINK AT THIS STAGE, NOT
 TERRIBLY WORRIED
 IF ONE THING HAS BEEN ABSENT IN
 THE LAST FEW YEARS, IT HAS BEEN
 A LOT OF NEW STOCK OFFERINGS, A
 LOT OF NEW EQUITY SUPPLY
 THERE HAS BEEN MORE STOCK
 BROUGHT BACK OUT OF THE MARKET
 THAN ISSUED TO THE TUNE OF HALF
 A TRILLION A YEAR OVER THE PAST
 FEW YEARS.
 THESE AMOUNTS THAT ARE BEING
 SOLD CERTAINLY $2 BILLION HERE
 OR THERE, EVEN IF IT IS 10 FOR
 SOME OF THE BIGGER DEALS, THAT
 IS NOT JUST GOING TO TIP THE
 SUPPLY AND DEMAND BALANCE F YOU
 GET OVERAGGRESSIVE ON THE
 VALUATIONS, IF YOU HAVE THAT
 COLLISION OF PRIVATE COMPANY
 VENTURE CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY
 MATH WITH PUBLIC MARKET, YOU
 KNOW, SCRUTINY AND DISCIPLINE
 AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANT TO PAY
 UP FOR, THAT COULD CREATE A
 LITTLE BIT OF STATIC IN HERE
 I THINK A BIGGER ISSUE WITH
 LYFT
 YOU NEEDED TO FIND A PRICE AT
 WHICH INVESTORS ARE WILLING TO
 SIGN UP FOR YEARS AND YEARS OF
 CAPITAL BURN AND MAYBE SOME DAY
 DOWN THE ROAD AT THE HORIZON
 HAVE A PROFITABLE COMPANY.
 YOU'VE REMINDED VIEWERS, BUT
 PINTEREST'S LOSSES ARE MILD
 COMPARED TO LYFT.
 $63 MILLION FOR THEM.
 LYFT WAS CLOSE TO A BILLION
 DOLLARS.
 UBER, THEIR OPERATING LOSSES ARE
 $3 BILLION, THREE TIMES WHAT WE
 SAW WITH LYFT.
 AT LEAST IN THIS MARKET, IN
 2018, STOCKS FOR COMPANIES THAT
 HAD NO EARNINGS PERFORMED DOUBLE
 AS WELL ON THE FIRST DAY OF
 TRADING, UP ABOUT 20% COMPARED
 TO COMPANIES THAT DEBUTED
 WITHOUT -- OR WITH EARNINGS.
 YEAH.
 GUYS, THANKS FOR JOINING US.
 ZOOM IPO IS ZOOMING HIGHER, THAT
 INDICATED PRICE OF $52 NOW
 VERSUS $36
 ONE TO WATCH AS THIS MORNING
 UNFOLDS.
 SPEAKING OF THE IPOs, WE'LL
 BE JOINED BY BOTH CEOs
 SEPARATELY AFTER THE STOCKS
 BEGIN TRADING.

 FOCUS AGAIN THIS IDEA THAT THESE
 TRADES ARE BIG AND WHILE WE ARE
 TRACKING THE INDIVIDUAL STOCK
 MOVES FOR BIG STOCKS LIKE THIS,
 THE FACEBOOKS, THE ALPHABETS,
 AMAZONS AND NETFLIXES OF THE
 WORLD, MANY INVESTORS USE
 EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS TO GAIN
 EXPOSURE TO BASKETS OF THE
 INTERNET RELATED ISSUES.
 SECTOR-BASED FUNDS FOCUSED ON

 HOLD MANY OF THESE NAMES, THERE
 ARE OTHER FUNDS THAT ARE MORE

 US IS ONE OF PINTEREST'S MOST
 FOLLOWED USERS, LOS ANGELES
 BASED DESIGNER JOEY CHOI
 THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY
 APPRECIATE IT.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME
 HOW LONG HAS IT TAKEN YOU
 ASSEMBLE THAT MANY FOLLOWERS
 I'VE BEEN ON PINTEREST FOR
 NINE YEARS SINCE THE VERY
 BEGINNING.
 AND THE VERY BEGINNING I HAD A
 SOCIAL PRESENCE THROUGH BLOG AND
 EARLY SOCIAL MEDIA DAYS.
 SO OUR FOLLOWING BEGAN TO GROW
 AS PINTEREST BECAME MORE USED
 WIDELY.
 YOU WERE ABLE TO GROW YOUR
 DESIGN BUSINESS AND YOU WORKED
 WITH COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT,
 TARGET, URBAN.
 CAN YOU CHARACTERIZE THEIR LEVEL
 OF INTEREST IN YOU BECAUSE OF
 WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON PINTEREST
 THESE DAYS BRANDS ARE LOOKING
 TO WORK WITH INFLUENCERS WHO CAN
 REACH PEOPLE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT
 WAYS
 BECAUSE WE HAVE PRODUCTS, A
 LIFESTYLE BRAND, PEOPLE WANT TO
 SEE HOW YOU CAN BE INSPIRED BY
 THOSE THINGS
 WE CAN CREATE SOMETHING AND
 PINTEREST ALLOWS US TO DO THAT
 BY CREATING CONTENT AND SHARING
 IT WITH ALL OF OUR FOLLOWERS
 JOY, I KNOW YOU HAVE
 FOOTPRINTS ON TWITTER AND
 INSTAGRAM.
 IT LOOKS LIKE THE BIGGEST
 INFLUENCE YOU HAVE IS ON
 PINTEREST.
 WHY DO YOU LIKE THIS PLATFORM OR
 WHY DO YOU PREFER TO USE THIS
 PLATFORM MORE THAN THE OTHERS?
 WELL, PINTEREST IS SUCH A
 GREAT TOOL FOR ME FOR MY TEAM
 WHEN WE'RE SHARING IDEAS AND
 TRYING TO GET INSPIRATION, AND
 ALSO FOR ME, SO NATURAL TO SEE
 THINGS THAT I WANT TO DO,
 RECIPES, HOME DECOR IDEAS AND
 MAYBE SOMETHING I WANT TO
 APPROACH IN THE FUTURE, SO THE
 PEOPLE FOLLOWING ALONG ARE
 LOOKING TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH
 THAT AESTHETIC AND INSPIRE THEM.
 ME CURE RATING MY OWN FEED HELPS
 THEM TO CREATE EXPERIENCES THEY
 WANT TO HAVE TOO IN THEIR OWN
 LIVES.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK THE COMPANY
 NEEDS TO DO NEXT AS A PUBLIC
 COMPANY TO ENSURE THAT ITS
 GROWTH WILL CONTINUE
 I THINK THE AMAZING THING
 ABOUT PINTEREST GOING PUBLIC IS
 THE ABILITY TO GROW AND OFFER
 MORE CUSTOMIZATION FOR ITS
 USERS.
 THEY HAVE ADDED SO MANY FEATURES
 OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS, I'VE
 BEEN SO THRILLED TO GO ALONG
 WITH THAT AND SEE IT AS IT IS
 GROWING.
 I THINK IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO
 MORE THINGS FOR THEIR USERS AND
 PUT A USE TO IT, CUSTOMIZE PAGES
 AND SETTINGS MORE TO THE WAY
 PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO.
 JOY, I WAS GOING TO DIG INTO
 THAT A BIT MORE AND SEE IF THERE
 IS ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SEE
 BUILT OUT FURTHER AND IMPROVED
 UPON.
 YEAH, I MEAN, I WOULD LOVE TO
 BE ABLE TO LOOK AT MY PAGE AND
 BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE
 CUSTOM
 CUSTOM HEADERS OR JUST THE WAY
 THAT IT LOOKS, CHANGE SOME
 COLORS AROUND.
 SOMETHING I CAN MAKE IT FEEL A
 LITTLE CLOSER TO MY BRAND WHEN
 PEOPLE ARE COMING TO IT AND
 TIEING IT BACK TO MY MAIN
 WEBSITE AS WELL.
 WE KNOW THE DEMOGRAPHIC SKEWS
 HEAVILY FEMALE
 I USED TO HEAR NUMBERS LIKE 90%,
 BUT I'M TOLD LATELY MORE LIKE

 HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE IT TO PEOPLE
 WHO PROBABLY SAY I WOULD NEVER
 EVEN BE ON THIS PLATFORM,
 DOESN'T SOUND THAT INTERESTING
 TO ME.
 HOW DO YOU EVANGELIZE FOR IT
 I WOULD SAY 15 YEARS AGO OR
 SO, WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY
 BUSINESS, I WAS RIPPING UP PAGES
 OF MAGAZINES AND PUTTING IT INTO
 A BINDER AN THAT'S HOW I SAVED
 MY INSPIRATION, PINTEREST IS THE
 ONLINE VERSION OF THAT
 TO ME IT IS AN ONLINE SCRAPBOOK
 AND THE PLACE WHERE I CAN SAVE
 THINS I'M INTERESTED, THE GOALS
 I HAVE, IDEAS I WANT TO FOLLOW
 AND THINGS I WANT TO DO EITHER
 NOW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE T
 MAKES IT EASIER TO GET TO IT
 ONLINE.
 YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BUILDING
 OUT YOUR PROFILE AND YOUR
 BUSINESS ON PINTEREST.
 WOULD YOU INVEST IN THE STOCK?
 YEAH, I WOULD INVEST IN THE
 STOCK.
 ARE YOU GOING TO?
 I WILL MAKE DECISIONS VERY
 SOON
 BUT I HOPE TO.
 THANK YOU.
 REALLY QUICK, WE MENTIONED
 NEARLY 13 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON
 PINTEREST, ABOUT HALF A MILLION
 ON INSTAGRAM
 AND I THINK PROBABLY IN THE
 80,000 RANGE ON TWITTER.
 ARE YOU INTERESTED IN TRYING TO
 GROW THOSE OR ARE YOU PUTTING
 ALL YOUR RESOURCES INTO GROWING
 YOUR PINTEREST FOLLOWING
 WE'RE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON PIVOT
 REST AND INSTAGRAM AS A
 VISUAL-BASED COMPANY
 FOR ME IT MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS
 ON THE PLATFORMS THAT ARE
 VISUALLY BASED
 THOSE ARE THE MOST VISUALLY
 BASED AND THE PLACE WE CAN REACH
 OUR AUDIENCE THE STRONGEST.
 CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL YOUR
 SUCCESS.
 AND OBVIOUSLY IT IS A HUGE
 TESTIMONIAL TO THE POWER OF THE
 PLATFORM, WHICH WE'RE WATCHING
 CLOSELY TODAY.
 JOY, THANK YOU
 JOY CHO JOINING US TODAY FROM O
 JOY.

 N'GOWAY.IS
    So...how many credit cards
         did I have after         business school?
               Six?
       Yeah...that interest         rate was crazy.
     Good thing I got a loan     to pay them off faster.
 And right before I got engaged.
   But now that I'm debt-free,
    I can actually contribute         to the wedding.
      And go on a honeymoon.
    You know... out of state.

 ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST ROLLS SAYS THE MARKET RALLY HAS
 A LONG WAY TO GO
 FIND OUT WHAT HE'S WATCHING ON
 TRADINGNATION.CNBC.COM
 MORE "SQUAWK ON THE STREET"
 COMING UP.
 TWO BIG PUBLIC DEBUTS THIS MORNING.
 ONE, OF COURSE, PINTEREST HERE
 AT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE
 WE ALSO HAVE ZOOM, THE VIDEO
 CONFERENCING COMPANY, IT IS NOW
 SHOWING AN INDICATION TO OPEN AT

 IT KEEPS MOVING HIGHER
 THIS AFTER PRICING AT $36 A
 SHARE.
 LET'S CHECK IN WITH BERTHA
 COOMBS, LIVE AT THE NASDAQ
 MARKET SITE WITH MORE.
 BERTHA
 RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL VERY
 MUCH IN THE INITIAL STAGES HERE.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO PAIR OFF
 BUYER AND SELLERS HERE IN THE
 IPO.
 THEY PAIRED OFF ABOUT 1.5
 MILLION SHARES AT THIS POINT
 STILL NO REAL INDICATION EXACTLY
 WHEN WE'LL BE OPENING HERE
 JPMORGAN AND GOLDMAN SACHS ARE
 THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
 THIS SAY HIGHLY ANTICIPATED IPO,
 ONE OF THOSE TECH UNICORNS THAT
 IS ACTUALLY PROFITABLE
 ZOOM PROVIDES VIDEO
 CONFERENCING, IT COMPETES WITH
 THE LIKES OF CISCO AND
 MICROSOFT'S SKYPE FOR BUSINESS
 HOWEVER, IT IS ONE OF THOSE THAT
 A LOT OF FOLKS ON WALL STREET
 AND IN SILICON VALLEY HAVE BEEN
 WATCHING, REPORTING THAT
 MICROSOFT AS RECENTLY AS EARLIER
 THIS YEAR TRIED TO BUY ZOOM, BUT
 THEY DECIDED TO GO PUBLIC
 INSTEAD.
 BUT THEY ARE ALSO GETTING SOME
 BIG BACKING IN THIS IPO.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THE
 OPENING TRADES HERE.
 AMONG THE INVESTORS HERE, AT THE
 IPO PRICE OF $36 A SHARE IS
 SALES FORCE.COM.
 SALES FORCE VENTURE WILL BE
 TAKING $100 MILLION STAKE IN THE
 COMPANY, WHICH IS PROFITABLE AND
 WITH THAT, THEY ARE PRICING
 HERE, THEY'RE GOING TO BE WELL
 ABOVE $10 BILLION IN TERMS OF
 VALUATION.
 EVEN JUST AT THE PRICING OF $36
 A SHARE, IT WAS PUTTING THEM AT
 ABOUT 28 TO 30 TIMES THEIR
 REVENUES
 BUT THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS
 GROWING VERY QUICKLY
 IT HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN
 TERMS OF EARNINGS AND REVENUE
 OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
 AND, AGAIN, IT IS PROFITABLE
 NOT THE ONLY IPO HERE TODAY.
 I WANT TO MENTION WE ALSO HAVE
 AN IPO THAT ALSO UPSIZED ITS
 OFFERING AND ALSO PRICED ABOVE
 THE RANGE.
 THAT IS GREEN LANE HOLDINGS.
 THIS IS A VAPING DISTRIBUTOR,
 THEY DISTRIBUTE CANNABIS
 SUPPLIES TO NEARLY 10,000 RETAIL
 ESTABLISHMENTS IN NORTH AMERICA.
 THEY PRICED $17 A SHARE.
 OPENED AT ABOUT $29 A SHARE.
 AND IS DOING VERY WELL HERE IN
 ITS DEBUT.
 BUT ALL EYES AT THE MOMENT HERE
 ON ZOOM, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP
 MONITORING THE SITUATION FOR YOU
 AND GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHEN WE
 THINK WE MIGHT GET THAT OPENING
 TRADE.
 BACK OVER TO YOU, DAVID.
 BERTHA, THANK YOU
 I'M SURE WE'LL SEE YOU MORE AS
 ALL OF THIS UNFOLDS THIS
 MORNING.
 UNION PACIFIC SURGING, UP MORE
 THAN 4% NOW, TRADING AS AN ALL
 TIME HIGH ON TODAY'S SESSION
 UNP CELEBRATING THE 150th
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE
 TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD
 COMPLETION, A ROUTE THAT THE
 COMPANY IS STILL USING TODAY
 JOINING US NOW ON OUR FIRST CNBC
 INTERVIEW, UNION PACIFIC
 CHAIRMAN AND CEO LANCE FRITZ
 LANCE, GREAT TO SEE YOU TODAY.
 I'M GOING TO JUMP RIGHT INTO IT
 HERE
 IN TERMS OF THOSE RECORD FIRST
 QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS, A LOT
 OF CATASTROPHIC AND REALLY
 DIFFICULT WEATHER THAT IMPACTED
 THE RAILROAD LAST QUARTER, LIKE
 MANY OTHER COMPANIES WE HAVE
 SEEN BEFORE.
 YOU SAID HERE IN THE RESULTS
 THAT THE UNIFIED PLAN 2020,
 WHICH IS THAT LONGER TERM
 STRATEGY, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
 PRECISION SCHEDULED RAILROADING
 HELPED CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK
 ALLOWING YOU TO CONTINUE TO
 NORMAL OPERATIONS.
 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS
 MORNING.
 THE WAY THE UNIFIED PLAN 2020
 HELPED US RECOVER QUICKLY IS
 THAT ESSENTIALLY IT REMOVED WORK
 FROM THE NETWORK, WE'RE TOUCHING
 CARS FEWER TIMES AND THAT GAVE
 US MORE CAPACITY IN OUR
 TERMINALS TO HANDLE A SURGE.
 AND WE DID ONE OTHER THING THAT
 I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF THE TEAM
 FOR THINKING OF AND THAT IS THE
 HARDEST PART OF THE NETWORK IS
 OUR MANIFEST PART OF THE
 NETWORK, SWITCHING CARS AND
 TERMINALS AND BUILDING TRAINS
 VERSUS OUR BULK PRODUCTS WHICH
 TEND TO BE UNIT TRAINS FROM
 ORIGIN TO DESTINATION.
 AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE FOCUSED
 ON RUNNING THE MANIFEST PART OF
 THE NETWORK COMPLETELY IN ITS
 ENTIRETY TO THE EXTENT WE COULD.
 AND AS A RESULT, THAT MOST
 DIFFICULT PART OF THE NETWORK
 WAS MAINTAINED THROUGH THE
 OUTAGE
 THE OUTAGE WAS EPIC FOR US
 WE HAD OUR EAST/WEST MAIN LINE
 SEVERED FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS, 13
 DAYS, AND AS FAR AS ANY OF US
 COULD TELL, THAT HASN'T HAPPENED
 AT LEAST AS FAR BACK AS WE CAN
 SEE, LET'S SAY 50 YEARS AGO.
 IT WAS AN EPIC, EPIC WEATHER
 ISSUE.
 WOW
 AND CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, ADDED
 TO A LOT OF NOISE IN TERMS OF
 DATA AND ECONOMIC METRICS WE
 KEEP EYE ON IN FIRST QUARTER
 GIVEN THE FACT THAT UNION
 PACIFIC TOUCHES JUST ABOUT EVERY
 TYPE OF GOOD IN SOME FORM OR
 FASHION, TO SOME EXTENT THAT IS
 MOVING AROUND THE U.S., WHAT IS
 YOUR TAKE MORE BROADLY ON THE
 STATE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY NOW?
 U.S. ECONOMY FEELS PRETTY
 GOOD TO US
 IF YOU LOOKED AT THE FIRST
 QUARTER, SO WE WERE DOWN 2% IN
 VOLUME, BUT THE WEATHER IMPACT
 ALONE WAS A HANDFUL OF
 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
 AND IF I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE
 QUARTER COULD HAVE BEEN, THE
 WEATHER IMPACTED DIRECTLY ARE
 ENERGY BUSINESS, IMPACTED OUR
 GREEN BUSINESS, IMPACTED SEVERAL
 OTHER COMMODITIES, ETHANOL, THE
 CAR LOAD BUSINESS TO A DEGREE.
 AS WE LOOK FORWARD IN THE
 ECONOMY, THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY
 CONTINUES TO FEEL PRETTY GOOD.
 THE GULF COAST INVESTMENT
 CONTINUES TO COME ONLINE
 WE SEE STRENGTH IN STEEL, WE SEE
 STRENGTH IN PLASTICS AND
 INDUSTRIAL, THE CONSTRUCTION
 PRODUCT MARKETS.
 AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY LOOKS LIKE
 SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BE
 SOMETHING LIKE 16.8 MILLION
 UNITS FOR THE YEAR
 THAT FEELS OKAY.
 OUR INTERMODAL PRODUCT BOTH
 INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC
 SHARES SOME PROMISE.
 A LITTLE BIT OF A HEAD WIND IN
 DOMESTIC INTERMODAL IN THAT
 TRUCKS ARE A LITTLE LOOSER, BUT
 OVERALL THE ECONOMY, PEOPLE
 CONSUMING THINGS, THAT FEELS
 PRETTY GOOD.
 I GUESS THE ONE QUESTION MARK WE
 HAVE IS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 AND ON THAT TOPIC, WE NEED
 CONGRESS TO RATIFY U.S. MCA AND
 CLOSE THE DEAL WITH CHINA.
 ONCE THOSE TWO THINGS ARE IN
 HAND, THE ECONOMY WILL FEEL
 PRETTY DARN GOOD TO US
 LANCE THAT WAS MY LAST
 QUESTION, YOU KNOW
 YOU DO HAVE SOME MACRO BEARS WHO
 CONTINUE TO POINT TO CAR LOADS
 YEAR ON YEAR
 WORRIES ABOUT PAPER AND
 CARDBOARD, WORRIES ABOUT
 TRUCKING AS YOU POINTED TO
 HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE THEM TO
 PROCESS SOME OF THE METRICS?
 YEAH, SO I THINK THE NUMBER
 ONE ISSUE FOR US IS OUR UNIFIED
 PLAN 2020 IN THE PSR
 IMPLEMENTATION IS CREATING A
 MORE RELIABLE CONSISTENT SERVICE
 PRODUCT.
 THERE IS DEMAND OUT THERE THAT
 IS NOT YET SHOWING ITSELF TO US
 AND WON'T UNTIL WE DEMONSTRATE
 THAT CONSISTENT RELIABLE
 SERVICE.
 AS WE DO THAT, I THINK THERE IS
 LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET
 FOR US NOT JUST IN TRUCK
 CONVERSION, INTO OUR DOMESTIC
 AND INTERMODAL PRODUCT, BUT THE
 CAR WORLD.
 IF I LOOK AT THE BROADER
 ECONOMY, CONSUMERS STILL FEEL
 PRETTY GOOD, THE JOB MARKET
 LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, CONTINUING TO
 CONSUME, THE INDUSTRIAL
 MARKETPLACE CONTINUES TO LOOK
 PRETTY GOOD.
 AND THE ONE AREA THAT WE JUST
 GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON AND GET
 RIGHT IS THE TRADE
 YEAH.
 TOPIC I'M SURE WE'LL BE SPEAKING
 MUCH MORE ABOUT IN THE COMING
 DAYS, COMING WEEKS AND COMING
 MONTHS
 LANCE FRITZ, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
 JOINING US TODAY ON THIS BUSY
 EARNINGS DAY
 SHARES OF UNION PACIFIC UP 4%
 RIGHT NOW.
 THANK YOU.
 WE CONTINUE TO TRACK THE TWO
 LARGE IPOs, ONE HERE, OF COURSE,
 THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE,
 PINTEREST, ANOTHER AT THE NASDAQ
 ZOOM, THE INDICATION FOR WHICH
 HAS BEEN MOVING UP UNTIL JUST
 MOMENTS AGO WHEN 60 SEEMS TO
 HAVE BEEN PERHAPS THE HEIGHT OF
 5950 NOW THE NEW INDICATION FOR
 THE VIDEO CONFERENCING COMPANY
 LESLIE PICKER COVERS CAPITAL
 MARKETS FOR US, JOINS US BACK
 HERE AT POST NINE.
 THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING CLOSER
 ON ZOOM.
 THIS IS ALSO, ACTUALLY, I SHOULD
 SAY PINTEREST BEHIND ME
 MAINTAINS SORT OF 23 TO 23.50
 FOR A BIT OF TIME AS THEY GET
 THE BOOK TOGETHER THERE AS WELL.
 THEY HAVE BEEN NARROWING THE
 RANGE, LOOKING LIKE IT COULD
 OPEN IN THE 23s.
 THAT WOULD IMPLY A POP OF
 UPWARDS OF 20%
 FOR ZOOM, IT IS LIKE ABOUT 60%
 AT THE OPEN.
 IF IT OPENS AT THAT LEVEL, WHICH
 IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD
 268 MILLION FULLY DILUTED
 SHARES OUTSTANDING
 YOU CAN DO THE MATH AT HOME IN
 TERMS OF 60 TIMES THAT NUMBER.
 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
 THE MARKET CAP BATTLE HERE
 BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE'LL BOTH BE
 VERY CLOSE IN TERMS OF OVERALL
 SIZE
 I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
 WERE EXPECTING WHEN THESE TWO
 COMPANIES WENT OUT AND STARTED
 MARKETING THEIR ROAD SHOWS
 BANKERS I SPOKE WITH SAID THEY
 DID EXPECT ZOOM TO BE SAID THEY
 DID EXPECT ZOOM TO BE A WINNER
 AND EXPECTED IT TO BE HOT
 REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY PRICED
 IT JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SO
 MUCH DEMAND CLAMORING FOR THIS
 STOCK.
 PINTEREST, INTERESTINGLY, CAME
 OUT WITH A CONSERVATIVE
 VALUATION.
 WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH SOME OF
 THE OTHER PUBLICLY TRADED PEERS
 IN SEARCH AND SOCIAL AS WELL AS
 E-COMMERCE IT ACTUALLY DID LOOK
 LIKE A PRETTY HIGH VALUATION AT
 LAST NIGHT'S PRICING OF $19 A
 SHARE.
 THAT IMPLIES AN ENTERPRISE VALUE
 TO FORWARD REVENUE RATIO OF
 ABOUT TEN TIMES, WHICH IS DOUBLE
 THAT OF A LOT OF THE BIG SOCIAL
 SEARCH E-COMMERCE COMPANIES THAT
 WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH.
 GIVEN THE FACT ESPECIALLY
 WITH A NAME LIKE ZOOM, THE
 MESSAGE HERE FOR RETAIL
 INVESTORS ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT
 WE DID SEE WITH LYFT
 IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
 A LOT OF TIMES THE CALCULUS IN
 PRICING THESE THINGS IS WHAT IS
 THE VARIABLE FOR RETAILER.
 IT'S A LOT HARDER TO BE ABLE TO
 PREDICT WHAT RETAIL IS GOING TO
 DO.
 WHEN YOU HAVE A NAME LIKE LYFT,
 PINTEREST, UBER, YOU CAN EXPECT
 THAT RETAIL WILL COME IN AROUND
 THE MARGINS ESPECIALLY ON DAY
 ONE AND HELP DRIVE THE STOCK
 HIGHER.
 OVER THE LONG-TERM RETAIL DOES
 GET OUT OF A STOCK THAT SEEMS TO
 BE EXPERIENCING SOME MOMENTUM ON
 THE DOWNSIDE.
 ON DAY ONE YOU CAN TRY AND COUNT
 ON THAT.
 WITH A COMPANY LIKE ZOOM, IT
 ISN'T A BRAND NAME AND IT
 DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A RETAIL
 COMPONENTS BUT FROM THE
 CONVERSATIONS I HAD YESTERDAY
 AND THIS MORNING, IT SAYS THE
 BOOK BUILDING PROCESS WAS SO
 STRONG FOR ZOOM THEY DID FEEL
 COMFORTABLE PRICING WHERE THEY
 DID.
 TYPICALLY, YOU DON'T GET
 LARGE ALLOCATION FOR RETAIL FOR
 THE ACTUAL IPO ITSELF.
 RETAIL IS EXPECTED TO COME IN
 AND IF JIM CRAMER WAS SITTING
 HERE HE MIGHT SAY DON'T AT LEAST
 GIVEN THESE LEVELS.
 TEN, 11 TIMES REVENUE IS PRETTY
 ASTOUNDING, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE
 GROWING THEIR REVENUE BASE OVER
 100% A YEAR.
 EXACTLY.
 YOU PAY A PREMIUM FOR GROWTH.
 WHEN YOU COMPARE THE TWO
 COMPANIES, PINTEREST WAS FOUNDED
 IN 2009, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A
 DECADE OLD COMPANY.
 ZOOM IS A LOT MORE RECENT, 2011
 I THINK IT WAS FOUNDED.
 CLEARLY MORE IN THE UPTICK STAGE
 FOR ZOOM THAN FOR LYFT BUT STILL
 VERY NICE TOP LINE GROWTH FOR
 THAT COMPANY WHICH IS LARGELY
 ADVERTISING BASE WHICH AS WE
 KNOW IS VERY COMPETITIVE.
 ADVERTISING REVENUES IN VERY
 MUCH IN VOGUE WHETHER IT'S
 PINTEREST OR ZOOM RIGHT NOW.
 THANKS, LESLIE.
 LET'S GET TO DOMINIC CHU
 BACK AT HQ WITH SOME NEWS OUT OF
 THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, DOM.
 NEW COMPANIES TOOK VERY OLD
 WORLD ONES, SHARES OF TOBACCO
 STOCK UNDER PRESSURE AFTER MITCH
 McCONNELL ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL
 INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO RAISE
 THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MINIMUM AGE
 TO BUY TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO 21
 YEARS OLD.
 IT CURRENTLY STANDS AT 18.
 HE PLANS TO INTRODUCE THAT BILL
 WHICH WILL COVER ALL TOBACCO
 PRODUCTS INCLUDING eCIGARETTES
 AS WELL AS SOME POINT IN THE
 NEXT MONTH.
 THE TWO DOZEN STATES ARE
 CONTEMPLATING SOME OF THAT
 SIMILAR LEGISLATION SO SHARES
 LIKE ALTRIA ALL MOVING TO THE
 DOWNSIDE RECOVERING SLIGHTLY
 HERE IN THE EARLY PART OF
 TRADING TODAY.
 BACK OVER TO YOU, CARL.
 FASCINATING STEP IN
 LEGISLATION.
 THANKS, DOM.
 LET'S GET BACK TO BOB PISANI
 ON THE FLOOR POST-DATE AND CHECK
 OUT WHAT THE LATEST IS ON
 PINTEREST, BOB.
 WE TALKING ABOUT PRICING 15
 TO 17, CAME IN AT 19 RIGHT NOW
 INDICATIONS ARE 23 TO 23.50.
 IT'S BEEN THERE FOR A LITTLE
 WHILE.
 PATTY MURPHY, WHAT CAN YOU TELL
 US.
 WE'RE KALED 23 AND A HALF.
 IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.
 THE CUSTOMERS GETTING REALLY
 CUSTOMER ON VOLUME.
 WE'RE PROBABLY A FEW MINUTES
 AWAY FROM CRUNCH TIME AND THEN
 RIGHT NOW THE CUSTOMERS ARE
 REALLY GETTING COMFORTABLE IN
 THAT RANGE.
 WHEN YOU SAY A FEW MINUTES
 AWAY, 15 MINUTES 20RKS MINUTES,
 HALF HOUR?
 TEN TO 15 MINUTES AWAY.
 WE'RE GETTING REALLY COMFORTABLE
 WITH THE BULK.
 WE'RE APPLYING GTS TECHNOLOGY TO
 CAPITALIZE AND DO THE DEPTH OF
 THE BOOK ON BOTH SIDES.
 THE CUSTOMERS ARE REALLY
 CRUNCHING TOGETHER IN THIS 23
 AND A HALF RANGE AND IT LOOKS
 GOOD.
 BUYERS AND SELLERS ARE BEHIND
 YOU SHOUTING OUT ORDERS TO BUY
 AND SELL AT THIS POINT.
 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT
 THAT IT'S BEEN AROUND 23 FOR A
 LITTLE WHILE NOW.
 IS THAT AN INDICATION THAT
 PEOPLE ARE HAPPY WITH THIS RANGE
 OR COULD THAT CHANGE
 IMMEDIATELY?
 IT COULD CHANGE, BUT I THINK
 WE'RE REALLY COMFORTABLE.
 LISTEN, 25% ABOVE THE DEAL
 PRICE, IT'S BEEN HEALTHY.
 THE VOLUME IS THERE.
 GLENN'S DOING A GOOD JOB OF
 TALKING TO THE BROKERS.
 HE'S GETTING A LOT OF GOOD
 INDICATIONS, RIGHT, GLENN?
 ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
 THEY SEEM REAL COMFORTABLE IN
 THIS PRICE RANGE AND, YOU KNOW,
 TEXTBOOK PRINT THAT LOOKS LIKE
 IT'S COMING UP AND WHAT A GREAT
 COMPANY, SO WE'RE PROBABLY ABOUT
 15 MINUTES AWAY.
 THANK YOU.
 THE IMPORTANT THING HERE AND I
 BROUGHT UP THAT $23 FOR A
 REASON.
 LAST WEEK WITH PAGERDUTY PRICED
 AT 24 STANDING RIGHT HERE AT
 THIS TIME, ALL OF A SUDDEN THE
 INDICATION FLASHED 37 TO 39
 PRICING AND THERE WAS A WAVE OF
 SELL ORDERS.
 YOU COULD HEAR IT FROM THE FLOOR
 COME IN.
 WHAT THAT MEANT WAS MORE THAN
 50% ABOVE THE PRICE, A LOT OF
 PEOPLE WHO WERE HAVING STOCK TO
 SELL, HEY, GREAT, YOU WANT IT AT
 39, TAKE IT.
 AND THE PRICE DROPPED AND IT
 OPENED AT $36.
 SO, YES THERE'S AN INDICATION
 THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
 COMFORTABLE AT 23 BUT IF IT GOES
 UP TO SAY 24 OR SO, WE COULD GET
 ANOTHER WAVE COME IN AND PRICE
 AT 22.
 IT REALLY IS A DYNAMIC AUCTION.
 THERE ARE PEOPLE JUST STANDING
 AROUND WITH STOCK TO BUY AND
 SELL AND THEY'RE YELLING AT EACH
 OTHER GOING INTO IT.
 YOU'RE WATCHING PINS, I GOT
 TO GET YOUR TAKE ON WHAT'S
 HAPPENING AT THE NASDAQ AND
 ZOOM
 THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT
 ZOOM IS VERY SIMPLE HERE.
 YOU'VE GOT A COMPANY THAT'S
 BRANDS NAME.
 YOU'VE GOT A COMPANY THAT'S
 PROFITABLE AND PROFITABLE ON A
 CASH FLOW BASIS AS WELL AND
 YOU'VE GOT A COMPANY THAT'S
 MAKING MONEY IN GENERAL, SO I
 THINK THAT IS A VERY, VERY
 IMPORTANT FACTOR.
 IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE PINTEREST IS
 LOSING MONEY BUT ONLY A VERY
 SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY,
 $50 MILLION A YEAR AND THAT'S A
 MAJOR FACTOR AS WELL.
 WE'LL BE WATCHING 23, 60 ON
 ZOOM.
 WE'RE WAITING THOSE IPOs WHEN
 THEY BEGIN TO TRADE.
 WE'LL TALK WITH BOTH CEOs.
 DOW HANGING ON TO  PNT52OIS, S&P
 DOWN TWO.
 DON'T GO AWAY.
 I need it to guide this analyst
     to customize flood     coverage for this house.
     So that this team,     can inform this couple,
   that their payment will   arrive faster than this guy.
               hey.

        so whether I'm        processing claims
  due to this fine gentleman...

      or suggesting premiums      for this young lady...
   AI can help change   everything at this company.
       Expect more from AI.
