 THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE
 FOR MORE VISIT
 CNBC.COM/INVESTINYOU
 WE ARE INVESTORS IN ACORNS, WE
 SHOULD NOTE.
 THAT DOES IT, A LONG
 WEEKEND, EVERYBODY, BUT WE'RE
 NOT DONE YET
 "POWER LUNCH" BEGINS RIGHT NOW.
 AND I AM INTIMIDIZED.
 GOOD MORNING.
 NEW AT 2:00, THE MUELLER REPORT
 IS OUT
 THE PRESIDENT DECLARES VICTORY,
 EXONERATION, BUT WILL THIS FIGHT
 CONTINUE TO HANG OVER HIS
 ADMINISTRATION AND MAYBE EVEN
 THE MARKETS?
 IT'S A HUGE DAY FOR IPOs
 SEVERAL OF THEM OF MAJOR
 INTEREST, BEGINNING WITH
 PINTEREST, AND SHARES OF ZOOM
 ARE ZOOMING HIGHER.
 PLUS KEVIN O'LEARY IS NOT
 HAPPY.
 MR. WONDERFUL IS ANGRY
 HE'S GOING TO JOIN US TO
 COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING THE
 EIGHTH PICK IN THE STOCK DRAFT
 SOUNDS LIKE THE NEW YORK KNICKS.
 "POWER LUNCH" STARTS RIGHT NOW
 WELCOME TO "POWER LUNCH.
 I'M COURT ANYTHING REAGAN.
 TWO IPOs, BOTH POPPING IN THEIR
 DEBUT.
 HEY THERE, COURT, A REDACTED
 VERSION OF THE MUELLER REPORT ON
 INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016
 ELECTION HAS BEEN RELEASED TO
 THE PUBLIC AND THE WHITE HOUSE
 EAMON HAS MORE.
 Reporter: WE'RE LEARNING MORE
 AND MORE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS
 400-PAGE REPORT BY BY BIT, THAT
 THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THE FIRING
 OF ROB MUELLER AND IT WAS THE
 WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL WHO DOESN'T
 FOLLOW THAT ORDER, SAYING THAT
 WHEN THE PRESIDENT CALL McGANN A
 SECOND TIME ON JUNE 17th HE
 RECALL HE WAS MORE DIRECT, CALL
 ROD, TELL MUELLER HAS CONFLICTS
 AND CAN'T BE SPECIAL COUNSEL --
 BECAUSE WILLIAM BARR BOO, THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL, SUGGESTED THAT
 BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
 TAKE ANY OVERT ACTION TO STOP
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
 INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD BE HARD
 TO MAKE THE CASE THAT HE WAS
 OBJECT INSTRUCTING JUSTICE
 THAT YOU BECAUSE IN THE END THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL WASN'T FIRED
 NOW WE'RE LEARNING THAT THE
 PRESIDENT DID ORDER THE FIRING,
 BUT DON McGAHN DID NOT
 SO IT'S POSSIBLY HE PROTECTED
 THE PRESIDENT, AND SET UP THE
 SITUATION WHERE THE MUELLER
 REPORT WAS UNABLE TO COME TO A
 CONCLUSION ON OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SAYING
 AS A RESULT OF THE PRESIDENT'S
 ACTIONS HERE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
 MAKE THE CASE THERE WAS ON
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 AS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL SAID,
 IT WAS DIFFERENT TO FIGURE OUT
 WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT WAS,
 BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T SIT
 DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW, BUT HE
 DID SAY HE FOUND HIS WRITTEN
 ANSWERS INSUFFICIENT I THINK WAS
 THE WORD HE USED.
 Reporter: I THINK THEY ALSO
 SAID THEY WERE INADEQUATE.
 THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTING A
 NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE WRITTEN
 ANSWERS HE DIDN'T REMEMBER,
 DIDN'T REAL VARIOUS INSTANCES.
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S TEAM
 WANTED TO TALK TO THIS
 PRESIDENT, HIS LAWYERS DID NOT
 WANT THEM TO TALK TO HIM, AND
 BECAUSE OF THAT THEY COULDN'T
 GET INSIDE THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD.
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL SUGGESTING
 THEY WERE SIMPLY OUT OF TIME AND
 IT WOULD BE A CONSTITUTIONAL
 BATTLE TO FIGHT TO FORCE, TO
 ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE PRESIDENT
 TO SIT DOWN IN PERSON AND TALK
 TO THEM.
 HE DECIDED ULTIMATELY NOT TO
 PURSUE IT, NOT TO ISSUE THAT
 SUBPOENA FOR THE PRESIDENT'S
 PERSONAL TESTIMONY
 THAT'S PARTS OF, IT WOULD
 APPEAR, WHY THIS RECORD ENDED
 THE WAY IT DID.
 EAMON, THANK YOU.
 YOU BET
 A LOT OF READING FOR MANY OF
 US THIS WEEKEND TO DO.
 MARKETS SHRUGGING OFF THE
 MUELLER REPORT, BUT WITH A PAIR
 OF HIGH-PROFILE IPOs HITTING THE
 TICKER, THERE'S STILL PLENTY TO
 CAPTURE THE ATTENTION OF
 INVESTORS.
 BOB PISANI IS ON THE FLOOR OF
 THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
 WE'RE ABOUT 10% THROUGH THE
 EARNINGS SEASON, BELIEVE IT OR
 NOT.
 HE'S THE KEYING FOR THE WHOLE
 EARNINGS SEASON, BEATS WELL
 ABOVE TYPICAL BEATS.
 DOVER BEAD BY 12 SPEAKERS,
 HONEYWELL BY, TRAVELERS, UNION
 PACIFIC.
 ON A TYPICAL TIME POLL OF THE
 TIME YOU'LL SEE ABOUT 3%
 EARNINGS BEATS, AND THEY'RE
 BETTER THAT ARE EXPECTED,
 BECAUSE ANALYSTS CUT TOO MUCH IN
 DECEMBER
 ALL OF THESE STOCKS TRADING TO
 THE UP SIDE.
 THE OTHER STORY TODAY IPOs,
 PINTEREST, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
 15 TO $17.
 IT OPENS AT 2375
 YOU SEE HERE TRADING ABOVE THAT
 NUMBER ITSELF.
 ZOOM, EVEN BIGGER STORY.
 JUST FOUR DAYS AGO WE WERE
 TALKING 28 TO 32
 WAIT -THEY PRICE AT 36, IT
 OPENS AT 65.
 THAT'S NOT A TYPO, AND TRADING
 RIGHT AROUND WHERE IT OPENED
 SO WHAT'S GOING TO BE NEXT
 WE DON'T KNOW, BUT HERE'S SOME
 THOUGHTS
 APRIL 22nd, IHEART MEDIA COULD
 POTENTIALLY ANNOUNCE TERMS
 THAT'S ONE OF THE UNICORNS OUT
 THERE, AND POTENTIALLY NEXT
 FRIDAY, APRIL 26th, UBER COULD
 POTENTIAL DO THAT.
 MORE LIKELY THE FOLLOWING WEEKS.
 TERMS, NOT GOING PUBLIC, BUT
 ANNOUNCING WHEN IT MIGHT BE AND
 A RANGE OF PRICING
 A LOT OF STUFF COMING DOWN
 20 IPOs, TYLER, IN THE MONTH OF
 MAY, AT LEAST, MAYBE AS MANY AS

 SUPPLY IS COMING.
 ROBERT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WEEKLY JOBLESS CLAIMS IN
 RETAIL SALES PAINTING A ROSY
 PICTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMIC
 STEVE LEASH IESMAN IS HERE WITH
 A WEAK ECONOMY THAT CAUSED SO
 MUCH CONCERN LATE LAST YEAR,
 SUDDENLY NOT THAT WEAK
 A COMBINATION OF BETTER TRADE
 AND RETAIL DATA HAS ECONOMISTS
 MARKING IT UP FOR THE FORECAST,
 AND DO IT SHARPLY.
 AS TILE HER WAS SAYING, GROWTH
 AT 2.4%, A LONG WAY FROM THE 1%
 FORECAST AS EARLY AS MARCH
 IT'S NOT GROWTH LIKE LAST YEAR,
 AND CURRENT QUARTER IS FORECAST
 TO COME IN RIGHT ABOUT THE SAME.
 THERE'S MORE DATA TO COME, AND
 SOME ARE CAUTIOUS HERE
 RETAIL SALES WERE UP 1.6%.
 WE HAD STRENGTH IN ELECTRONICS,
 INTERNET SALES, GROCERY STORES
 AND CLOTHING, AND JOBLESS CLAIMS
 FALLING FOR 192,000, FROM WHAT I
 CAN TELL THAT'S THE LOWERS LEVEL
 SITS 1969, THERE WERE A LOT
 FEWER WORKERS BACK THEN.
 SO THE FED LIKELY TO NOT HIKE
 RATES, BUT THOSE WHO WERE CUT
 THEY WOULD CUT RATES, THEY'LL BE
 DISAPPOINTED
 AN ECONOMYING RUNNING AT 2.5%
 DOESN'T NEED HELP FROM THE
 CENTRAL BANK
 OWNERSHIP DO QUAINT AT A TIMIVE
 EASING AGAIN
 WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.
 IF I CAN DO BACK TO THE
 RETAIL, CLOTHING UP 2%.
 WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?
 FOR FOLKS TO KNOW, COURTNEY AND
 I SIT RELATIVELY CLOSE, WE HAVE
 A RUNNING THING ABOUT WHAT SHE
 HEARS FROM THE STORIES AND A LOT
 OF TIMES THEY CLASH.
 WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
 AGAIN I THINK IT'S
 CONFLICTING.
 I THINK SOME ARE STRONG, SOME
 ARE NOT.
 THERE'S STILL AREAS OF WEAKNESS
 IN DEPARTMENT STORES
 IT'S A COOL THING THAT'S
 HAPPENING MAYBE WE WON'T BE
 ARGUING, BECAUSE THE DATA WILL
 BE THE SAME.
 TIMES I -OR AS ZAPPA CALLED
 IT, THE --
 THE DOW ON PACE TO MOST ITS
 THIRD WEEKLY GAIN CAN THE DC
 DRAMA DERAIL THE RALLY
 JIM, I'M GOING TO ASK A TILER
 MATHISEN COMPOUND QUESTION
 NOW REAR TRACKING FIRST QUARTER
 GDP.
 THEY HAD THIS MUELLER REPORT,
 WHICH I THINK WE CAN GREAT IS
 RELATIVELY BENIGN.
 IF WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY AND
 A PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
 IN ANY SORT OF LEGAL JEOPARDY,
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 DO YOU THINK THE MARKETS ARE
 HAPPY WITH TRUMP
 COULD HE BE REELECTED?
 IS IT GOOD FOR THE MARKETS GOING
 FORWARD?
 I THINK ON THE TRUMP
 QUESTION, THE TIMING OF GROWTH
 AND THE CHARACTER OF THE ECONOMY
 IS WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO THE
 ELECTRIC
 IN SOME SENSE WE MAY LOOK BACK
 AND SAY THE SLOWDOWN, IF THERE
 WAS ONE HERE, IN 2019 MIGHT HAVE
 BEEN GREAT TIMING FOR THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY, IN THE SENSE
 IF IT SLOWS DOWN AND WE BRING
 THE FULL POLICSE
 BUTTON, AND WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
 HOW MUCH TIME, TO GREG'S POINT
 EVEN THOUGH THE ECONOMIC WOULD
 YOU FLOWING -AND BROUGHT IT TO
 A PAUSE, SO WE HAD POSSIBLE
 EASE
 NOW WE'RE JUST ENTERING A PERIOD
 WHERE WE'LL HAVE REVIVE AND
 GROWTH WITHOUT FED TIGHTENING.
 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, TOO.
 I THINK THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY
 COULD GO FROM 2.6, AND IT
 WOULDN'T HURT STOCKS
 AT SOME OF THE POINT THE FED
 WILL BE TIGHTENING AGAIN, AND
 ULTIMATELY THE FED OVERDOES IT,
 BUT THERE'S ANOTHER GOOD PERIOD
 WHERE GROWTH ACCELERATES WITHOUT
 TIGHTENING THAT I THINK THE
 MARKET COULD DO WELL IN AS WELL.
 I THINK THE KEY THINK IS,
 YES, THE FED HIT THE PAW BUTTON.
 I THEY'RE DONE FOR A YEAR.
 I THINK THAT HELPS RISK ASSETS
 IT'S JUST YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
 WHAT DO PEOPLE HATE HERE
 I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL VERY
 NEGATIVE
 I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL MORE
 CAUTIOUS ABOUT EQUITIES, SO
 MAYBE A BET OVERWEIGHT EM.
 WHAT WE HAVE HERE, WE HAVE SNNK
 BANKS THAT SEEN -AND SO I I
 THINK WITH CENTRAL BANKS RATES
 ARE VERY LOW, I THINK THIS IS
 THE TIME TO TAKE A RISK HERE
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF LARRY
 FISK'S COMMENT, THERE ARE A LOT
 OF NONBELIEVERS OUT THERE.
 YOU'VE HAD MONEY GOING INTO THE
 WRONG PLACES
 THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GET
 REDEPLOYED, AND THUS YOU'LL HAVE
 A MARKET MELT-UP
 YOU BUY THAT
 I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE, SCOTT.
 I REALLY DO.
 I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
 ON WALL STREET THAT THINK THE
 MARKET WILL GO HIGHER THE REST
 OF THIS YEAR, BUT THERE'S VERY
 FEW THAT THINK IT WOULD GO A LOT
 HIGHER
 MAYBE THE SURPRISE IS NOW THAT
 IT'S GOING TO FALL OR GO HIGHER,
 MAYBE IT BLOWS MUCH HIGHER THAN
 IT SHOULD.
 THEY COMPRISE NOW ABOUT 35% OF
 MARKET CAPITALIZATION DOWN FROM
 ALMOST 44% FROM EARLIER IN THE
 RECOVERY, AND ALMOST 15
 PERFECT -IN OTHER WORDS,
 CYCLICALITY IS VERY SCAROUS
 RIGHT NOW.
 SO TO DAVID ACE POINT, MAKE WHAT
 YOU COULD DO IS TAKE --
 INCLUDING NATIONAL MARKETS, AND
 IF WE DO HIT A PERIOD OF
 EXUBERANCE, THERE WOULD BE A LOT
 OF UNDERWEIGHTED PORTFOLIOS THAT
 NEED TO REDUCE THAT YOU ARE
 UNDERWEIGHTS.
 GENTLEMAN, WE'RE GOING TO
 LEAVE IT THERE
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
 HAVE A NICE WEEKEND.
 NEW HEADLINES CROSSING ON
 THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE NAFTA
 UPDATE NEGOTIATED BY THE RHO
 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, NOT PASSED
 YET, OF COURSE.
 SCOTT, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
 CALLED THIS A TOP PRIORITY
 THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE IS
 BREAKING WHAT IT EXPECTS TO BE
 THE IMPACT ON ONE INDUSTRY, THE
 AUTO INDUSTRY.
 BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH AUTO
 EXECUTIVES USTR SAYS THE NEW
 DEAL WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT
 INCREASES IN HIRING, AND OUTPUT
 TO NEW INVESTMENT IN THE U.S.,
 $23 BILLION IN NEW PURCHASING OF
 PARTS, AND 76,000 NEW U.S. JOBS.
 COMPANIES ARE EXPECTING ABOUT A
 THIRD OF THOSE WILL BE ON THE
 ASSEMBLY LINE AND THE REST FROM
 VARIOUS SUPPLIERS, BUT IT COMES
 IN ADVANCE OF A FULL INDEPENDENT
 REPORT ON THE DEAL'S ECONOMIC
 IMPACT
 THAT'S EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED
 A SENIOR USTR OFFICIAL SAYS THE
 OFFICE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THE
 TRADE FINDINGS WILL BE, AND
 THERE WAS NO MENTION IN A
 BRIEFING OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT
 ON AUTO TARIFFS.
 GUYS
 KAYLA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WHETHER WE RETURN, IF YOU
 THOUGHT THE RELEASE OF THE
 MUELLER REPORT WAS THE END OF
 THE FIGHT OVER THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION, DO NOT
 HOLD YOUR BREATH
 WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT COULD BE
 NEXT, WHAT OTHER INVESTIGATIONS
 COULD BE IN THE PIPELINE AND
 WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE
 PRESIDENT'S AGENDA.
 PLUS TWO MAJOR TECH IPOs HIT
 THE TICKER TODAY
 THEY ARE BOTH UP
 WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE SOME
 ZOOM
 WE'LL TELL YOU HOW THEY'RE
 TRADING AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR
 THE WAVE OF OTHER STARTUPS
 STAY WITH "POWER LUNCH."
  When you rent from National...
  it's kind of like playing your  own version of best ball.
 Because here, you can choose any car in the aisle,
 even if it's a better car class than the one you reserved.
        So no matter what,
   you're guaranteed to have a   perfect drive.
            [LAUGHTER]
 (VO) Go National. Go Like a Pro.
      See what I did there?
 WELCOME BACK TO"POWER LUNCH.
 THE MUELLER REPORT IS OUT, BUT
 IS IT OVER AND DONE WITH
 I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWER
 TO THAT.
 WHERE DO WASHINGTON AND WALL
 STREET GO FROM HERE?
 LET'S BRING IN FORMER FEDERAL
 PROSECUTOR, NOW A PARTNER AT
 DICKINSON WRIGHT, JAMES FRANKEL,
 AND BEN WHITE, AND TONY FRATTO,
 FOUNDER, ALSO A CNBC
 CONTRIBUTOR.
 GENTLEMEN, WELCOME
 WE ARE A BUSINESS NETWORK.
 I'M GOING TO TRY TO MAKE IT A
 BUSINESS AND POLITICAL AGENDA
 DISCUSSION
 I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET TO THE
 BOTTOM OF WHAT IS IN THIS
 INCREDIBLE REPORT.
 IT'S A RICH READ
 BUT LET ME START WITH YOU,
 JACOB.
 THE KEY TO THIS REPORT IS IN THE
 BACK HALF, VOLUME 2, WHERE THE
 DISCUSSION OF OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE BECOMES VERY DENSE
 WOULD YOU, AS A PROSECUTOR,
 HAVING SATISFIED IF YOU WERE NOT
 ABLE TO INTERVIEW THE FOCUS OF
 THAT OBSTRUCTION INQUIRY, YOU
 WERE ONLY ALLOWED TO SUPPLY
 WRITTEN QUESTIONS, AND YOU WERE
 NOT ALLOWED AS PART OF YOUR
 INQUIRY TO INCLUDE IN THOSE
 QUESTIONS ANYTHING HAVING TO DO
 WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE?
 I WOULD HAVE FOUND SUCH
 LIMITATION RATHER OBJECTIONABLE,
 NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT, BUT
 ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
 THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS
 PROCESS ALL TOGETHER
 THERE IS A CLEARLY, AS WE KNOW,
 YOU KNOW, A ACCOMPLICE CAL
 OVERTONE TO EVERYTHING THAT'S
 DONE
 ULTIMATELY THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
 THAT THE SPECIAL ARE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL CAN DO, PARTICULARLY IF
 HE'S TRYING TO GET OUT A FINAL
 REPORT
 HE DID THE RIGHT THING AND
 FOLLOWED A TRADITIONAL MODEL,
 WHICH IS GET ALL THE INFORMATION
 ON PAPER, GET IT BEFORE THE
 POLITICAL BODY, LET CONGRESS
 MAKE THE DISCUSSION.
 ULTIMATELY WHAT I HAVE READ INTO
 THIS IS WHERE BOB MUELLER WAS
 NOT PREPARED OR NOT ABLE TO MAKE
 THE PROSECUTORIAL DECISION,
 THERE'S STILL THAT LAT OF
 CLARITY INTO THE INTERPRETATION
 OF THE PHRASE HIGH CRIMES AND
 MISDEMEANORS, BASICALLY PUNTING
 TO CONGRESS TO MAKE THE
 POLITICAL DECISION HOW TO GO
 FORWARD.
 THAT'S WHERE I THINK A LOT OF
 US FEEL IT GOES ULTIMATELY, IS
 THAT IT WAS A PUNT TO CONGRESS
 I THINK ALSO MR. MUELLER FELT
 THAT HIS HANDS WERE TIED, FAR
 MORE THAN WE WERE LED TO
 BELIEVE, BY A DEPARTMENT OF
 JUSTICE RULING, INDICATING THAT
 A SITTING PRESIDENT CANNOT BE
 TRIED.
 BEN, IS THE TRUMP AGENDA
 BASICALLY NOW DEAD IN THE WATER?
 BECAUSE I -I FRANKLY CAN'T
 IMAGINE THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING
 TO LET HIM GET MUCH DONE.
 NO, THEY'RE NOT
 I DON'T THINK IT'S DEAD IN THE
 WATER.
 A LOT OF HIS AGENDA IS TRADE
 RELATED AND U.N. LAT RAY
 UNILATERAL

 IS.
 WHAT MUELLER HAS DONE IS
 HANDED A BUNCH OF INFORMATION TO
 CONGRESS
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK WITH
 TRUMP ON SIGNIFICANT
 LEGISLATION.
 TONY, IS THERE A CHANCE THAT
 THE PRESIDENT LOSES ANY SUPPORT
 AMONG HIS REPUBLICAN -MAYBE
 NOT THE BATES AND THE HARD-CORE
 CONSTITUENTS, BUT OTHERS ON
 CAPITOL HILL WHO MAY LOOK AT
 THIS REPORT AND SEE THINGS THAT
 ARE DAMNING WITHIN IT?
 IT IS AN UGLY REPORT.
 IF IT AT ALL TIMES SHORT OF ANY
 CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, AND THAT'S AT
 LEAST WHAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 DETERMINATION THAT HE COULD
 MAKE, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN
 THERE THAT ARE PROPERTY PRETTY
 TO READ AND ARE PRETTY DAMNING
 FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND
 ACTIVITIES OF THE PRESIDENT
 HIMSELF.
 DOES THAT MOVE REPUBLICANS,
 EITHER THE BASE OR MEMBERS
 YOW KNOW THAT THERE'S ANYTHING
 NEW IN HERE THAT COULD IMPACT
 WHICH WAY THEY'RE GOING TO GO?
 TRUMP IS INCREDIBLY POPULAR IN
 THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
 WE DIDN'T SEE HIM INCREASE HIS
 POPULARITY WHEN THE BARR SUMMARY
 CAME OUT
 I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE HIM
 DECREASE HI POPULARITY WITH THIS
 REPORT.
 HAS THE BARB LOWERED?
 YOU SAID EARLIER BARR DID THE
 KIND OF JOB A REALLY GOOD
 SPOKESMAN FOR THE PRESIDENT
 WOULD DO
 HOW DOES HE --
 IT WAS UNUSUAL, AS A FORMER
 SPOKESMAN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE,
 WITH THE WHITE HOUSE SPEAKING
 FOR PRESIDENTS, IT'S A KIND OF
 JUMP YOU MIGHT EXPECT A GOOD
 PRESS SECRETARY TO GIVE A
 CLEANER PRESENTATION, AND I
 DON'T THINK HE DID HIMSELF
 FAVORS, BUT HE DID DO A FAVOR
 FOR THE GUY IN THE ROUND OFFICE
 WATCHING IT AND I THINK PAYING
 CLOSE ATTENTION.
 JACOB, WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS
 WITH BEN, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
 ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS THE TRUMP
 AGENDA, NOW THAT THAT IS AT
 LEAST OUT THERE, IT'S NOT OVER
 WITH, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED, BUT
 AT LEAST OUT THERE
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE TRUMP
 AGENDA ECONOMICALLY?
 I THINK BACK TO, YOU KNOW, TO
 A CONVERSATION BACK IN JUNE OF
 217, WHEN WE WERE WATCHING THE
 SENATE HEARINGS, THE MARKET WAS
 HITTING ALL-TIME HIGHING DURING
 THAT HEARINGS AT THE SENATE.
 I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A
 RECOGNITION THAT ONCE THE BAD
 INFORMATION HITS THE MARKET, IT
 THEN ACTUALLY GETS ASSIMILATED
 INTO THE MARKET, AND ULTIMATELY
 THEN, THE AGENDA WILL PUSH
 FORWARD HOWEVER THE ECONOMIC
 WILL ALLOW IT TO DO SO, TO ALL
 THE POINTS WE'VE GOT DISCUSSION
 HERE
 THE FACT THAT THERE REALLY IS
 LITTLE NEW INFORMATION, YOU
 KNOW, THAT'S COME OUT, THOUGH
 IT'S A VERY UGLY REPORT FOR THE
 PRESIDENT.
 THE FACT REMAINS THE MARKETS ARE
 GOING TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO
 RESPOND.
 BEN MAID THE POINT ABOUT THE
 UNILATERAL NATURE OF THE TRADE
 AGENDA
 I DON'T THINK MUCH WILL CHANGE
 IN THE MARKET, EVEN IF CONGRESS
 WERE TO CONSIDER IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS.
 YEAH, I THINK THE POINT ON
 THAT IS EVEN IF THE HOUSE WERE
 TO GET TO IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEDURES, NO -THERE'S NOT
 ENOUGH IN HERE TO CHANGE
 REPUBLICANS' MINDS IN THE
 SENATE, HE WOULD NOT EXONERATED
 IN THE SENATE LIKE BILL CLINTON
 WAS IN 1998.
 THANK YOU, GUISE.
 MASTER CHEF ON BOBBY FLAY
 MEETS NOAH AND MR. WONDERFUL AND
 TIM SEYMOUR WILL SQUARE OFF.
 ANOTHER DOWN DAY FOR THE SECTOR,
 FALLING FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT
 DAY.
 IS THAT SECTOR READY TO PERK UP
 YTSOON
 WE'LL DEBATE, COMING UP.
 STAY WITH POWER.

 I'M CONTESSA BREWER, HERE IS YOUR UPDATE THIS HOUR.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE'S
 HAVING A GOOD DAY.
 WHILE HE ATTENDED A WOUNDED
 WARRIOR EVENT AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE.
 THIS AS THE MUELLER REPORT WAS
 BEING RELEASED.
 I'M HAVING A GOOD DAY, TOO.
 IT WAS CALLED NO COLLUSION, NO
 OBSTRUCTION.
 IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO
 ANOTHER PRESIDENT AGAIN.
 NEW YORK POLICE SAY THEY
 HAVE FORMALLY CHARGED MARK
 LAMPRELIO WITH TRESPASSING
 HE BROUGHT TWO GAS CANS OF GAS,
 LIGHTER FLUID TO ST. PATRICK'S
 CATHEDRAL.
 JAMES HOLZHAUER, HIS
 STRATEGY STARTS AT THE BOTTOM OF
 THE BOARD, HE ACCRUES LOTS OF
 MONEY AND THEN BETS HUGE
 AMOUNTS, OFTEN SAYING ALL IN,
 AND JUST RAKES IN THE DOUGH.
 I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A
 WAY -HE'S A PROFESSIONAL
 GAMBLER, SCOTT, SO I'M GOING TO
 FIND ON WAY TO APPLY IT.
 THEY CALL THAT STRTEJERY, I
 THOUGHT.
 PINTEREST RISING 28% RIGHT NOW
 TAKE A LOOK AT ZOOM.
 HIGHER BY -ABOUT $63 A SHARE,
 THAT'S UP 75% FROM ITS INITIAL
 PRICING, WITH US NOW IS LESLIE
 PICKER
 GOOD TO HAVE YOU ALL HERE.
 LESLIE, THE PRICE IS RIGHT, IT
 APPEARS, FOR BOTH OF THESE.
 PRICE IS RIGHT FOR NVESTORS
 THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE.
 THE PRICE MAY BE LESS RIGHT FOR
 THE COMPANIES RAISING MONEY,
 GIVEN TODAY'S AFTER-MARK
 PERFORMANCE.
 I GUESS IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR
 THAT'S PUTTING YOUR MONEY INTO
 THESE COMPANIES, LOOKING TO DO
 FUTURE IPOs, THIS IS THE
 AFTER-MARKET PERFORMANCE YOU
 WANT TO SEE, BUT IF YOU'RE A
 COMPANY THAT NEEDED THAT CAPITAL
 TO GROW FURTHER IN THE FUTURE,
 YOU MAY HAVE LIKED A BIT MORE
 CASH IN THE COFFER.
 NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
 DEE, PIN TRESEMME BE THE MORE
 HOUSEHOLD NAME, IF YOU WILL, BUT
 ZOOM, BOY, WHAT A GREAT DAY FOR
 THOSE SHARES, UP 75%, AS WE
 SAID, FOR A COMPANY THAT
 ACTUALLY IS PROFITABLE
 YEAH, SCOTT, THAT'S A VERY
 GOOD POINT
 I NOTICE PEN TRES DOESN'T WANT
 TO BE CALLED A SOCIAL NETWORK,
 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT?
 CLOUD ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE.
 IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT IT'S DONE
 IN THIS VERY CROWDED FIELD
 THIS IS A RARE BREED OF UNICORN.
 NOT ONLY IS IT GROWING FASTER
 THAN PINTEREST, UBER AND LYFT,
 BUT AS YOU WANT, IT'S
 PROFITABLE
 NEARLY $8 MILLION OF PROFIT ON
 ABOUT 350 MILLION OF REVENUE,
 WHICH IS ACTUALLY HALF THAT OF
 PINTEREST LAST YEAR, YET LOOK AT
 THE VALUATIONS HERE.
 TODAY'S PRICE ACTION PUTS ZOOM
 AT ABOUT 16 BILLION MARKET CAP
 THAT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN
 PINTEREST.
 YOU KNOW, JULIA, WHEN YOU
 LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH
 ZOOM, YOU CAN SAY, AS LESLIE
 DID, THAT MAYBE SOME MONEY WAS
 LEFT ON THE TABLE, BUT CERTAINLY
 THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THAT STOCK
 HAVE TO FEEL PRETTY GOOD,
 BECAUSE THE STOCK IS NOW 76%
 HIGHER THAN IT WAS JUST FIVE
 HOURS AGO.

 AND WHO KNOWS WHERE IT'S GOING
 TO BE IN SIX MONTHS.
 YES
 THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY LOCK-UP
 PROVISIONS, TYLER.
 IT'S WORTH NOTING THERE WAS THIS
 DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT
 WOULD END UP BEING WORTH IN THE
 PUBLIC MARKETS MORE OR LESS THAN
 THE MOST RECENT PRIVATE MARKET
 VALUATION.
 THE START OF TRADING WAS CLEAR
 THAT INVESTORS DO SEE IT BEING
 WORTH MORE THAN THE LAST PRIVATE
 MARKET VALUATION, THERE IS A
 SENSE OF THE VALUE IN GOING
 PUBLIC THERE
 SO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT IMPACTS
 THE VALUATION OF IPOs GOING
 FORWARD.
 IT'S GROWING THE REVENUE
 SIGNIFICANTLY, AND MAKING IT'S
 PROFITS SMALLER EVERY QUARTER
 ONE OF THOSE IS INTERNAL NARD PA
 EXPANSE.
 WE'RE SEEING THE POTENTIAL TO
 MAKE IT EASIER TO BUY THINGS TO
 CONNECT CONSUMERS WITH THE
 PERFORM OF THE
 INDEPENDENCE-TO-END SHOPPING
 EXPERIENCE
 IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT PINTEREST
 DOES NOT TAKE A CUT OF THE
 E-COMMERCE THAT GOES THROUGH THE
 PLATFORM, BUT IT WANTS

 YOU KNOW THERE'S EXCITEMENT AROUND A NEW CAR WHEN IT SPORTS
 A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG,
 BUT STILL SELLS OUT IN LESS THAN
 A WEEK
 ROBERT FRANK IS AT THE NEW YORK
 AUTO SHOW WITH MORE.
 Reporter: THIS IS THE FASTEST
 PRODUCTION CAR IN EXISTENCE.
 IT GOES 300 MILES AN HOUR, COSTS
 $3 MILLION, THE BEST PART IS
 THAT IT SOLD OUT IN JUST FIVE
 DAYS
 IT'S MADE BY KOENIGSEGG.
 IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE NAME,
 YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT ALONE.
 IT'S ONE OF THE ULTRA--EXCLUSIVE
 BRANDS IN THE CAR WORLD KNOWN
 ONLY TO THE SUPER-RICH
 MOST OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE YOUNG
 ENTREPRENEURS, OBVIOUS IN TECH
 THEY PROBABLY WON'T DRIVE IT 300
 MILES AN HOUR, BUT THEY LIKE THE
 STATUS OF KNOWING THAT THEY CAN.
 KNOWING THAT YOUR CAR IS THE
 FASTERS IN THE WORLD AND IF YOU
 PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF A
 PROFESSIONAL DRIVER ON A SAFE
 PLACE, THAT IT CAN DO THAT, THAT
 IT CAN BREAK THOSE RECORDS AND
 MAKE HISTORY, THAT'S A COOL
 THING.
 Reporter: VERY COOL THING
 THE OTHER COOL THINGS IS THE
 NAME JESKO IS NAMED AFTER THE
 FOUNDER'S FATHER WHO PUT HIS
 ENTIRE SAVINGS, WHEN IT WAS
 ABOUT TO GO UNDER.
 HOPEFULLY HE CAN PAY HIS DAD
 BACK.
 ROBERT.
 THANK YOU, SWEET RIDE.
 EXPENSIVE RIDE.
 BUT IF THE TRAFFIC IS STUFF
 ON THE CROSS-BRONX, YOU'RE NOT
 GOING FAST.
 YOU'RE SITTING PRETTY, AREN'T
 YOU?
 YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD, STYLING.
 SMOKIES WILL BE CHASING YOU
 QUICK, NO MATTER WHERE YOU DRIVE
 IT.
 THE DRAFT ORDER IS SET, THE
 STOCK LIST IS FINALIZED.
 WE ARE IN FINAL COUNTDOWN FOR
 THE "POWER LUNCH" STOCK DRAFT.
 STILL AHEAD.
 TIM SEYMOUR HAS THE FIRST PICK
 MR. O'LEARY HAS A LOT OF
 COLATSMPIN APPARENTLY, NOT SO
 WONDERFUL-FEELING TODAY.
 WE'RE BACK IN TWO MINUTES.
       We got no free pass.
       Everything we have,          we've earned.
    The unmistakable Lexus IS.

 A RAE PEAT WON'T COME EASY FOR NICK VALERIE
 WILL THE WALL STREET MENTALIST
 TAME MR. WONDERFUL
 AND CAN THE MAVENS DELIVER
 IT'S A SUPER SIZED STOCK DRAFT
 WELL, YOU JUST HEARD IT
 THERE.
 WE'RE ONE WEEK AWAY FROM THE
 BIGGEST STOCK DRAFT EVER
 FORGET THE NFL
 NOR GET ABOUT KYLER MURRAY,
 OKAY, FOLKS.
 THE DRAFT ORDER HAS BEEN SET
 WE PICKED IT YESTERDAY
 TIM SEYMOUR GETS THE NUMBER ONE
 PICK
 THINGS DID NOT TURN OUT SO WELL
 FOR OUR FIRST -OUR CHAMPION
 BEFORE LAST, PICK NUMBER EIGHT
 AS A MATTER OF FACT, KEVIN WAS
 SO FURIOUS HE CALLED OUR
 PRODUCER GENO LATE LAST NIGHT
 AND LEFT A NOT-SAFE-FOR-WORK
 MESSAGE VOICING HIS GRIEVANCES,
 THREATENING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST
 OUR DRAFT COMMISSIONERS.
 HE EVEN TALKED ABOUT COLLUSION
 KEVIN O'LEARY, TIM SEYMOUR,
 WELCOME.
 DISAPPOINTING.
 YOU SUSPECT A DEEP STATE
 CONSPIRACYIST HERE, KEVIN?
 I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE
 CHINESE OR THE RUSSIANS BUT
 SOMETHING IS WRONG IN THE STATE
 OF DENMARK HERE, AND I WILL TELL
 YOU WHY.
 YOU TALK ABOUT ANY LEG, YOU
 REMEMBER I WON THIS THING TWO
 DRAFTS AGO
 I CRUSHED THE COMPETITION.
 YESTERDAY'S NEWS.
 KEEP GOING.
 DOESN'T MATTER.
 NOW THAT I CAME IN BELOW TIM
 SEYMOUR, I SHOULD OBVIOUSLY IN
 ANY LEAGUE GET THE FIRST PICK.
 BUT THE COMMISSIONER SENT MY
 THIS NOTICE LAST NIGHT, I CALLED
 MUELLER'S OFFICE IMMEDIATELY
 DEMANDING FULL TRANSPARENCY.
 WE NEED AN INVESTIGATION
 THERE'S COLLUSION.
 THERE'S SOME KIND OF A PROBLEM
 HERE AND WE HAVE TO AIR THIS
 IT'S STRONG, ABSOLUTELY STRONG
 I AM NOT THE KIND OF GUY WHO
 LIKES TO BUT I'M READY TO
 LITIGATE.
 KEVIN, YOU FINISH ED FIFTH
 LAST YEAR, NOT IN LAST PLACE.
 OUT OF HOW MANY THOUGH?
 OUT OF EIGHTH.
 YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN
 IN LAST.
 IT FELT LIKE LAST TO MR.
 WONDERFUL.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING,
 TIM, YOU HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR
 CANNABIS STOCKS.
 I DO.
 ALTHOUGH WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
 ABOUT THE INFLUENCE WE'RE UNDER
 FOR THIS DRAFT
 IN FACT, I THINK BASED UPON THE
 MOVE AND THE HIGHS THESE STOCKS
 ARE ON, THAT MAY NOT BE MY
 STRATEGY IN 2019, TYLER.
 WE HAVE A LIST OF 60 STOCKS
 INCLUDING TILRAY, CANNABIS
 COMPANY.
 YOU CAN BUY BITCOIN IF YOU WANT
 OR OIL
 KEVIN, IT SAYS IN MY NOTES YOU
 AND FELL KBROETER BETHENNY
 FRANKEL MAY TEAM UP SOMEHOW AND
 COLLUDE?
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL
 HAPPEN
 IT WILL BE A NASTY SMACKDOWN
 NEXT THURSDAY WHEN IT HAPPENS.
 I HAVE NOT DECIDED MY STRATEGY
 YET BUT I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING
 WRONG HERE
 I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
 ELSE I HAVE A BIG BEEF WITH, I'M
 A DIVIDEND INVESTOR.
 I'M ABOUT RETURN OF CAPITAL.
 I DON'T GET MY DIVIDENDS
 INCLUDED
 I WANT TO SHORT TILRAY, I KCAN'
 DO THAT!
 I WANT THE CHAIRMAN TO LISTEN TO
 MY GRIEVANCES OR MUELLER'S GOING
 TO BE ALL OVER THEM
 IF IT'S SNOWY, WINDY, RAINING
 DAY IN THE MEADOWLANDS, YOU HAVE
 TO PLAY IN THE CONDITIONS OUT
 THERE.
 I WOULD STOP WHINING AND BRING
 YOUR A-GAME.
 TEAMING UP WITH THE OTHER TEAM
 SOUNDS LIKE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
 BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS A UNIQUE
 SET OF CONDITIONS FOR THE STOCK
 DRAFT.
 IT'S A LIMITED HORIZON
 IF ANYTHING, IT'S AN OPTION AND
 NOT WORRYABOUT DIVIDENDS.
 TIM, YOU GET THREE PICKS.
 YOU HAVE TO HOLD THESE FROM
 APRIL 25th UNTIL JANUARY 31.
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
 BE AVAILABLE WHEN IT COMES UP
 IS, LIKE ANOTHER DRAFT
 CAN YOU GIVE US ANY INSIGHT INTO
 WHAT STOCKS YOU WILL PICK
 WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY
 YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL BE
 AVAILABLE WHEN IT'S YOUR TURNS
 ANYWAY
 MUM'S THE WORD, BUT I DO HAVE
 NUMBER ONE PICK, THIS COULD BE
 MY AUNDRAY BRUCE TIM COUCH
 MOMENT
 MAYBE I WILL TRADE BACK WITH
 KEVEN ON THE NUMBER FIVE PICK.
 WHO KNOWS?
 BUT MY TACTIC IS FIND DEEP VALUE
 OR NAMES THAT HAVE SOME KIND OF
 DISLOCATION.
 I WOULD LIKE AN EVENT-DRIVEN
 STORY FOR A 12-MONTH DRAFT
 ESPECIALLY SOMETHING I THINK HAS
 BEEN TRADING OUT OF THE MONEY.
 KEVIN, GIVEN YOUR LACK OF
 SUCCESS -SORRY -WITH BLUE
 APRON A YEAR AGO, WOULD YOU
 STILL CONSIDER PICKING ONE OF
 THE NEWER STAGE PUBLIC COMPANIES
 LIKE A PINTEREST OR ZOOM OR
 LYFT
 FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT TAKING
 THE BLAME OF BLUE APRON.
 I'M MANY BLAMING JIM CRAMER WHO
 SAID --
 DON'T THROW CRAMER UNDER THE
 BUS!
 CRAMER WIPED ME OUT
 I'M GOING BACK TO MY ROOTS
 MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS BEST PICKS
 WILL BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
 LIST, WE KNOW THAT'S AN OUTRAGE,
 BUT I WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO
 CRAWL BACK FROM THE BASEMENT
 HERE AND CRUSH SEYMOUR, CRUSH
 HIM, FOR THIS IMPETULANCE.
 THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
 I WILL TELL YOU, WE HAVE A
 PERIOD FOR THE STOCK TO GO
 THROUGH THE DISCUSSION OF THE
 TRANSITION
 WE KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
 OVERNIGHT BUT I THINK THERE'S
 BEEN A CASE YOU CAN SEE
 SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.
 BUT THAT'S THE TIME OF A
 RERATING STORY THAT IS AT LEAST
 OPPORTUNISTIC IN THIS
 ENVIRONMENT.
 EXACTLY.
 YOU KNOW, SO MUCH OF THIS IS
 ABOUT TIMING
 BECAUSE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN,
 KEVIN, YOU WON, ONE OF THE
 STOCKS THAT WEIGHED DOWN
 CHARLES' WAY WAS AMD
 HE WAS IN LAST PLACE THAT YEAR
 THE NEXT YEAR, THE THIRD PICK OF
 NICK LOWERY'S CHOICES WAS AMD,
 AND THAT WAS THE STOCK THAT MADE
 HIM THE WINNER LAST YEAR
 SO THE LAST SHALL BE FIRST
 SOMETIMES.
 LARRY PUT IT RIGHT THROUGH
 THE UPRIGHTS ON THAT
 I WILL SAY THE SAME THING THE
 YEAR BEFORE, VALENT WAS THE
 WORST STOCK IN THE MARKET FOR
 THE PROCEEDING YEAR AND NUMBER
 ONE PERFORMER FOR ME
 I THINK YOU HAVE TO FIND
 OPPORTUNITIES WHERE COMPANIES
 ARE AT SOME INFLECTION POINT
 EITHER IN THEIR REVENUE MODEL OR
 BALANCE SHEET CLEANUP, THOSE ARE
 THE THINGS THAT WILL MOVE THE
 MOST.
 KEVIN, LAST WORD TO YOU, YOU
 MAKE YOUR COMMISSIONER TO THE
 APPEAL HERE WITH
 I'M GOING TO BRING MY BEST
 GAME, OBVIOUSLY.
 THIS HAS BECOME VERY IMPORTANT
 TO ALL OF US
 WHO KNEW THE LEAGUE WOULD BECOME
 SO IMPORTANT
 BUT I'M NOT PLANNING ON LOSING
 EVER SIN SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
 JUST PERMANENTLY PRINT MY NAME
 AND THAT TROPHY.
 I'M COMING IN TO GET IT.
 YOU WILL NOT EVEN TOUCH THAT,
 SEYMOUR.
 THIS IS VERY PERSONAL
 VERY PERSONAL.
 NEXT THURSDAY 2:00 ON "POWER
 LUNCH," WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN
 ALL YEAR WATCHING THE BIG
 SMACKDOWN.
 THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.
