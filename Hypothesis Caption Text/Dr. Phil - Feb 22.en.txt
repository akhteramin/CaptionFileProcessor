Or I can talk to my gynecologist today! You didn't choose to have endometriosis... but you can choose to ask if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA is specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. In clinical trials, ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 common types of endometriosis pain, painful periods, pelvic pain in between periods, and pain with sex. Don't use ORILISSA if you are or may be pregnant, have osteoporosis, severe liver disease, or are taking drugs like cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. It may cause abnormal liver tests. ORILISSA may change your periods, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. It does not prevent pregnancy. Use birth control that does not contain hormones. ORILISSA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. It may also cause bone loss. Ask your gynecologist if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA. Made for endo pain.

[APPLAUSE] <i>Abdominal Pain? </i> <i>Discomfort? </i> <i> You may be the one in</i> <i> six living with IBS.</i> <i> Ask your doctor about</i> <i> nonprescription</i> <i> IBgard for the daily</i> <i> dietary management of IBS.</i> <i> IBgard 
- Daily</i> <i> Gut Health Gard.</i> I've always been amazed by what's next. And still going for my best, even though I live with a higher risk of stroke due to Afib not caused by a heart valve problem. So if there's a better treatment than warfarin... I want that too. ELIQUIS. ELIQUIS is proven to reduce stroke risk better than warfarin. Plus has significantly less major bleeding than warfarin. ELIQUIS is FDA-approved and has both. What's next? Reeling in a nice one. <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i> <i>as stopping increases your risk</i> <i> of having a stroke.</i> <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i> <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i> <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i> <i> an artificial heart valve</i> <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i> <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i> <i> you may bruise more easily</i> <i> and it may take longer than</i> <i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i> <i> Seek immediate medical care</i> <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i> <i> like unusual bruising.</i> <i> ELIQUIS may increase your</i> <i> bleeding risk</i> <i> if you take certain medicines.</i> <i> Tell your doctor</i> <i> about all planned medical</i> <i> or dental procedures.</i> ELIQUIS, the number one cardiologist-prescribed blood thinner. Ask your doctor if ELIQUIS is what's next for you. <i> Stronger is blasting</i> <i> her tumors...</i> <i> without risking her bones.</i> <i> It's training her</i> <i> good cells...</i> <i> to fight the bad guys.</i> <i> Stronger is less pain...</i> <i> new hope...</i> <i> more fight.</i> <i> It's doing everything</i> <i> in your power...</i> <i> and everything in ours.</i> <i> Stronger, is changing even</i> <i> faster than they do.</i> <i> Because we don't just want</i> <i> your kids to grow up.</i> <i> We want them to</i> <i> grow up stronger.</i>
