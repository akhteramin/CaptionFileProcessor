 FIRST LETS GET OVER TO WUSA 9 METEOROLOGIST HOWARD BERNSTEIN FOR AN UPDATE ON THE FLASH FLOOD WARNING WERE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING.
 WEVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME FLOODING RIGHT NOW.
 THESE ARE FLOOD WARNINGS FROM FREDERICK INTO SOUTHERN GEORGE COUNTY.
 THESE ARE THE WORST MOST DANGEROUS TYPE OF FLOODING AND HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY.
 IT ONLY TAKES A FOOT TWO FEET OF WATER TO PUSH YOUR CAR OFF THE ROAD SO THATS WHY YOU HEAR TURNED AROUND DONT DROWN.
 EVEN HOWARD COUNTY UNDER A FLASH FLOOD COUNTY UNTIL 1145.
 AND MONTGOMERY SEEING SOME HEAVY RAIN. MERI AND I WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PRESIP INTENSITY IN THE FIVE PLUS INCHES PER HOUR SO THESE ARE TROPICAL DOWNPOURS CAUSING SOME FLASH FLOODING BUT A NUMBER OF WATER RESCUES IN FREDERICK AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY.
 I66 SOUTH SEEMS TO BE THE HEAVIEST.
 YOURE STARTING TO SEE HEAVY RAIN MOVE IN AND EVERYWHERE ORANGE AND RED VERY VERY HEAVY RAINFALL FROM FedEx FIELD ACROSS THE HEART OF D.C. MOVING TOWARDS THE HEART OF ALEXANDRIA.
 OUR FRIENDS IN MT.
 VERNON AND PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY GENERALLY SOUTH OF JOINT BASE ANDREWS GET READY AS THIS WHOLE MASS OF WATER IS MOVING TOWARDS YOU WITH THE FLASH FLOOD WARNING UNTIL 1115 AND WERE GOING TO SEE BETTER WEATHER.
 ONCE WE GET RID OF THE STUFF THIS MORNING WELL SEE THE ACTIVITY SHIFT OFF TO THE SOUTH AND WEST AS WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON.
 THE NEXT ONE TO TWO HOURS COULD BE PARTICULARLY BAD TWO FLOODING BUT IT WILL GET BETTER THIS AFTERNOON.
 I HOPE SO.
 THIS IS A LIVE LOOK AT THE BELTWAY.
 WE HAD A CLOSURE.
 THEY JUST OPENED A 2 LEFT LANE ON THE INNER LOOP BY THE AMERICAN LEGION BRIDGE.
 THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS A TREE THAT FELL ON TO A VEHICLE AND CAUSED SOME SORT OF ACCIDENT.
 THEYRE TRYING TO MOVE IT OVER TO THE RIGHT HAND SIZE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THATS THE INNER LOOP OF THE BELTWAY COMING FROM THE SPRINGFIELD INTERCHANGE.
