 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE DR. DREW.
 WE BEGIN WITH A STORY WEVE BEEN TRACKING.
 HE JUSSIES REPS SAID CHICAGO PD FIND HIS STORY CONSISTENT AND CREDIBLE.
 THIS COME HAS DAY AFTER A SPOKESPERSON SAID THE KNOWN RECORDS DO NOT MEET THE BURDEN FOR A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HAS THEY WERE LIMITED AND HEAVILY REACTED.
 JUSSIES REPS CLAIM INFORMATION WAS REMOVED TO PROVENT OTHERS WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ATTACK.
 CHECK OUT THIS TEASER.
 AT ANY POINT DURING THE ATTACK DID YOU FEAR FOR YOUR ATTACK?
 YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING IT.
 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THE NARRATIVE?
 ITS NOT OUR JOB TO CREATE A NARRATIVE.
 IF HE HAS OVERSTATED IT IM STILL WORRIED.
 SO ALL OF US SIT BACK.
 ITS NOT OUR BUSINESS.
 TORY YOU HAVE A STRONG TAKE. INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
 IF ITS NOT TRUE DR. DREW IS RIGHT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING ELSE WRONG.
 WE HAVENT SEEN ANYTHING.
 I MEAN TOM BRADY DIDNT GIVE UP HIS PHONE WHEN ITS DEFLATE GATE AND WERE JUMPING ON THIS GUY.
 ANYTHING WE GET FROM THE STORY WILL PUSH THE NARRATIVE.
 THERES MONEY TO BE MADE FROM DIVISION.
 UNFORTUNATELY ITS THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.
 THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS SAY YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A HOAX PARKLAND SANDY HOOK PIZZA GATE.
 EVERYBODY UNFORTUNATELY HAS A FINANCIAL INTEREST.
 I GUARANTEE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT FANS OF HIS AND DO CARE ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL WELLBEING.
 THEY JUST SEE THE KID AS A WAY IT FURTHER THEIR AGENDA.
 I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF YOU THINK THERE ARE HOLES IN HIS STORY WHICH I DONT WAIT FOR THE INTERVIEW.
 WE WILL BE COVERING THE INTERVIEW TOMORROW.
 THE MEDIA CREATES NARRATIVE.
 THOSE HEADLINES THATS FOR THE GOOD OF THE NARRATIVE.
 THEY WANT IT MAKE MONEY.
 BE AN INDIVIDUAL THINKER AND CHIME IN DBL NATION.
 WE FINALLY HAVE GOOD NEWS COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON D.C. MANY.
 WE ARE TWO DAYS AWAY FROM A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS CAME UP WITH A TENTATIVE DEAL.
 SOURCES SAY HE IS EXPECTED TO SIGN IT.
 IN THE MEANTIME TED CRUZ IS BACKING ANOTHER PLAN.
 CRUZ SAID WE SHOULD USE THE MONEY U.S. PROSECUTORS ARE SEEKING FROM NOW CONVICTED EL CHAPO.
 THEYRE SEEKING 14 BILLION IN PROFLTS AND CRUZ SAID THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TOWARD SECURITY BORDER.
 WELL WE HAVE A NEW TO DOG.
 MEET KING THE FOX TERRIER.
 I CALLED IT THE BEST IN SHOW LAMPS NIGHT AT THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW.
 COMPETITION WAS ROUGH. THE FOX TERRIER WON THE TOP PRIZE.
 THIS MARKS THE 15th TIME THAT BREED HAS COME OUT ON TOP.
 THE LONG HAIRED DACHSHUND DID NOT WIN.
 AND THE SKIPPER WHO WON THE NONSPORTING GROUP WAS DISQUALIFIED. SCANDAL.
 DUE TO A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
 I THOUGHT I WAS BACK IN FRANCE.
 AND THIS SUSSEX SPANIEL NAMED BEAN WHO WON THE SPORTING GROUP AND MEET WILMA THE BOXER BUT IT WASNT JUST US HUMANS.
 CHECK OUT ALL THESE DOGS WHO REALLY GOT INTO THE ACTION.
 TORY I KNOW FIRST OF ALL SCANDAL.
 BIG SCANDAL.
 SKIPPER KEY WAS IN IT.
 THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH THE JUDGE AND SAID I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.
 THAT IS SCANDAL AM I RIGHT?
 I DONT KNOW.
 BECAUSE THE JUDGE WAS A CO OWNER OF SAID DOG.
 SHOULDNT THAT BE ILL LOCAL?
 THIS WAS.
 HE DID A NICE LAUGH AND WALKED.
 THE BEARDED GUY THAT LOOKS LIKE SHERLOCKS HE LOOKS LIKE A DOG.
 AT SOME POINT THAT DOG WAS ON. HE STOOD LIKE THIS AND HE THE CROWD.

 THIS IS IMPORTANT.
 ONE PERSON MY BEDROOM LIFE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND SUCKS. THREE TIME AS WEEK IF IM LUCKY. THREE TIMES A WEEK ABOVE AVERAGE BY THE WAY.
 THATS ABOVE AVERAGE?
 YES. AVERAGE IN A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP. WHAT ABOUT A NEW RELATIONSHIP.
 SOME PEOPLE ARE AT THAT RATE. THATS FOR SURE.
 PEOPLE HAVE TO REACH A COMPROMISE.
 MORNING AND NIGHT JEFF. I LOVE SLEEP. ITS ABOUT COMPROMISING. YOU HAVE TO TELL HER THIS IS NOT YOUR RATE AND YOU HAVE TO STEP IT UP.
 ONE OF THE THINGS I SEE COMMONLY IN YOUNG COUPLES WHEN A FEMALE SEXUAL DESIRE DOES NOT MATCH A MAN SHE MAY BE ON A HIGH PROJEST TER PRONE BIRTH CONTROL.
 SO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIRTH CONTROL. THE PROGESTERONE.
 THIS GUY. HES LIKE A FOUNTAIN OF KNOWLEDGE. ELLIE SAYS MY HUSBAND GAMBLES COMPULSIVELY AND FREQUENTS GENTLEMENS CLUBS. WE ARE DROWNING IN DEBT. SHOULD I WALK OUT. ELLIE MAE LIKE FROM THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES? THIS IS A TRAGEDY AND THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW REAL GAMBLING ADDICTION DESTROYS LIFE.
 THERE COULD BE SEXUAL ADDICTION. TREVOR IN TAMPA SAID MY GIRLFRIEND GETS MAD AT ME FOR NOT POSTING PICTURES OF US ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
 GO TO ALANON. I LIKE TO POST ABOUT MY HOBBIES SHE THINKS IM HIDING SOMETHING.
 THERES SPECIFIC ONES FOR GAMBLING AND SEX ACTS BUT AL ANONIS EASY TO FIND. I HAVE TO FINISH DOES HE GO TO GA GAMBLINGS ANONYMOUS. OR SEX ACTS AEN IN ANONYMOUS.
 HE GETS TREATMENT OR YOU LEAVE. ANOTHER WE BOTH PEOPLE STRONGLY. SHES NOT READY FOR A RELATIONSHIP. WE CANT STOP SEEING EACH OTHER. IT FEELS LIKE A REBOUND. WHEN SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE YOURE MORE OF A LIFE PRESERVER WHEN SOMEONES GOING THROUGH A HORRIBLE CRISIS. I WOULD NEED A WHOLE LOT MORE INFORMATION.
 COULD IT WORK OUT? I COULD BUT I HAVE BAD FEELINGS ABOUT THIS. INTERESTING. I JUST READ RUTH.
 THATS A RELATABLE ONE.
 YOU SIR NEED TO STEP UP BECAUSE SHES LETTING YOU KNOW SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT COULD MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY. IM MOSTLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU AND SAM JEFF. WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOVE NORMAL IN CERTAIN AREAS. I GET THAT A LOT. FIVE MINUTES AGO. TODAYS WATCH AND WIN WORD IS SUNGLASSES. WELCOME BACK TO DBL. ALL MONTH LONG IM TALKING WITH TV LEGENDS FROM THE PAST TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE NOW.
