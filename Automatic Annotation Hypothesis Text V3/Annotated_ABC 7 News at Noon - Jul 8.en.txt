 LATEST.Reporter IT WILL BE THE SHOW OF A LIFETIME PRESIDENT TRUMP Reporter IT WILL BE THE SHOW OF A LIFETIME PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PROMISED ON TWITTER AHEAD OF HRAVAGANT FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
 A COSTLY PRODUCTION THAT TRUMP HAS ALSO PROMISED WILL BE WORTH THE EXPENSE WITH AN ARRAY OF MILITARY HARDWARE ON DISPLAY THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL INCLUDING TANKS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN USHERED IN THE SALUTE TO AMERICA SPECTACLE WILL ALSO INCLUDE MULTIPLE MILITARY FLYOVERS AND AN EXTENDED FIREWORKS SHOW TOPPED OFF WITH A SPEECH FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HIMSELF.
 WE WILL HAVE PLANES GONG OVERHEAD THE BEST FIGHTER JETS IN THE WORLD AND OTHER PLANES THE EVENT IS SETTING OF MORE THAN PYROTECHNIC DEVICES BUT IT IS ALSO SPARKING BACKLASH FROM CRITICS WHO ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF STAGING GLORIFIED CAMPAIGN RALLY AND TURNING THE CELEBRATION INTO A PARTISAN EVENT.
 THE EVENT IS FREE BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS GIVEN VIP TICKETS TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND TOP DONORS BUT CARSON AND 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SETH MOULTON CALLING THE TRUMP CELEBRATION UNAMERICAN.
 IT REMINDS ME OF THE SOVIET UNION.

 WITH A REMINDER THIS INDEPENDENT SAY THAT FIREWORKS ARE NOT TOYS BUT THEY NEED TO BE USED PROPERLY.
 CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION ALWAYS DO THESE LIMITATIONS ON THE NATIONAL MALL THIS IS WHAT THEY DID LAST WEEK WITH COLETTE LIKE TO DO THESE DEMONSTRATIONS TO SHOW HOW QUICKLY THINGS CAN GO WRONG WHEN FIREWORKS ARE NOT HANDLED PROPERLY.

 WE ARE MONITORING THAT IN OF COURSE WE WILL HAVE SOME VIDEO FOR YOU LATER. PLUS.Lindsey THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS HITTING RIVERS ON Lindsey THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS HITTING RIVERS ON HIS COURSE OF THIS CENSUS ASSISTANTSHIP QUESTION.
 COMING UP NEXT AT NOON. IT IS PROBABLY THE LARGE DISPLAY OF STARS AND STRIPES YOU SEE THIS HOLIDAY WITH FIND OUT WHERE THIS IS. PLUS. WEEK REMOVED SUPREME COURT DECISION BLOCKING DEMONSTRATION FROM ADDING A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE 2020 CENSUS.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOTIFIED JOINING THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS EVEN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. THAT MESSAGE CONTRADICTING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CENSUS FORMS ARE BEING PRINTED WITHOUT THE QUESTION ARE YOU A U.S. CITIZEN.
 I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY IS A CITIZEN AS OPPOSED TO AN ILLEGAL.
 WHAT A PERSON IS INSISTENT THAT THE FIGHT FOR THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS ONGOING HIS COMMENTS HAVE SPARKED CONFUSION. MARYLAND FEDERAL JUDGE CONVENED A CONFERENCE CALL ON WAS AFTER SHE SAW THE PRESENCE TO SAYING THAT REPORTS THAT THE QUESTION HAD BEEN DROPPED OR FAKE. ON THE CALL THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN THE PRESIDENTS RHETORIC BUT WHENWE ARE SICK THE TWEET THIS ONE WAS THE FIRST I HAD HEARD OF THE PRESIDENTS POSITION ON THIS ISSUE. I DO NOT HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT MEANS AT THIS JUNCTURE OTHER THAN WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID ADMIT THAT THE PRESIDENT CONTRADICTED THEM  BUT SAID THEY HAVE BEEN STARTED TO EXPLORE WHETHER THERE IS A PATH FOR CONSISTENT WITH THE SUPREME COURT TO ALLOW THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY ARGUED THEY NEEDED THE CENSUS QUESTION TO BETTER ENFORCE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SHOT DOWN THAT LINE OF THINKING CONTROL AND WOULD.
 THE COURT RULED THAT THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WAS NOT ABOUT WHATEVER COCKAMAMIE REASON THAT DONALD TRUMP GAVE FOR IT. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS FOLLOWING THE PRESENCE INSTRUCTIONS THEY ARE RUNNING LOW ON TIME. THE ONLY HAVE UNTIL TOMORROW TO EXPAND TO THE COURTS HOW THEY PLAN TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURTS RULING. TREVOR AULT ABC NEWS WASHINGTON.

 ALL OF YOU HEADED TO THE BEACH THIS FOURTH OF JULY. PARENTS IF YOU DO NOT REMIND YOUR KIDS ODDS ARE THEY MAY NOT BE PUTTING IT ON AT ALL BUT AND WHEN THEY DID ARE THEY APPLYING ENOUGH? BECKY REALLY HAS THE EYEOPENING SUNSCREEN EXPERIMENT.
 I DONT NEED IT. I GET ANNOYED.
 SUNSCREEN IS A KEEP IT.
 IT IS QUITE ANNOYING. PARENTS KNOW IT IS A MUST. THE ONE BLISTERING SUMMER IS EXTERIOR TO LIVE LIFE SOME CANCERS WITH MULTISTATE ALL SKIN TONES SHOULD WEAR SUNSCREEN REGULARLY PAST RESEARCH SHOWS FOR INTENT DO NOT. WHY?
 I SUBMIT THIS REENACTMENT FROM MY DAUGHTER.
 PUT ON SUNSCREEN.
 NO I DONT WANT TO PUT ON SUNSCREEN!
 IT IS A BATTLE.
 HOLLY A FORMER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER AND FOUNDER OF HER OWN SUNSCREEN COMPANY SUPER GRP YSTHERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE.
 IF YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BRUSH HER TEETH AND WASH HER HANDS YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO DO YOUR OWN SUNSCREEN.
 REALLY?
 LETS TRY IT.
 WE ARE USING A SPECIAL CAMERA FITTED WITH A YOU BE SPENCER.
 WHEN SOMETHING GOES ON IT SHOWS THAT IT IS BLACK AND HOW IS ANY MISSED SPOTS.
 WE START WITH b79 TO SEE IF TH APPLICATION IS THOROUGH.
 BECAUSE PUT IT ON AND IT WILL REVIEW WHAT THEY MISSED.
 AS EACH OF THESE CHILDREN APPLIED NONE OF THEM HIT THE YEARS AND THE YEARS ARE ACTUALLY VERY VULNERABLE TO SUN DAMAGE.
 AND OTHER FREQUENT MISS.
 ILDREN FORGET TO PUT IT RIGHT ON INTO THE HAIRLINE.
 SOMETHING ALL THE YOUNGER KIDS STRUGGLED WITH NOT USING ENOUGH SUNSCREEN.
 WHAT YOU SEE?
 I MISSED A LOT OF SPOTS.
 SHE SAID THEY CAN KIDS ARE AFRAID OF GETTING SUNSCREEN IN THEIR MOUTH OR EYES BUT.
 WE ARE MISSING A FEW CRITICAL SPOTS RIGHT AROUND THE EYE AREA WHICH IS OFTEN WHERE SUN DAMAGE IS FIRST DETECTED FROM AN AGING AND SKIN CANCER PERSPECTIVE.
 A STUDY SHOWED KIDS USING ONE QUARTER OF THE AMOUNT OF SUNSCREEN NEEDED TO GET THE MUCH PROTECTION LIST ON THE BOTTLE.OVING TO THE OLDER GROUP OF 11 TO 12YEAROLD THE DEPUTY THEY WERE MUCH MORE CONSISTENT.
 DEVON IS A LOT OF SUNSCREEN AND ALSO GUSTS ALSO AN 11YEAROLD WHO SEEM TO GET THE WATER.
