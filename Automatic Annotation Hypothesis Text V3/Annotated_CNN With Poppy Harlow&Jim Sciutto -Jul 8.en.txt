 MANEUVER INTO SOME SORT OF TALKS THAT WOULD BE THE BEST POSITION FOR THEM. OKAY.
 KIM BER LE THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERTISE.
 APPRECIATE IT.
 ALL RIGHT. IT IS THE TOP OF THE HOUR.
 GOOD MONDAY MORNING.
 IM IN NEW YORK. HES ACCUSED OF SEEKING OUT MINERS AND PAYING CASH TO GIRLS AS YOUNG AS 14 YEARS OLD AND THEN PAYING THEM TO RECRUIT OTHER GIRLS FOR HIM TO ABU ANUND IN PUBLIC.CHARGES WILL BE A PRESS CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD WITH PROSECUTORS AND THE FBI AND LATER THIS MORNING EPSTEIN WILL APPEAR IN COURT. OUR ANCHOR AND NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT ERICA HILL IS ME COURTHOUSE.
 WE BEGIN WITH THIS HOUR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE JUST UNSEALED AN INDICTMENT AGAINST JEFFREY EP TEEN. STILL UNKNOWN WHAT THIS CASE COULD REVEAL ABOUT HIS POLITICAL CONNTIS AND THEY INCLUDE A BRITISH ROYAL A PRESIDENT AND THE CURRENT ONE EPSTEIN QUOTE A TERRIFIC GUY. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING.
 INSIDE IT THE ALARMING DETAILS OF HOW THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED BILLIONAIRE ALLEGEDLY RAN A SEX TRAFFICKING RING. SHIMON Y HELDRE ND ADEY ENCOUNT ESCALATED.
 AND SOME OF THE GIRLS SAYING  IN SOME OF JULIE BROWNS REPORTING WE SHOULD POINT OUT. THE ALLEGED VICTIMS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DIDNT KNOW IT WAS GOING TO MAYBE GO THAT WAY.
 OR THEY KNEW IT WASNT RIGHT BUT AGAIN THEY WERE YOUNG AND DIDNT GET IT.
 AND IT ALSO POINTS OUT IN THE INDICTMENT THAT THEY BELIEVE PROSECUTORS BELIEVE HE DID KNOW THEIR AGES AND WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE SOME OF THESE VICTIMS WHO WERE IN HERE WERE ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THEIR AGE AND THEY SAID THEY DIDNT LIE.
 LETS TALK ABOUT THE POWERFUL PEOPLE IN POLITICS THAT WERE FRIENDS INCLUDING PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WHICH I THINK RECORDS SHOW FLEW ON HIS JET SEVERAL TIMES.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS QUOTED WITH GLOWING WORDS ABOUT HIM BACK IN NAIN FACT.
 IN 2002 HE TALKED ABOUT HIM TO NEW YORK MAGAZINE HE SAID HES A TERRIFIC GUY HES A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH.
 ITS EVEN SAID THAT HE LIKES BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AS MUCH AS I DO AND MANY OF THEM ARE ON THE YOUNGER SIDE.
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT JEFFREY ENJOYS HIS SOCIAL LIGHT.
 OBVIOUSLY THATS SEEN IN A FAR DIFFERENT LIGHT TODAY.
 BUT THERE IS A CONNECTION HERE.
 YOU MENTIONED FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON FLYING ON HIS PLANE BEING ON HIS PRIVATE ISLAND.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY ON HIS PLANE.
 AND AT ONE POINT EP TEEN WAS A MEMBER OF MARALAGO AND HAD BEEN THERE BUT WAS BARRED AT ONE POINT.
 HE WAS ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING AN UNDERAGE GIRL THERE.
 I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO BRING UP WITH YOU THE CURRENT LABOR SECRETARY ALEXANDER ACOSTA WHO IS VERY TIED TO THIS BECAUSE HE WAS A PART OF SECURING THE SWEET PLEA DEAL FOR EPSTEIN BACK IN 2008 THAT GOT HIM VERY LITTLE JAIL TIME CHARGED WITH PROSTITUTION NOT SEX TRAFFICKING AND BY THE WAY THAT NONE OF THE VICTIMS KNEW ABOUT. NO.
 THEY DIDNT. SO A COUPLE OF POINTS THERE.
 NUMBER ONE YOURE RIGHT.
 ALEXANDER ACOSTA AT THE TIME WAS THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT SO HE HAD TO OVERSEE THIS DEAL.
 HE TO SAY OKAY WITH TEAM OF ATTORNEYS.
 AT THE TIME HE SAID THEY LACKED THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD VIOLATED FEDERAL LIEU.
 THERES BEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON THAT SINCE.
 WELL THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING HOW THE CASE WAS HANDLE.
 WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN FEBRUARY A FEDERAL JUDGE SAID THIS DEAL BROKE THE LAW BECAUSE THE VICTIMS DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
 THE TERMS OF THIS DEAL WHICH ITS BEEN SAID MULTIPLE TIMES WERE BASICALLY DICTATED BY EPSTEINS ATTORNEYS POWERFUL ATTORNEYS THEY DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
 THE DEAL WAS KEPT QUIET AND KEPT APART FROM THE VICTIMS UNTIL A JUDGE SIGNED OFF ON IT.
 YOU CANT DO THAT. THAT BROKE THE LAW.
 GREAT REPORTING.
 OBVIOUSLY WELL BE ON THIS ALL DAY BECAUSE HES GOING TO BE IN COURTHIS MORNING.
 LETS TALK ABOUT WHERE THIS GORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IS HERE.ARE A G VOICE THIS BECAUSE YOUE ACTUALLY PROSECUTED SEX TRAFFICKING CASES BEFORE.
 ONE THING THAT SHIMON SAID OUTSIDHEOURTENTS AGO THAT STRUCK ME IS THAT WHAT MAY BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAN THE PLEA DEAL IN 2008 IF THIS GOES TO TRIAL IS THAT THEY HAE THREE COOPERATORS AND THOSEORE APPARENTLY SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARRANGED THE TRAVEL OF THE UNDERAGE GIRLS TO BE WITH EPSTEIN.
 HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT?
 WELL ITS IMPORTANT.
 I MEAN FRANKLY I THINK THE CASE IS GOING TO RISE AND FALL FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ON THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE COOPERATORS.
 THESE CASES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO INVESTIGATE. THEYRE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE.
 OFTEN MINORS WHO ARE ABUSED HAVE DIFFICULTY COMING FORWARD AND TESTIFYING.
 THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY GOING THROUGH AND DOING WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO TO BE A I A CASE.
 SO REALLY HERE THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE HAS TO BE STRONG IN ORDER FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT TO MAKE ITS CASE IN COURT.
 AND WHAT I THINK THIS INDICTMENT TELLS US IS THAT THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE TESTIMONY THAT CAN BACK THESE CHARGES UP.
 WHEN YOU DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK THAT RAISED SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT THE VICTIMS DIDNT KNOW ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE NOW NOT ONLY FOR ALEXANDER ACOSTA THE LABOR SECRETARY WHO WAS A BIG PART OF THIS BUT THE JUDGE WHO SIGNED OFF ON IT?
 YEAH I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT MR. ACOSTAS ACTS THERE.
 REALLY THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT BEHINDTHESCENES THAT CAUSED THAT SERIES OF EVENTS.
 THERES CLEARLY MISCONDUCT BY NOT INFORMING VICTIMS.
 IT APPEARS AT SOME POINT THERE WERE MISREPRESENTATIONS THAT WERE MADE TO THE COURT.
 VERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS.
 PARTICULARLY IN CASES LIKE THIS WHEN I DID INVESTIGATE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES THOSE VICTIMS ARE COUNTING ON YOU AS A PROSECUTOR.
 THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO YOU AND THEY ARE COUNTING ON YOU TO PROSECUTE AND ACT FAIRLY.
 ANDT IS INTERESTING THAT THE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS WORKING ON THIS THAT ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN A LITTLE UNDER AN HOUR ARE FROM THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORKS PUBLIC CORRUPTION UNIT.
 WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
 COULD BE THEYUST HAVE TIME E THEIR PLATES.
 BUT IT ALSO COULD MEAN THAT THERES SOME TIE TOHIS CASE EITHER FROM THE ANGLE YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT OR ANOTHER THERES ON POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION PROVISION.
 PERHAPS THERE IS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL THAT COULD THAT IS AT LEAST INVOLVED IN T CASE OUE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 ALSO THIS MORNING AS MORE IMAGES AND REPORTS OFHUMANE COE MIGRANT FIEM BORDER THE PR SAYS HE NOW WANTS THE MEDIA TO GO INSIDE AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES.
 KAITLYN US FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
 GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
 KAITLYN THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS THIS BUT THERES A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING THAT AND THE FACILITIES ACTUALLY LETTING IN JOURNALISTS WITH CAMERASUNANNOUNCED.
 SO FAR THEYVE BEEN HESITANT NOT WANTAWMAKERS TO BRING THEIR PHONES INTO THE FACILITIES.
 SO WHETHER OR NOT THAT INVITATION ISNG TO GO FORWARD IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION.
 BUT SO FAR THE PRESIDENT AND HI REPORTS ABOUT THESE CONDITIONS AT THE BORDER.
 HERES WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY.
 IM GOING TO START SHOWING SOME OF THESE DETENTION CENTERS TO THE PRESS.
 THEYRE CROWDED AND WERE THE ONES WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEYRE CROWDED.
 SO THE PRESIDENT THERE GOING AFTER NOT ONLY SOME OF THOSE DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTING WHAT THEY SAW WHEN THEYVE TOURED THESE FACILITIES.
 WE SHOULD NOTE ITS NOT JUST ONE SINGULAR REPORT DETAILING THESE CONDITIONS THAT THEY SAY ARE WIDESPREAD AT THESE FACILITIES.
 OVERCROWDING AND STANDING ROOM ONLY.
 PEOPLE GOING WITHOUT HOT MEALS.
 ITS COMING FROM A REPORT FROM THE PRESIDENTS OWN GOVERNMENT AND A VERY SPECIFIC IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND PEOPLE SHOULD READ.
 AND NATASHA YOURE THERE AND YOU SPOKE TO A REP WHO SAYS BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR SOME TIME TO BRING THESE CONDITIONS TO LIGHT.
 THATS RIGHT POPPY.
 WE WERE TALKING TO REPRESENTATIVE MARY GONE SQUALL ES. SHE REPRESENTS THE AREA WHERE THE FACILITY IS.
 SHE SAYS THAT LOCAL LEADERS LIKE HERSELF AND THE COMMUNITY DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WERE BEING PROCESSED THROUGH THAT FACILITY UNTIL NEWS REPOS CAME OUT IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO ABOUT THE CONDITIONS INSIDE.
 SHE SAID THAT SOME OF THESE ATROL AGENTS WHOA LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY WAVE KNOWN HER FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING HER ABOUT HOW DEMORALIZING AND SDPRESING IT IS TO WORK IN THE CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE SEEING DAY TO DAY WITH THE MIGRANTS.
 THEYVE ALSO TOLD HER ABOUT HOW HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN AT ONE POINT WERE BEING PROCESSED THROUGH THAT FACILITY IN A SPACE THATS REALLY NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT MANY KIDS AND BEING HELD THERE FOR LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD BE THERE WITH LIMITED SHOWER AND SHOWER FACILITIES TO WASH UP LIMITED MICROWAVES TO HEAT FOOD TO FEED THEM.
 HERES WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HER CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE AGENTS.
 A LOT OF THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO WHO WORKED THERE WERE SAYING WE HAVE BEEN TELLING HIGHERUPS THERES A PROBLEM.
 AND BASICALLY THOSE PLEAS HAVE BEEN IGNORED.
 A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO I TALKED TO HAVE BEEN IN THE BORDER PATROL FOR DECADES 23 YEARS 24 YEARS. THIS IS SOMETHING VERY NEW TO THEM.
 THEY WERE NEVER CHARGED WITH BEING CARE TAKERS OF CHILDREN.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT MY COMMUNITY IS STRUGGLING WITH AN ADMINISTRATIONMADE PROBLEM.
 AND GONZALEZ DID SAY THAT SHE GOT TO VISIT INSIDE THE CLINT FACILITY LAST WEEK WHEN THERE WERE FAR FEWER CHILDREN.
 MANY OF THEM HAVE NOW BEEN PROCESSED OUT.
 WE DID ALSO HEAR FROM THE SECTOR CHIEF OF THE EL PASO REGION WHO SAID NOW IN THIS REGION THEY HAVE ONLY 26 CHILDREN IN CUSTODY.
 HE DISPUTES THEORTS OF THE INHUMANE CONDITIONS INSIDE BUT HE DOES ACKNOWLEDGE ITS VERY POSSIBLE AGENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT CONDITIONS AND OVERCROWDING IN THE PAST.
 HE SAYS THEYVE ALL BEEN COMPLAINING THAT THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY CHILDREN AND NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO PROCESS THEM THROUGH.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE REPORTING FOR TALKING TO HER.
 WE APPRECIATE IT.
 STILL TO COME THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS TAKING A NEW STRATEGY AS IT PUSHES TO TRY TO GET A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE UPCOMING CENSUS.
 PLUS NEW FIGHTING WORDS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI TAKES ON CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA OCASCIOCORTEZ AND LATER THE U.S. WOMEN AREEADING HOME WITH ANORLD CUP TITLE AND READY TO TAKE ON A BIGGER BATTLE EQUAL PAY.

 Wrinkles just wont.
 Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repairs dermproven retinol works so fast it takes only one week to reveal younger looking skin. THATS RIGHT THIS WILL BE A NEW TEAM THAT WILL NOW HAVE TO PUSH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF ARGUMENTS TO TRY TO GET THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE 2020 CENSUS. AND WEVE LEARNED THAT THE POLITICAL APPOINTEE WHO LED THE INITIAL TEAM OF LAWYERS DID IN FACT THINK THAT IT MADE SENSE TO GET A NEW TEAM OF LAWYERS ON BOARD BECAUSE THEYRE REALLY DOING AN ABOUTFACE HERE AND ITS A FLIPFLOP THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FORCED BY THE PRESIDENT. REMEMBER IT WAS LESS THAN A WEEK AGO THAT THIS FIGHT SEEMED TO BE OVER. LAWYERS FROM THE DOJS FEDERAL PROGRAMS BRANCH TOLD THE CHALLENGERS TO THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION THAT THE CENSUS WAS GOING TO PRINT WITHOUT THE CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION. AND THEN THOSE LAWYERS TOLD A JUDGE THAT THE DIVISION WAS FINAL BUT THEN OF COURSE WE SAW THAT FLURRY OF TWEETS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND HE INSISTED THAT HE WOULD PUSH HIS ADMINISTRATION TO FIND A WAY TO ADD THIS QUESTION. NOW DOJ LAWYERS ADMITTED JUST LAST WEEK TO A MARYLAND JUDGE IN A HEARING ON WEDNESDAY THAT THEY WERE REALLY BLINDSIDED BY THE PRESIDENTS TWEETS. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DOJ HAS BEEN INSISTING ALL ALONG THAT A JULY 1st DEADLINE TO PRINT THE CENSUS WAS THE ABSOLUTE DROP DEAD DEADLINE. AND NOW ALL INDICATIONS THAT THE DOJ IS CONTINUING TO PRESS FORWARD TO FIND A RATIONALE TO ADD THIS QUESTION.
 Making wrinkles look so last week. SO EVEN AFTER THE SUPREME COURT ADMINISTRATION SEES IT AS IMPORTANT THAT THEYRE PUTTING A NEW TEAM OF ATTORNEYS.
 d Wrinkle Repair Pair with new retinol oil for 2X the wrinkle fighting power. Neutrogena NEW TEAM NEW ARGUMENT. AFTER THE SUPREME COURT RULED AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS ATTEMPT TO ADD A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE CENSUS THIS MORNING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS A DIFFERENT TEAM OF LAWYERS WILL NOW TAKE UP THIS BATTLE. FOR MORE ON WHY JESSICA SCHNEIDER OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT IS IN DC. THE SUPREME COURT SAID WHEN THEY MADE THE RULING THAT IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CENSUS BUREAU WENT BACK AND PROVIDED SOME SORT OF RATION THIS QUESTION COULD BE ADDED.
 BUT REALLY IT SEEMS ADMINISTRATION IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME. I GUESS IF THEY WIN ON THIS ARE THEY GOING TO PUT AN INSERT IN CENSUS FOR EVERYONE?
 THEYVE ALREADY GONE PAST THEIR JULY 1st DEADLINE AND NOW THEY COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH IT FORWARD. AND TO YOUR POINT NOT TO MENTION IF THEY COME UP WITH A COMPLETELY NEW RATIONALE AND REASONING WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR WILBUR ROSS TESTIMONY WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE RATIONALE ET CETERA. LOGISTICALLY THATS SORT OF THE BIG QUESTION HERE. THE CENSUS WE KNOW FROM DOJ OFFICIALS IT HAS GONE TO PRINT WITHOUT THAT QUESTION BUT COULD THE ADMINISTRATION SOMEHOW ADD ON A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION BY MAYBE ADDING SUPPLEMENTAL PAGES SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONNAIRES?
 WHO KNOWS IF THEY WOULD SCENE HAVE TIME TO ADD IT.
 HOW WOULD THIS PLAY OUT?
 YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS FLOATED THE IDEA EVEN OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MANDATE THAT THIS QUESTION BE ADDED. JESSICA SCHNEIDER THANK YOU SO MUCH. i Stimulant laxativesi i forcefully stimulatei i the nerves in your colon.i i MiraLAX works withi i the water in youri i body to unblock youri i system naturally.i i And it doesnt causei i bloatingi icramping gasi ior sudden urgency.i i MiraLAX.i i Look for the pink cap.i Youre turning onto the street when you barely clip a passing car. Minor accident no big deal right? Wrong. Your insurance company is gonna raise your rate after the other car got a scratch so small you coulda fixed it with a pen. Maybe you should take that pen and use it to sign up with a different insurance company.
 BUT ALL OF THESE OPTIONS POPPY THEYRE SURE TO FACE THESE CONTINUED LEGAL FIGHTS. WERE ALREADY SEEING IT ON TWO FRONT IN FEDERAL COURTS IN NEW YORK AND MARYLAND HERE. AND OF COURSE WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME BECAUSE WERE LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AWAY FROM 2020 AND THE CENSUS NEEDS TO GET OUT. Im Busy Philipps and Im fearless to face anything. I switched to MiraLAX for my constipation.
 AHEAD FOR US NEW ATTACKS ON NANCY PELOSI NANCY PELOSIS LEADER STYLE. and Clover Flex for when you need to take credit cards when no one carries cash. i For drivers with Accidenti i Forgiveness Liberty Mutuali i wont raise theiri i rates because ofi i their first accident.i i Liberty Mutual Insurance.i  Liberty.
