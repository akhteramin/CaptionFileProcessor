WOW THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
IM FLYING!
REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON I AM LAURA TREVELYAN.
STAY CURIOUS.
APPLAUSE AND NOW BBC WORLD NEWS.
COUNTDOWN TO THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL CALL FOR UNITY IN FRONT OF A DEEPLY DIVIDED CONGRESS.
MR. NEESON ARE YOU SORRY FOR WHAT YOU SAID?
LAURA ACTOR LIAM NEESON SAYS HE IS NO RACIST AFTER HIS DESIRE FOR REVENGE CAUSES AN UPROAR.
VERY FIRST PICTURE I TOOK.
LAURA PLUS DON MCCULLINS CAMERA CAPTURED THE HUMAN COST OF BATTLE.
WE HEAR HOW HE TURNED HIS LENS ON THE HOME FRONT TOO.
LAURA WELCOME TO OUR VIEWERS ON PUBLIC TELEVISION IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE GLOBE.
WASHINGTON IS POISED FOR TONIGHTS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
AIDES SAY HE WILL CALL FOR BIPARTISAN COOPERATION AND UNITY.
BUT MR. TRUMP WILL DELIVER HIS PRIMETIME ADDRESS TO A DIVIDED CONGRESS WHILE STILL SMARTING AFTER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER THE PRESIDENTS CALL FOR A BORDER WALL WITH MEXICO.
KATTY KAY JOINED ME EARLIER.
WHITE HOUSE AIDES HAVE SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT COMITY BUT GIVEN HOW DIVIDED THE TWO SIDES ARE CAN ANYTHING BE ACHIEVED?
KATTY LOOK I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO TONIGHT IS REACH OUT TO VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE WITH SOME SORT OF UNITY AND BIPARTISANSHIP.
WE WILL HEAR THAT TOWNE  TONE.
AND ALSO APPEAL TO HIS BASE WITH A TOUGHER LINE ON IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER WALL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS HE WILL NOT GET A TELEVISION AUDIENCE THIS BIG AGAIN UNTIL THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS WELL UNDERWAY.
JUGGLING THOSE TWO THINGS IS GOING TO BE TRICKY IN TERMS OF TONE AND WE KNOW WHAT IS SAID IN A SPEECH TONIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL COULD VERY QUICKLY BE OVERTURNED WITH ONE TWEET TOMORROW MORNING.
LAURA IT CAN INDEED.
IS THIS LAYING OUT THE BATTLE LINES FOR THE 2020 ELECTION?
KATTY I THINK IT IS.
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS DO AGREE.
I SUSPECT WE WILL HEAR THE PRESIDENT REACH OUT TO DEMOCRATS ON AN ISSUE LIKE THAT.
THE TROUBLE IS THERE IS SO LITTLE TRUST ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THIS PRESIDENT THAT ARE THEY WILLING TO GIVE HIM SOME KIND OF DEAL THAT HE CAN TAKE HOME AND SAY LOOK IVE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING?
THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IN A SENSE IS STARTING RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE ALREADY HAD THOSE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WHO HAVE LAUNCHED THEIR BIDS.
THEY WILL BE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT.
TONIGHT IS HIS BIG AUDIENCE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE HAS ACHIEVED AND WHAT HE CAN STILL ACHIEVE AND THE SPECTACLE OF THIS CROWD CROWNED BY NANCY PELOSI SITTING RIGHT BEHIND HIM THE DEMOCRAT WHO HAS JUST GIVEN HIM A TOUGH TIME TOUGH RUN FOR HIS MONEY OVER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
YOU ARE RIGHT THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS ALL OVER THIS STATE OF THE NOON ADDRESS.
LAURA WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR WHEN YOU SEE NANCY PELOSI THERE THE SYMBOL OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE PRESIDENT?
KATTY IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER IN EVERY SHOT BECAUSE IN THESE STATES OF THE UNIONS YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT AND THEN THE TWO PEOPLE MIKE PENCE AND NANCY PELOSI BEHIND HIM.
IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER OF THIS NEW TOUGHER POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES.
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF SHE GIVES HIM A MUCH MORE THAN A CURSORY ROUND OF APPLAUSE IN THE BEGINNING.
THE REST OF THE TIME I EXPECT HER TO SIT STONEFACED WHILE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ITS THEIR CHEERING.
THAT IS THE KIND OF PROSPECT THAT ALWAYS COMES UP IN STATES OF THE UNION.
REMEMBER IT IS NOT JUST NANCY PELOSI SITTING BEHIND HIM.
IT IS ALL THOSE NEWLY ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT STATE OF THE UNION AUDIENCE IN THAT CHAMBER THAN IT WAS FOR HIM A YEAR AGO.
LAURA KATTY KAY THANK YOU.
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A MARQUEE EVENT A SPEECH WHICH IS REWRITTEN MULTIPLE TIMES.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH TONIGHTS PAGES WITH HIS SHARPIE REWORKING THE MATERIAL.
IT IS ALL ABOUT STRIKING THE RIGHT TONE WHILE LEAVING AN IMPRESSION FOR THE AGES.
HERE ARE EXAMPLES FROM THE PAST.
REAGAN DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT AMERICAS BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND HER.
CLINTON THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS OVER.
BUSH THEIR TERRORIST ALLIES CONSTITUTE AN AXIS OF EVIL ARMING TO THREATEN THE PEACE OF THE WORLD.
LAURA FOR MORE ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE MAJOR ADDRESSES AND THE WORK THAT GOES INTO THEM I SPOKE EARLIER WITH STEPHEN KRUPIN A FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A HIGHLY CHOREOGRAPHED ONE.
JUST HOW HIGH ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS SPEECH TONIGHT?
STEPHEN THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD LIKE TO SET OUT AN EXPECTATION THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AS YOU AND KATTY MENTIONED A SPEECH OF UNITY WHICH IS AS CREDIBLE AS MUCH ELSE FROM THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE.
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER.
WE CANNOT LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS TONIGHT WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY AND WHAT HE WILL SAY TOMORROW.
IF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO STIGMATIZE IMMIGRANTS AND SPURN ALLIES HOW IS THAT UNITY?
IF THE WHITE HOUSE GOES TO SUCH EXTREMES TO MAKE THAT CASE THAT THIS IS A CASE ABOUT UNITY IF HE DOES THAT ONE DAY A YEAR USING SENTENCES THAT WE KNOW DONT SOUND THE WAY PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WE ALL KNOW SOUNDS IT GIVES LIE TO THE WHOLE CHARADE.
LAURA BUT AS A FORMER SPEECHWRITER HOW MUCH WORK WOULD GO INTO A SPEECH LIKE THIS?
STEPHEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK.
IT STARTS MONTHS BEFORE THE SPEECH ITSELF.
IT IS A SPEECH WHERE NOT ONLY THE WHITE HOUSE IS FOCUSED ON IT THE COMMUNICATIONS POLICY THE RESEARCH PARTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE BUT ALSO ALL THE CABINET AGENCIES.
EVERYONE WANTS THEIR LINE IN THAT PRECIOUS REAL ESTATE BECAUSE WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYS IT TO THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IT ELEVATES THEIR ISSUE.
LAURA TYPICALLY THESE SPEECHES HAS A BIG HISTORICAL SWEEP.
THE TRADITION BEGAN WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON HIMSELF.
IT IS HISTORICAL AND THE HISTORY IS ALL ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY.
IT IS NOT THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING TO THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD FROM THE OVAL OFFICE.
IT IS THE PRESIDENT COMING TO THE PEOPLES HOUSE AT THE INVITATION OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE WHICH UNDERSCORES THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES AND THE PRESIDENT WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT NEEDS CONGRESS TO PASS HIS AGENDA.
LAURA ALTHOUGH WE HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT ESPECIALLY THIS ONE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS ON TWITTER AND IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCES AS AN OCCASION DO YOU THINK THE STATE OF THE UNION RETAINS ITS POWER?
STEPHEN I THINK IT RETAINS ITS POWER IN A GENERAL SENSE BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING TO ALL GOVERNMENT ASSEMBLED AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEYOND AND AROUND THE WORLD.
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I THINK IT DOES HIM A DISSERVICE.
I THINK THE STATE OF THE UNION IS HIS MOST UNNATURAL VENUE.
IT IS AT ITS BEST AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALL FOR UNITY WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES NOT DO.
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CAREFUL RHETORIC AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CARELESS AT BEST WITH HIS RHETORIC.
PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN STARTED THIS TRADITION OF MENTIONING IN HIS SPEECH PEOPLE HE BROUGHT AS GUESTS AND IT HAS BECOME QUITE A BIT OF STAGECRAFT.
STEPHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY STAGECRAFT.
IT IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO SHOW THAT THE POLICY SPOKEN ABOUT IN THE ADDRESS ACTUALLY AFFECTS REAL PEOPLE REAL AMERICANS NOT JUST ABSTRACT POLITICAL THEORY WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED TO DO WAS TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO REPRESENTED THE STRUGGLES OR THE CHALLENGES OR THE ASPIRATIONS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE GOING THROUGH.
IN 2015 THERE WAS A FAMILY FROM MINNESOTA WHOSE STORY OF PERSEVERANCE WAS A NICE METAPHOR FOR THE WAY THE COUNTRY WAS COMING OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION.
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY PRESIDENT OBAMA USED THESE GUESTS IS IT SPOKE TO THE COUNTRYS HOPES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP OFTEN USES THEM EXPLOITATIVE WAY TO SPEAK OF TO OUR FEARS.
LAURA WE WILL SEE WHAT THE SPEECH DOES TONIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
STEPHEN GOOD TO BE HERE.
LAURA THE ACTOR LIAM NEESON SAYS HE IS NO RACIST AFTER ADMITTING HE ONCE WALKED TO THE STREETS LOOKING FOR A BLACK MAN TO KILL.
HE DESCRIBED A PRIMAL URGE FOR REVENGE AFTER A FRIEND WAS RAPED.
THE BBCS NICK BRYANT HAS MORE FROM NEW YORK.
NICK AFTER HIS EXPLOSIVE COMMENTS ABOUT RACE AND REVENGE MR. NEESON ARE YOU SORRY FOR WHAT YOU SAID?
MR. NEESON ARRIVED AT THIS NEW YORK TELEVISION STUDIO NOT TO MAKE AN APOLOGY BUT TO OFFER A EXPLANATION.
HE ADMITTED TO SETTING OUT TO KILL AN INNOCENT BLACK MAN NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO AFTER SOMEONE CLOSE TO HIM WAS ALLEGEDLY RAPED BY A BLACK MAN.
WOULD YOU HAVE HAD THE SAME REACTION IF IT WAS A WHITE MAN?
LIAM IRISH OR SCOT OR LITHUANIAN I KNOW IT WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME EFFECT.
I WAS TRYING TO SHOW HONOR AND STAND UP FOR MY DEAR FRIEND IN THIS TERRIBLE MEDIEVAL FASHION.
THAT IS WHY IT KIND OF SHOCKED ME WHEN I CAME DOWN TO EARTH AFTER HAVING THESE HORRIBLE FEELINGS.
LUCKILY NO VIOLENCE OCCURRED EVER.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN KILL A MAN?
READ IT IN A CRIME NOVEL.
NICK PROMOTING HIS NEW MOVIE THE THEME OF WHICH IS MURDEROUS REVENGE THE ACTOR HAD GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TELLING HOW HE SOUGHT RETRIBUTION AFTER HEARING ABOUT THE RAPE.
SHE SAID IT WAS A BLACK PERSON.
NICK THERE HAS BEEN OUTRAGE AT THOSE REMARKS BUT SOME HAVE COMMENDED HIS HONESTY AND VIEWERS SAW HIS PERSONAL TORMENT WRITTEN ACROSS HIS FACE.
I WENT UP AND DOWN AREAS WITH A COSH HOPING I WOULD BE APPROACHED BY SOME IM ASHAMED TO SAY THAT.
AND I DID IT FOR MAYBE A WEEK HOPING THAT SOME BLACK BLEEP WOULD COME OUT OF A PUB SO I COULD KILL HIM.
HIM USING THAT LANGUAGE IN THE INTERVIEW IN LIGHT OF HIS INFLUENCE IS NAVE.
THE 66YEAROLD HAS BEEN ONE OF HOLLYWOODS MORE BANKABLE STARS.

I THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD GUY.
LAURA IN OTHER NEWS HIGHLEVEL TALKS BETWEEN AFGHAN OFFICIALS AND THE TALIBAN ARE TAKING PLACE IN RUSSIA COMING OFF THE BACK OF THE U.S. AND TALIBAN ANNOUNCING THEY HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN PEACE TALKS LAST MONTH.
