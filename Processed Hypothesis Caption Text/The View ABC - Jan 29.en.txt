 LETS GO   APPLAUSE  FORMER STARBUCKS CHAIRMAN AND CEO HOWARD SCHULTZ WAS A HOT TOPIC HERE YESTERDAY FOR SAYING HES SERIOUSLY CONSIDER RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS AN INDEPENDENT.
AND HES HERE TO TELL US RIGHT NOW WHY HE WANTS TO DO THAT PLEASE WELCOME AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK FROM THE GROUND UP HOWARD SCHULTZ.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
 APPLAUSE  SO I AM GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOUVE BEEN A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT.
YES.
ARE YOU NOT SURE THAT YOUR POLICIES ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO RUN AS A DEMOCRAT?
WELL I THINK I WOULD HAVE TO BE DISINGENUOUS TO RUN AS A DEMOCRAT TODAY BUT I THINK THE QUESTION THAT IM ASKING MYSELF AND I THINK MANY OF US ARE ASKING OURSELVES IS WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN AND RIGHT NOW I THINK ITS CLEAR THAT THE COUNTRY WE ARE LIVING IN NEEDS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE NOT ONLY CHANGE BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT BUT CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE TOXICITY AND THE LACK OF COMPROMISE OF BOTH PARTIES AND WE CERTAINLY SAW THAT.
RIGHT.
 APPLAUSE  WE CERTAINLY SAW THAT OVER THE LAST MONTH THE PRESIDENT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CLOSING THE GOVERNMENT.
BUT 800000 PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE JUST TO EAT AND THE DEMOCRATS AS WELL AS THE REPUBLICANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL I WANT TO ASK WHAT ARE THE DEMS LEFT  I DONT KNOW SENATOR HARRIS BUT LISTENING TO HER LAST NIGHT SAY WE SHOULD ABOLISH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS A WAY TO GO FORWARD ON HEALTH CARE THAT ALONE WOULD WIPE OUT MILLIONS OF JOBS OF AMERICANS AND THAT IS THE KIND OF EXTREME POLICY THAT IS NOT A POLICY THAT I AGREE WITH AND IF YOU TAKE IMMIGRATION AND HEALTH CARE WE HAVE EXTREMES ON BOTH SIDES NOT REPRESENTING THE LARGE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO DONT HAVE A VOICE AND WHAT IM SAYING IS LETS GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A CHOICE AND WHAT BETTER EXPRESSION OF DEMOCRACY THAN WHY SHOULD WE ONLY RELY ON REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE DISPLAYED NOT ONLY THE LAST TWO YEARS BUT FOR DECADES AN INABILITY TO DO THE PEOPLES WORK.
ILL TELL YOU WHY IN A SECOND BUT  OKAY.
 LAUGHTER  I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT YOU.
WHEN I HAD A SHOW AT CNN I RAN INTO HOWARD AND THE ELEVATOR AND I SAID TO HIM HOWARD GET ME A LATTE.
HES A STARBUCKS GUY AND I WAS TEASING YOU AND I WENT BACK TO MY OFFICE AND HE SHOWS UP I HAVE A PICTURE OF IT HE SHOWS UP WITH A LATTE.
NOW THATS A GREAT GUY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THAT THE CEO OF STARBUCKS DELIVERS A LATTE TO ME.
VERY NICE.
AND I ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU GAVE INSURANCE TO YOUR PARTTIME EMPLOYEES.
THAT WAS REALLY SWEET.
THATS ABOVE AND BEYOND.
BUT BUT AND HERES THE BIG BUT MICHAEL BLOOMBERG HAS SAID TO YOU DONT RUN AND HE WAS THINKING OF RUNNING BUT THEN HE DID THE RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT HE COULDNT WIN SO HE GOT OUT OF THE RACE.
THE MAIN THING THAT SCARES ME IS THAT YOUR ENTRY INTO THE RACE WILL GUARANTEE TRUMP ANOTHER FOUR YEARS AND WE CANNOT HAVE THAT.
YOU TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS NOT WANTING TO NEGOTIATE.
THEY CANNOT NEGOTIATE WITH A TODDLER AND YOU GIVE HIM THE COOKIE ONE DAY THE NEXT DAY HE WANTS ANOTHER COOKIE SO ITS NOT EQUAL ON BOTH SIDES.
THEY HAD TO PLAY TOUGH THE DEMOCRATS WITH HIM OTHERWISE HE WILL RUN AMOK.
NOW YOUR ENTRY INTO THE RACE PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEES A REPUBLICAN IS GOING TO WIN AND I KNOW YOURE  I DONT AGREE WITH YOU.
YOU KNOW.
IN FACT NOT ONLY DO I NOT AGREE WITH YOU BUT I THINK IF PRESIDENT TRUMP RUNS AGAINST A FAR LEFT PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT  WHAT IF HE RUNS AGAINST BIDEN.
BIDEN HASNT COME INTO THE RACE YET.
LETS FINISH.
IF HE RUNS AGAINST A FAR LEFT PROGRESSIVE PERSON WHO IS SUGGESTING 60 70 TAX INCREASES ON THE RICH AND A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE CANT PAY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO GET REELECTED AND ALL IM SAYING IS LET ME GO OUT TO THE COUNTRY AND LET THE PEOPLE HEAR MY STORY I GREW UP IN THE PROJECTS OF BROOKLYN I GAVE MY COMPANY COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE EQUITY AND FREE COLLEGE TUITION FOR EVERY EMPLOYEE  YOU CANT DO THAT WITH THE COUNTRY.
YOU CANT.
LISTEN YOU WHEN YOU  BECAUSE THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM YOU KNOW WHO HAS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU OWN YOUR COMPANY YOU CAN MAKE THESE CHANGES AS YOU WANT THEM TO BE.
WHEN YOU HAVE TO REPORT TO THE SENATE AND THE CONGRESS AND ALL THE 50 MILLION PEOPLE THAT COME IN THE MIDDLE THATS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND SO YOU KNOW MY BIG PROBLEM IS I WANT PEOPLE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN AND I THINK YOU ARE YOURE SAYING TO PEOPLE I DONT THINK YOULL HEAR ME UNLESS I SPEAK TO YOU AS AN INDEPENDENT.
I THINK IF YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT THEN STAND UP FOR THAT AS A DEMOCRAT AND THEN CHANGE THE PARTY IF YOU FEEL LIKE THAT AS OPPOSED TO GOING ELSEWHERE.
THATS WHAT I WANTED TO FINISH WITH.
OKAY OKAY.
 APPLAUSE  CAN I ASK YOU ALL ONE QUESTION?
AND MAYBE EVEN THE AUDIENCE.
DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THE CURRENT SYSTEM NOT ONLY THE PRESIDENT BUT THE CURRENT POLITICAL SYSTEM AND OUR GOVERNMENT IS WORKING WELL ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
NOT SINCE OBAMA WAS ELECTED NO.
I THINK JUST ITS THE BEST THING WE HAVE.
MONEY AND CAMPAIGNS AND MONEY AND POLITICS AND YOURE A GLARING EXAMPLE AS LONG AS YOURE A BILLIONAIRE YOU CAN RUN FOR ANYTHING.
MY PROBLEM WITH POLITICS RIGHT NOW IS THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY AND NO SHADE TO YOU BUT YOU DO HAVE TO BE A BILLIONAIRE TO RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT THATS WHY MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IS AN  YOU CANT BUY THE PRESIDENCY.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DECIDE.
LET ME MAKE ONE POINT.
CAN I MAKE ONE POINT?
IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS BASICALLY EIGHT BATTLEGROUND STATES DECIDED THE ELECTION.
THATS A FACT.
YEAH.
NOW IF AN INDEPENDENT PERSON WERE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND GET ON THE BALLOT OF ALL 50 STATES WHICH IF I DECIDE TO RUN WE WILL BE ON THE BALLOT OF ALL 50 STATES FOR THE FIRST TIME  HOW?
ALMOST 40 YEARS  ILL GET THERE.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALMOST 40 YEARS EVERY STATE EVERY PERSONS VOTE WILL MATTER.
IT WONT BE EIGHT STATES ITLL BE A 50STATE RACE.
AS OPPOSED TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SO A WAY OF CIRCUMVENTING IT.
NO WE COULD GET TO 270 BECAUSE EVERY STATE WILL MATTER BUT THE ISSUE THAT  IT DOES MATTER THATS WHY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE EXIST.
I LOVE THE PRIMARY.
PRIMARY POLITICS.
NO DISRESPECT TO YOU.
YOU JUST WENT ON GWYNETH PALTROWS PODCAST.
YOURE HERE ON THE VIEW.
ALL POLITICS SHOULD START LOCAL.
WHY ARENT YOU IN NEW HAMPSHIRE OR IOWA RIGHT NOW.
WHAT A WANT TO ASK NOW  HES SELLING A BOOK.
IF YOURE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHICH I BELIEVE YOU ARE I STILL BELIEVE SORRY SUNNY TO INTERRUPT YOU.
I TRULY BELIEVE IN IT AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT LIKE IF YOU GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH IVE DONE AS ABBY THEY TAKE THEIR FIRST IN THE NATION SERIOUSLY.
THE IDEA THAT YOU NEGATE THEIR CHOICE AND IM NOT GOING TO CONCEDE THAT.
I STILL AM FINE WITH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
I THINK YOURE MISUNDERSTANDING ME.
WHAT IM SAYING IF ITS A 50STATE RACE YOU CAN GET TO 270 ELECTORAL COLLEGE APPLIES.
WITH REGARD TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA WATCH EVERY DEMOCRAT GO TO THOSE STATES AND HAVE TO BE DISINGENUOUS AND PROBABLY MAKE A FALSE PROMISE ABOUT THINGS JUST TO GET ELECTED.
I WOULD HAVE TO BE DISINGENUOUS AS A DEMOCRAT IF I RAN AS A DEMOCRAT BECAUSE IN ORDER TO RUN AS A DEMOCRAT TODAY YOU HAVE TO FALL IN LINE WITH FREE MEDICARE FOR EVERYBODY FREE FREE COLLEGE FOR EVERYBODY A FREE JOB FOR EVERYBODY.
LET ME FINISH  THATS WHAT YOU SAID  THATS JUST  NOT FREE FOR THE GOVERNMENT.
AND THAT TOTALS 40 TRILLION ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE SITTING ON A 21 TRILLION DEBT IN THE COUNTRY TODAY.
WE CANT AFFORD TO DO IT FREE SO IT HAS TO BE A DIFFERENT WAY AND THE DIFFERENT WAY IS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY HAS TO FALL IN LINE AND DO MORE FOR THEIR PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNES WE SERVE LIKE STARBUCKS DID AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND LOBBYISTS THAT HAVE BEEN PAYING THESE POLITICIANS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE TO STOP AND CAN YOU IMAGINE JUST IMAGINE FOR ONE MINUTE IF AN INDEPENDENT PERSON COULD HAVE A MANDATE FROM THE COUNTRY FROM THE PEOPLE THE FIRST ONE SINCE GEORGE WASHINGTON TO FINALLY SAY TO THE SYSTEM AND THE SPECIAL INTERESTS IT NO LONGER APPLIES THAT AN INDEPENDENT PERSON CAN BREAK THE LOGJAM OF THIS TOXICITY THAT EXISTS IN  HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
WERE GOING TO BE TALKING MORE WITH HOWARD SCHULTZ WHEN WE COME BACK.
 APPLAUSE  I CAN DO MORE TO LOWER MY A1C.
BECAUSE MY BODY CAN STILL MAKE ITS OWN INSULIN.
AND I TAKE TRULICITY ONCE A WEEK TO ACTIVATE MY BODY TO RELEASE IT LIKE ITS SUPPOSED TO.
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.
IT STARTS ACTING IN MY BODY FROM THE FIRST DOSE AND CONTINUES TO WORK WHEN I NEED IT 247.
TRULICITY IS AN INJECTION TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES WHEN USED WITH DIET AND EXERCISE.
DONT USE IT AS THE FIRST MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES OR IF YOU HAVE TYPE 1 DIABETES OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.
DONT TAKE TRULICITY IF YOU OR YOUR FAMILY HAVE MEDULLARY THYROID CANCER YOURE ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY OR HAVE MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2.
STOP TRULICITY AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF A SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTION A LUMP OR SWELLING IN YOUR NECK OR SEVERE STOMACH PAIN.
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE PANCREATITIS.
TAKING TRULICITY WITH A SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN INCREASES YOUR LOW BLOOD SUGAR RISK.
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE NAUSEA DIARRHEA VOMITING ABDOMINAL PAIN AND DECREASED APPETITE.
THESE CAN LEAD TO DEHYDRATION WHICH MAY WORSEN KIDNEY PROBLEMS.
I CHOOSE ONCEWEEKLY TRULICITY TO ACTIVATE MY WITHIN.
IF YOU NEED HELP LOWERING YOUR A1C ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ONCEWEEKLY TRULICITY.

WE ARE BACK WITH HOWARD SCHULTZ.
WERE BACK WITH YOU HOWARD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I WANT TO CLEAR ONE THING UP WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CANDIDATES RUNNING YOU WERE NOT SAYING THAT KAMALA WAS DISINGENUOUS OR THE FOLKS THAT ARE RUNNING ARE DISINGENUOUS.
I DONT AGREE WITH THE POLICIES SHE STATED BY WIPING OUT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHICH WOULD LOSE MILLIONS OF JOBS.
I DONT THINK THATS THE RIGHT APPROACH.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS SAYING.
WERE JUST WARMING YOU UP FOR A CAMPAIGN.
BY THE WAY YOUR SON IS ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS AND OUR DOGS ARE COUSINS.
YOU HAVE ONE OF MY DOGS.
I DO.
ONE OF HIS GOLDEN ON INSTAGRAM.
I WANT TO GET YOUR RESPONSE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.
NO SURPRISE HE TWEETED AT YOU ONCE YOU DID 60 MINUTES ON SUNDAY AND SAID HOWARD SCHULTZ DOESNT HAVE THE GUTS TO WATCH FOR PRESIDENT.
WATCHED HIM ON 60 MINUTES LAST NIGHT AND I AGREE WITH HIM THAT HE IS NOT THE SMARTEST PERSON.
BESIDES AMERICA ALREADY HAS THAT.
I ONLY HOPE THAT STARBUCKS IS STILL PAYING ME THEIR RENT IN TRUMP TOWER.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND AND IF IT IS YOU VERSUS  HE HASNT HEARD OF THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE.
HOW ARE YOU SUCCESSFUL AGAINST THAT?
I AM NOT RESPONDING TO THAT CHILDISH BEHAVIOR.
 APPLAUSE  GOOD.
CLEARLY THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE ROOM GOT US INTO A BIG BILLION DOLLAR WHAT DID IT COST THE SHUTDOWN.
11 BILLION.
THATS WHAT THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE ROOM GOT YOU.
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE HIM FIRED MORE THAN ME.
AND NO ONE WANTS TO SEE YOU RUN MORE THAN HIM.
YEP.
WELL I THINK WELL SEE ABOUT THAT.
I THINK THERE ARE LIFELONG DEMOCRATS AND LIFELONG REPUBLICANS WHO I BELIEVE ARE LOOKING FOR A HOME AND PERHAPS AFTER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I CAN PROVIDE THEM ONE.
ALL I KNOW IS RALPH NADER ROSS PEROT THEY DESTROYED I HAVE TO ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION.
YEAH SO THIS IS ABOUT YOUR BOOK REALLY.
I KNOW THAT YOU GREW UP IN THE PROJECTS IN BROOKLYN.
YES.
AND YOU REALLY FROM THE GROUND UP AS YOU SAY YOU CAME FROM AN ABUSIVE FAMILY.
YOUR FATHER WAS ABUSIVE TO YOU.
YOUR MOTHER WAS IN A DEPRESSION AND YET MY FRIEND ALDA ALDA SAYS SOME KIDS CAN SURVIVE THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME TEMPERAMENT OR SOME CHEMISTRY SOMETHING ABOUT THEM THEY JUST CAN DO IT.
IS THAT HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?
I THINK MY WHOLE LIFE IVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MY PARENTS PROUD.
UNFORTUNATELY BOTH MY PARENTS DID NOT SEE MY SUCCESS.
EVERYTHING I TRIED TO DO AT STARBUCKS IS ABOUT DIGNITY OF WORK MY FATHER DIDNT APPRECIATE THAT AS A LABORER AND EVERY POLICY WE PUT IN STARBUCKS WAS IN A WAY TO TRY AND MAKE THINGS RIGHT FOR MY FAMILY AND A LITTLE BIT OF FEAR OF FAILURE YOU KNOW.
JEWISH KID FROM BROOKLYN YOU CAN RELATE TO THAT.
IM ITALIAN BUT SICILIAN.
ME AND YES I CAN.
IM A FAN.
I WATCHED YOU WITH OPRAH ON SUPER SOUL SUNDAY AND IM A KID FROM THE PROJECTS AND ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE MY FAMILY PROUD AND I THINK YOUVE BEEN SUCH AN ETHICAL BUSINESSMAN GIVING YOUR EMPLOYEES HEALTH CARE AND I LOVE YOUR STORY.
BECAUSE YOU WORKED HARD FROM THE GROUND UP AS JOY MENTIONED.
THANK YOU.
I WOULD NEVER COMPARE YOU TO DONALD TRUMP AS A BUSINESS PERSON.
HOWEVER I SAID THIS ON THE SHOW.
YOU HAVE NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND WE HAVE A BUSINESS PERSON NOT LIKE YOU IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE SEE WHAT THAT HAS DONE.
WHY NOT TAKE BABY STEPS WHICH IS NOT YOUR WAY CLEARLY.
BUT RUN FOR MAYOR.
GOVERNOR.
THE SENATE CONGRESS.
GET SOME OTHER POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND THEN RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
YEAH WELL I THINK I RESPECT THE QUESTION BUT I THINK THE WORD I WOULD THROW INTO THAT MIX IS WHAT WE HAVE IS A VOID OF LEADERSHIP A VOID OF TRUST.
NO DIGNITY NO HONOR NO RESPECT IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND IN GOVERNMENT TODAY.
AND WHAT I THINK I CAN BRING IS A LEVEL OF SERVANT LEADERSHIP THAT I HAVE ACQUIRED OVER ALMOST 40 YEARS AND WHAT IVE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY AND THAT IS SHARING SUCCESS WITH PEOPLE BRINGING PEOPLE ALONG WITH ME.
WEVE BUILT A GLOBAL BUSINESS IN 77 COUNTRIES ITS NOT THE SUCCESS IVE AND ENJOYED AT STARBUCKS BUT THE LEADERSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE.
HAVING GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE I THINK IS NOT A DISQUALIFIER.
I THINK WHAT THE QUALIFIER IS CAN YOU BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER?
DID YOU LEAD PEOPLE?
AND I THINK CAN WE RESTORE A SENSE OF VALUES AND COMPASSION AND EMPATHY BACK INTO THE AMERICAN SPIRIT AND OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD.
THATS WHAT I BELIEVE I CAN.
THERES A CULTURE WAR.
DID YOU SUPPORT BRETT KAVANAUGH?
I WOULD HAVE NOT.
WHAT TYPE OF PERSON WOULD YOU PUT ON THE SUPREME COURT.
SOMEBODY WHO HAS  PARDON?
IM A PROCHOICE PERSON.
THESE ARE CULTURE LIKE YOU ALREADY LOST ME.
IM PROLIFE.
I SHOULDNT LOSE YOU.
WE SHOULD BE ABLE THIS IS THE PROBLEM.
I MEAN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISAGREE ON THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AND YET COME TOGETHER ON WHATS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY.
AND WHATS  BEING CONSERVATIVE AND MY CONSERVATIVE PROLIFE VALUES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND YOURE TRYING TO WIN OVER A LOT OF REPUBLICANS AND THERE ARE JUST SOME ISSUES WE WONT MEET ON THE MIDDLE ON.
WHY ITS BEEN A TWOPARTY SYSTEM SINCE 1865 SINCE THE WIGS.
IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH THE HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION YOU GET TRUMP EE ELECTED THATS FINE BUT NO ONE SEEMS TERRIBLY CONVINCED THIS IS A POSSIBLE  YOURE PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH.
I WONT LIVE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP BEING REELECTED BECAUSE THATS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND IM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN   APPLAUSE  HOWARD HOWARD WHATS ULTIMATELY GOING TO MAKE YOUR DECISION?
CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING REAL QUICK?
OKAY.
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FACING THE COUNTRY IS NOT THE ISSUE OF ABORTION OR THE CULTURAL ISSUES THAT DIVIDE US.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FACING THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS ANSWERING THE QUESTION IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND THAT IS DO WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN WE DO AND MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT IS NOT THE CASE AND THAT IS  UNACCEPTABLE TO ME.
SO I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO RESTORE A SENSE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY AND A REAL BELIEF IN THE PROMISE OF THE COUNTRY.
YOUD BE GREAT IN THE CABINET.
NO BUT  HOWARD YOUR PROCEEDS ARE GOING WHERE?
WHEN I GREW UP IN CANARSIE WE HAD BOOK MOBILES SO THEYRE GOING TO BOOK MOBILES IN IMPOVERISHED NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND BROOKLYN.
MAKE SURE YOU ADD AUDIO BOOKS TO THAT BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY CAN  WEVE DONE THEM.
THANK YOU  THANKS TO HOWARD SCHULTZ MEMBERS OF OUR AUDIENCE YOU KNOW YOURE EACH GOING HOME WITH A BOOK.
THANK YOU.

WE MISS THEM THE EVERYDAY AND THE ANIMALS GET OLDER.
EACH OF THE PANDAS ENJOYED THE SNOW FROM WHAT WE HEAR AND IT WAS HARD NOT TO BE HERE FOR IT.
HOW SPECIAL TO BE BACK TODAY?
I WAS THE FIRST ONE THROUGH THE DOOR SO YES.
MORE THAN 4000 EMPLOYEES WERE FURLOUGHED AND DID NOT GET PAYCHECKS FROM THE 45 DAY SHUT DOWN.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION LOST 1 MILLION A WEEK IN REVENUE.
THE CAMERAS WERE ALSO HERE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
WE WORRY SO MUCH.
THE ANIMALS ARE ENJOYING THE EXTRA ATTENTION TODAY.
WHILE THE SHUTDOWN WAS GOING ON OUT THERE AND HERE IT WAS LIFE AS USUAL.
IN FACT THE ZOO WELCOMED SOME NEW ANIMALS.
THREE NEW NORTH AMERICAN RIVER OTTER PUPS WERE BORN AS WELL AS THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW MAIL CHEETAH.
ANIMAL CARE WE WERE ALMOST AT HUNDRED PERCENT.
ALMOST EVERYONE ON GROUND HAS SOME THING TO DO WITH THE ANIMAL CARE AT THE ZOO.
WE DID OUR NORMAL JOBS AND WE DID IT WITHOUT OUR VISITORS HERE.
DURING THE SHUTDOWN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH CONTINUED ON ANIMALS LIKE APES AND ZOOKEEPERS TELL US TODAY THAT THEY COULD TELL THAT THE ANIMALS BEHAVIOR CHANGED.
THEY WERE HYPERSENSITIVE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF VISITORS.
