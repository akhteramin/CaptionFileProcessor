 so they had to remove the bone like the skull.
Francesca?
Yes.
If I followed normal protocol on this you would end up with no car.
This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio where people and cases are met with compassion.
A different kind of judge.
A courtroom like no other.
This is Caught in Providence.
Whos Mr. Holder?
Uh this is Mr. Holder Your Honor.
And and are you here with him?
Uh yes Im his counselor at the Riverwood program.
Okay and whos gonna do the speaking?
Uh I am at Mr. Holders request.
All right what do you wanna tell me about this?
Uh basically he received the ticket on Sunday morning.
Uh its not at all his first parking Saturday.
Im sorry?
Saturday morning Im sorry.
Its not at all his first ticket.
Hes had hes had 31 tickets.
Uh obviously Im his counselor for significant reasons.
At the same time its something that were working on engagingly with Mr. Holder.
And uh truthfully speaking the tickets are becoming further and further apart.
Uh he happened to have been parked across from Burnside Park in front of the old Bank of America building.
On this particular morning uh he was attending a church service.
Sometimes he goes there also to meet up with his daughter whos currently in a homeless situation.
Uh so we are hoping that uh Your Honor could find the reason hopefully to waive this and know that were working actively in terms of keeping this from happening.
Is he homeless now?
Uh currently speaking he lives with his father at an assisted living residence in East Providence.
But uh actually we have an appointment next week with the Gateway group to hopefully line up housing affordable housing in North Providence.
Tell me about the program.
I dont know what the program is about.
Um were a social services agency.
Were under the Horizon Group.
We have two locations.
One in Providence one in Warren Rhode Island uh you know in the East Bay area.
Uh Mr. Holders been a longtime client of ours and whatnot.
Ive been working as his counselor for about the last nine months.
Whats the name of the program?
Riverwood one word.
Are you familiar with that?
No but I am familiar with Horizon uh I have heard of that.
Its basically human services and social work primarily the role of the Providence program is to provide uh... affordable housing for lowincome individuals.
Based on your representation Im gonna dismiss it.
Thank you.
But I want Mr. Holder to know that... this doesnt give you a license in the future to say Its okay Ill bring my counselor down and I can get out and get way with it okay?
Im doing this based on his representation.
Do you understand that?
You explain it to him when he gets out cause hes homeless okay?
All right.
Its our intention to avoid it if at all possible.
Thank you Your Honor.
Okay.
Im just trying to see if he gives me attitude.
Despite what you may be thinking I believe this motorist actually made two wise choices in court today.
The first having his social worker speak for him.
Can you imagine what wouldve happened if he had opened his mouth?
I think hed still be enjoying the hospitality of one of our local correctional institutions.
The second is that he waited until he passed Inspector Carignan before he disrespected the Judge.
Trust me that may have been the wisest move of his life.
Anthony Michael Giacobbi.
Good morning Mr. Giacobbi.
Good morning sir.
What do your friends call you?
They call you Tony?
A.M.?
What do they call you?
I cant say what they call me.
I expected that kind of an answer.
Youre from uh... Where are you from Nevada?
Yes sir.
Yeah?
What are you doing in Rhode Island?
What am I doing?
I moved back here stupidly.
Are you calling me stupid?
I was thinking about it but I...
Listen Im gonna tell you something.
Thats not nice.
Mr. Giacobbi uh... Youre charged with going through red light on Allens Avenue and Terminal Street.
We watching these today?
We should watch it.
Yes.
All right.
Heres what were gonna do Mr. Giacobbi.
Im gonna watch it.
Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue.
There are two stop lines.
If you are past the first stop line when the light turns red Ill dismiss it.
If youre not past it its gonna cost you 85 bucks.
Were gonna take a look at it.
Look up here.
Its already red Judge.
Show the time light.
It was r red for 16.2 seconds Judge.
If I look at this... this every day and...
Im supposed to know that when the light clicks three times that its red.
Supposed to know that.
I think were all supposed to know that.
So they send me this kind of a video in a court of law.
I cant tell what color the light is.
I know it changed three times Inspector Quinn but it went from white to white to white.
No it didnt change at all Judge.
It stayed... red according to the notice.
But according to the video I agree with you Judge.
I couldnt determine... No.
The answer is I am not convinced by clear and convincing evidence.
They didnt present clear and convincing evidence to me that the light was red.
I never saw red on the screen.
I saw it all white.
I know it changed three times but I dont know when it changed three times what color it was.
Thats a very long story.
But the result is that Im gonna dismiss the case because the city has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that you went through a red light.
Now is there anything you wanna say?
Thank you.
Oh.
Hes never told me what your friends call you.
What do you friends call you?
They call you Tony?
They all you Anthony?
What do they call you?
bleep hole.
His middle name.
Thank you sir.
Well I guess we had it coming.
The Judge did ask him three times what his friends called him.
Based on his response we know he wasnt lying.
He really is an bleep hole.
Jose Horentos.
Good morning Your Honor.
You had a parking ticket on Thayer Street sir.
Yes um... That day I wasnt driving the car.
I was just getting out of the hospital cause I had brain surgery.
And my son literally parked at the corner of CVS and I got in the car.
And the lady said You know you cant park.
Theres a fire hydrant.
And I said All right I understand I had brain surgery I had my helmet on.
And then she says Yeah sure.
She didnt really believe me.
I got in the car and then you know we left.
And then I got the mail and the ticket.
She didnt even give us a ticket on the windshield or anything.
All right case is dismissed.
I appreciate it Your Honor thank you.
Good luck.
How are you feeling?
I cant hear you.
Speak into the mic.
I had brain cancer surgery and then it got infected.
So they had to remove the bone like the... the skull of my head... Yeah.

Okay were rooting for you.
Good luck.
I appreciate it.

When?
Oh I got divorced from him maybe about six or seven years ago.

Well... Just to explain what a good citizen he is.
Well the fact of the matter is that the ticket was just issued last month.
Yeah.
He just left last month.
Oh hes your exhusband...
The first one...
Hes your exhusband but you still let him use your car.
Well I try to be fair.
I mean youre telling me all these bad things about him but when he comes in you let him use the car.
True true.
That it... Thats against me for being foolish.
No its not against you.
Im just trying to figure something out.
Its because we have a child together.
Shes grown now but... Lets take a look at it.
Here he goes right through the light he dont care.
Lets look at the other one.
Red there he goes.
Yeah that was a close one.
All right lights please.

youre just too uh kind and...
Suffered for a long time.
Yeah?
I paid my dues.
Yeah.
Im gonna dismiss one of these because youre paying.
Yeah but what I wanted to do was to have him pay both of them.
Well heres...
But on his license in Puerto Rico.
Kathy when you receive these summonses on the back of the summons if you had told us who was driving the car then he would be held responsible.
You didnt do that.
And the time for that has passed.
So its too late to do that.
I would love to help you.
If I could do it I would do it.
But it has no no effect.
If you had done it originally then we would have notified the authorities there and he wouldve had a problem.
Yeah.
Okay.

Francesca?
Hello.
Your motor vehicle has been booted.
Yes.
And you came to court on... Last year sometime.
November of last year.
Yes.
Your fine was...
Yes.
I missed myokay.
I told you at that point that I would release the boot if you paid 20 a week... Yeah that was on my moms car.
For 30 weeks.
Yes.
Which is 300.
Mmhmm.
So I... said to you that you could pay the 20 a week for 15 weeks and that if you did that I would dismiss the entire balance of 660.
Yes.
You solemnly promised that you would do that.
Absolutely thank you Judge.
I will do that every week and I told you at that point that we have not changed our phone number here.
That if there was any reason why you couldnt pay that you should call.
So you made three payments and never made another payment.
I made more than three payments.
You made three payments.
So...
Some of them were for 40.
And a few like I think for 60.
You made three payments.
In January I got evicted from my apartment so after that... We havent changed our phone number.
Okay...
Im sorry.
So all Im telling you is that any representations you made to the court today I will be suspect whether or not you will keep your word because you broke your word last time after I bent over backwards to give you a big break.
So what do you wanna say?
First Im terribly sorry and... No I dont wanna hear that.
Okay well in January I wasI got evicted from my place and I was going through a lot with my two kids.
Listen the fact thatthat fact of the matter is that if the car wasnt booted you wouldnt come down here.
You know the car was booted.
you were saving 620.
All you had to do was pay the 20 a week.
You didnt do it.
it you didnt call.
We understand.
People call all the time and say Listen something happened I cant pay.
We say Okay.
But we... we at least They at least contact us.
But you just didnt contact us.
I dont know what you thought.
After speaking with the Judge I wanted 400 in order to release the boot.
Theres a little issue with that.
So the Judge has said were gonna release the boot on 200.
And well put you back on the 20 payment plan.
But I can assure you this.
If you dont adhere to the 20 payment plan a week next time youre not gonna get the car back unless its a substantial amount of money back for the city.
So the Judge once again is bending completely over.
Last time he bent over backwards.
Right now hes head over heels so... You gotta help the court a little bit.
Francesca?
Yes.
If I followed normal protocol on this you would end up with no car.
Because if I dont release the boot the car will get towed.
If the car gets towed you will then owe all this money which is 1080.
And then you will owe the tow company approximately 100 for the tow.
And then they charge storage every day.
Yes.
So effectively what I would be doing is taking your car away from you.
I know you have children.
I dont wanna do that.
But I want you to show some good faith.
Yes.
Okay so Im trying to help you.
Now all Im asking is that you help yourself.
Thank you.
Inspector Quinn explained to you Im gonna hold back on having the car towed.
leave the boot on until tomorrow.
I will be here tomorrow.
Okay.
Come in and hopefully we can get this resolved.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
All right good luck to you.
Thank you.
Gregory Gautier.
Good morning sir.
Good morning Your Honor.
You have four tickets sir.
Uh... lets see.
Two on Westminster... Exchange and Atwells Avenue.
The three most current ones um is parked around the streets that surround One Financial Plaza which is where I work.
Im guilty.
I had to run in run out.
Sometimes I got delayed so Im guilty at that Your Honor.
All right.
I was wondering if I could uh...
Waive the penalties?
Yes sir yes Your Honor.
I think we can do that.
The one on Atwells Avenue goes back a few years.
And it was uh in December.
And the um it was uh around Christmastime.
I was up there for lunch and I didnt see the... Where did we have lunch?
Iwhat did I have?
No where?
Oh Venda Ravioli Your Honor.
Do you remember what you had?
Uh... No I do not.
Judge if he said corned beef I was gonna think he was lying.
Yeah that got some pretty good dishes up there.
Uh... You know I mean they make the ravioli Theyre homemade.
I was born and raised in that area.
And many times people will say to me Whats the best Italian restaurant up there?
And the answer is there were several good ones.
I have a personal preference which I I dont feel at liberty to uh disclose.
But Italians really gauge a restaurant on... on their pasta and... And they reallyand then it goes further than that.
They gauge it on their gravy.
Now Italians call red sauce gravy right?
Everyone else when I talk about gravy they think Im talking about something you put on chicken or something over mashed potatoes.
Right Inspector Quinn?
No Your Honor.
Im familiar with the red gravy also.
Its obvious.
All right.
Im aware of the decorations up there at Christmastime.
As a matter of fact...
Ive often wondered why more tickets dont go out there on the Christmas vacation cause they do have decorations all over the place.
All right so Im gonna dismiss that ticket its 90.
Thank you Your Honor.
All right good luck.
so Im gonna dismiss that ticket its 90.
Got it?
Got it.
