 YOU WANT TO SIGN THE BIBLE THAT IS ONE DEBATE.
I SUGGEST YOU OPEN IT UP AND BEGIN READING IT OR NEXT TIME YOURE ASKED DONT PROFESS TO BE ONE THAT PRACTICES IT AND AT LEAST ONE OR TWO VERSES THAT MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF IT AS YOU SAID WAS WHAT YOUR FAVORITE IS IS TOO MUCH TO CONSUME AND PRACTICE AT THE SAME TIME.

THIS SUNDAY DIVIDED DEMOCRATS.
BERNIE VERSUS BIDEN.
PROGRESSIVES VERSUS TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATS.
HIGHLIGHTED BY THIS COMMENT FROM FRESHMAN CONGRESSWOMAN ILHAN OMAR.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT SAYS IT IS OKAY FOR PEOPLE TO PUSH FOR ALLEGIANCE TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
SOME FELLOW DEMOCRATS HERE BIGOTRY.
THE USE OF ANTISEMITIC LANGUAGE AND IMAGES CAN NEVER BE TOLERATED.
OTHERS RUSHED TO HER DEFENSE.
I HEAR HER TRYING TO LIFT UP MY GRANDMOTHER IN THE WEST BANK.
REAL FISSURES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH IMPLICATION FOR 2020.
MY GUESTS THIS MORNING SHERROD BROWN OF OHIO AND LIZ CHENEY CHAIR OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.
PLUS WAITING FOR BIDEN.
ER HAVE SHERROD BROWN NOT RUNNING.
BLOOMBERG NOT RUNNING.
BOTH LIKELY OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPECTING JOE BIDEN TO GET IN.
I HAVENT MADE THE FINAL DECISION.
DONT BE SURPRISED.
WHAT IS BIDEN WAITING FOR?
AND PARDON ME?
DID MICHAEL COHEN ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR A PARDON?
I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR A PARDON.
NOR WOULD I ACCEPT A PARDON.
THATS A STONECOLD LIE.
ILL TALK ABOUT THAT THE MANAFORT SENTENCING AND THE LATEST ON THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WITH THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ADAM SCHIFF.
JOINING US IS KASIE HUNT.
ROBERT COSTA MODERATOR OF WASHINGTON WEEK.
MARIA TERESA KUMAR.
PRESIDENT OF VIDEO VOTO LATINO.
AND THE FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA PRESIDENT MccCRORY.
WELCOME TO SUNDAY AND MEET THE PRESS.
THIS IS MEET THE PRESS WITH CHUCK TODD.
GOOD SUNDAY MORNING.
NEVER MIND THAT PRESIDENT TRUMPS CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN IS GOING TO PRISON AND THAT MR. TRUMP AND MICHAEL COHEN ARGUED THIS WEEK OVER WHICH ONE OF THEM IS LYING ABOUT A POSSIBLE PARDON.
OUR COLLEAGUE DANA MILBANK AT THE WASHINGTON POST POINTED OUT THAT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMPS STRUGGLES WITH NORTH KOREA ON THE TRADE DEFICIT THE BORDER WALL THERES ONLY ONE THING THAT CAN SAVE HIM THE DEMOCRATS.
AS HE SAID RIGHT ON CUE HERE THEY COME.
DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT MUCH OF THE LAST MONTH WRESTLING THEMSELVES TO THE GROUND.
THEY WERE EMBARRASSED OVER RALPH NORTHAM HAD ONCE DRESSED IN BLACKFACE.
AND STARTLED BY SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMMENTS BY NORTHAMS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JUSTIN FAIRFAX.
AND CHRONICALLY UNSURE TO HANDLE A COMMENT BY OMAR.
AND EMERGING GROUP OF DEMOCRATS IS CONTINUING INTO CONFLICT WITH THE LIBERALS.
THEYRE UNITED AND DIVIDED.
ABOUT THE URGENCY OF DEFEATING PRESIDENT TRUMP NEXT YEAR.
AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE DIVIDED WITH EACH SIDE SEEING THE OTHER AS THE REASON MR. TRUMP MAY WIND UP WINNING AFTER ALL.
YOU APOLOGIZED FOR YOUR LAST REMARKS.
HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT?
Reporter CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR DREW CRITICISM AFTER TWEETING THAT U.S.
POLITICIANS SUPPORT ISRAEL BECAUSE ITS ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS BABY.
SHE APOLOGIZED BUT THEN MADE THIS COMMENT LAST WEEK.
LETS TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT SAYS IT IS OKAY FOR PEOPLE TO PUSH FOR ALLEGIANCE TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
JEWS HAVE DUAL LOYALTY AND CANNOT BE PATRIOTIC MEMBERS OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY LIVE?
WORDS MATTER.
Reporter SOME PROGRESSIVES DEFENDED OMAR POINTING TO SLURS AGAINST HER.
LIKE THIS FLYER IN WEST VIRGINIA.
WE THINK THAT HATE AND RACISM IN OUR COUNTRY IS GROWING IF YOURE JEWISH LGBTQ LATINO IMMIGRANTS MUSLIM.
Reporter HOUSE DEMOCRATS UNITED AROUND A BROAD RESOLUTION CONDEMNING HATE.
AFTER AN OFFICIAL DRAFT THAT REBUKED ANTISEMITISM.
THE ISSUE IS DIVIDING 2020 DEMOCRATS.
I THINK IT WAS RIGHT IN THIS CASE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE HOUSE OF REPUBLICANS WASNT ABLE TO TOLERATE HATEFUL STATEMENTS.
Reporter BUT TOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WHILE CONDEMNING ANTISEMITISM SAYS THAT OMAR WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED.
THE DEBATE IS EXPOSING IDEOLOGICAL GENERATIONAL AND RACIAL DIVIDES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
AS THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT IS SHOWING ITS STRENGTH.
IT IS TIME TO BREAK UP THE TECH GIANTS.
Reporter SOME DEMOCRATS ARE RELUCTANT TO EMBRACE CAPITALISM.
YOU KNOW AGAIN THE LABELS IM NOT SURE ANY OF THEM FIT.
Reporter CHAMPIONING THE GREEN NEW DEAL.
DOES THE GREEN NEW DEAL GO TOO FAR?
NO.
YOU CANNOT GO TOO FAR ON THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
Reporter AND CALLING FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL.
DO YOU THINK ELIMINATING PRIVATE INSURANCE WOULD BE A SOCIALIST IDEA?
NO.
I STRONGLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE MEDICARE FOR ALL.
Reporter CAN A CENTRIST CANDIDATE BREAK THROUGH IN A PARTY THAT IS SHIFTING TO THE LEFT?
WHY SHOULD WE ELECT A CANDIDATE THAT SAYS ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT PROGRESSIVES WANT?
BECAUSE IM BEING HONEST.
Reporter THIS WEEK MICHAEL BLOOMBERG AND OHIO SENATOR SHERROD BROWN SAID NO THANKS TO A PRESIDENTIAL RUN WITH FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN POISED TO JUMP INTO THE RACE.
I HAVE NOT MADE THE FINAL DECISION.
BUT DONT BE SURPRISED.
Reporter BEFORE HIS RUN IS OFFICIAL BIDEN IS EXPLAINING A DECADESLONG RECORD INCLUDING HIS ROLE IN PASSING THE NOW CONTROVERSIAL 1994 CRIME BILL.
HIS VOTE FOR THE IRAQ WAR SKEPTICISM OF ANITA HILL AND PAST COMMENTS ON BUSSING TO DESEGREGATE SCHOOLS.
I HAVE BEEN IN THIS FIGHT FOR A LONG TIME.
I HAVENT ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT.
I KNOW WE HAVENT ALWAYS GOTTEN THINGS RIGHT.
BUT IVE ALWAYS TRIED.
AND JOINING ME NOW FROM CLEVELAND IS DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR SHERROD BROWN WHO ANNOUNCED TO THE SURPRISE OF MANY THAT HE DECIDED NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020.
WELCOME BACK TO MEET THE PRESS.
GOOD TO BE BACK.
THANKS.
COLOR US VERY SURPRISED.
IN FACT THE LAST TIME I WERE ON MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER NOTED HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE PRESENT TENSE.
IT SEEMED SO IMMINENT TO US.
YOU DID SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
YOU HAD BEGUN TO HIRE SOME PEOPLE.
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?
AS YOU KNOW CHUCK THIS STARTED OFF BECAUSE I DONT THINK DEMOCRATS WERE TALKING TO WORKINGCLASS AMERICANS OF ALL RACES ENOUGH.
IF YOU LOVE YOUR COUNTRY YOU WILL FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT WORK WE BEGAN OUR DIGNITY OF WORK TOUR.
IN FOUR STATES.
WE HIRED PEOPLE TO HELP US WITH THE TOUR AND TO BE READY.
OUR GOAL WAS TO INFORM THE NARRATIVE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SO THAT DEMOCRATS TALKED MORE TO WORKERS AND A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT.
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
I PREDICT THAT THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IS THE ONE THAT TALKS TO WORKERS THE BEST.
AND IM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRIAL MIDWEST.
IM TALKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL THERAPISTS IN NEVADA AND THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THE HOSPITAL WORKER IN BALTIMORE.
I WOULD PREDICT IF I COULD DO THIS THAT COME JANUARY 20th 2021 THAT IN THE INAUGURAL WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTELECT RAISES HER OR HIS RIGHT HAND THEY WILL LAUNCH INTO A SPEECH THEIR INAUGURAL SPEECH WILL TALK ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
ITS NOT JUST A SLOGAN ITS WHO I AM AND WHAT WE FIGHT FOR.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY ITS HOW WE GOVERN.
TO REINFORCE WHAT YOURE SAYING WE PUT TOGETHER A COLLECTION OF FOLKS THAT STOLE YOUR LINE.
TAKE A LISTEN.
WE HAVE TO REWARD AND RECOGNIZE THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
THERE IS DIGNITY IN ALL WORK AND CAREER PROFESSIONALS.
WE HAVE TO GIVE IT THE DIGNITY OF THE WORK BEING PERFORMED.
SENATOR YOUR MESSAGE YOURE DOING SOMETHING THAT MANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WISH COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM.
YOUR INITIAL MESSAGE BEGINS TO RESONATE TO THE POINT THAT YOU HAVE COMPETITORS STEALING YOUR LINES.
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
HOW DO YOU NOT RUN?
IT WAS RESONATING AND YOU STILL SAID NO.
IT WAS RESONATING AND I WOULD SAY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BUT IM NOT DONE YET.
I CAN DO THAT BETTER FROM THE SENATE.
WE SPENT THREE MONTHS TALKING ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
ILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT.
I WENT TO THE FLOOR AFTER I ANNOUNCED I WASNT GOING TO RUN AND TALKED ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS AND WORKER A SUPREME COURT THAT PUTS ITS THUMB ON THE SCALES OF JUSTICE IN FAVORING CORPORATIONS OVER WORKERS AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY OVER SICK PEOPLE AND WALL STREET OVER CONSUMERS.
I WILL CONTINUE THAT ECONOMIC POPULOUS FIGHT ALWAYS THROUGH THE EYES OF WORKERS.
ITS WHAT WE ARE AS A PARTY.
I THINK I CAN DRIVE THAT BETTER FROM THE SENATE THAN I CAN AS ONE OUT OF 15 20 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED TO JOE BIDEN?
OCTOBER.
SO YOU HAVENT TALKED TO HIM RECENTLY?
THIS WASNT HIM CALLING AROUND LETTING PEOPLE KNOW HES RUNNING?
IT WAS NONE OF THAT.
I KNOW THAT THATS BEEN REPORTED.
BUT THE PEOPLE THAT REPORTED THAT NEVER CALLED ME NEVER CALLED CONNIE NEVER CALLED SARAH BENZENE MY CHIEF OF STAFF.
NEVER CALLED MY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.
I LIKE JOE BIDEN.
I JUST HAVENT TALKED TO HIM.
PEOPLE ASK ME IN ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE STATES IS JOE BIDEN GETTING IN HAVING AN IMPACT ON YOUR DECISION?
AND MY ANSWER WAS ALWAYS ZERO.
WHEN PEOPLE WERE ASSESSING YOUR CANDIDACY YOU WERE SEEN AS ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT COULD BRIDGE THIS DIVIDE.
YOURE A GUY THAT FIGURED OUT HOW TO WIN IN THE RED STATE.
BUT ALSO HAD KEPT TO SOME PROGRESSIVE PRINCIPLES.
IN FACT HERES WHAT YOU TOLD THE NATION IN AN INTERVIEW.
YOU SAID IF I RUN I WILL BE THE ONLY DEMOCRAT ON THE STAGE WHO WILL HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR WHO WILL HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT WHICH MEANS FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND WHO WILL BE PROCHOICE 100 OVER THE YEARS.
WHAT WAS INTERESTING IT WAS YOUR WAY OF SAYING IM AN EXPERIENCED DEMOCRAT BUT ON THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE OF THE LANE IN WAYS THAT OTHER DEMOCRATS PERHAPS YOURE REFERRING TO JOE BIDEN WERE NOT.
I WAS REFERRING TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR.
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT IVE BEEN A STRONG PROGRESSIVE FOR YEARS.
I WILL CARRY THAT BACK TO THE SENATE.
I WILL BE PART OF THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF CALLING OUT THIS PRESIDENT FOR HIS PHONY POPULISM.
POPULISM IS NEVER RACIST OR ANTISEMITIC.
POPULISM DOESNT DIVIDE PEOPLE.
POPULISM DONT GIVE TAX CUTS TO THE RICHEST PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY AND TRY TO CUT MEDICARE AND HEAD START.
I WILL POINT OUT HOW THIS PRESIDENT HAS BETRAYED THE AUTO WORKERS AND HOSPITAL WORKERS.
I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT CASE FROM THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE FROM TRAVELS AROUND THE COUNTRY BY NOT YET SUPPORTING ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BUT MOVING THE DEBATE FORWARD ABOUT DIGNITY OF WORK.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS IS THERE A DANGER OF GOING TOO FAR TO THE LEFT THAT IT MIGHT SCARE SOME VOTERS SAY IN OHIO?
I HEAR THE STORIES THAT ARE THATS THE STORY OF THE DAY ABOUT DEMOCRATS MOVING TO THE LEFT.
I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT STORY UP IS HOW REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP EXTOLS BETRAYS WORKERS AND UTTERS RACIST ANTISEMITIC RHETORIC.
NOBODY IN THEIR PARTY CALLS THEM OUT.
THEY DONT HAVE DIVISIONS.
THEYVE FOLLOWED HIS RACIST ACTIONS AND BETRAYAL OF WORKERS.
THEY FOLLOW IT LIKE LEMMINGS OFF THE CLIFF.
THATS THE STORY NOT SOME DEGREES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AND AMONG DEMOCRATS.
THATS THE REAL STORY.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
WHAT IS FAIR GAME?
YOU IN THAT INTERVIEW SAID IN 1996 WHEN IT WASNT A POPULAR THING TO DO YOU VOTED AGAINST THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT FOR INSTANCE.
JOE BIDEN HAS COMMENTS ABOUT BUSSING AND DESEGREGATION OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE POPPING UP QUOTES FROM HIM IN THE 70s.
YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WAS THE MAINSTREAM DEMOCRATIC PARTY POSITION PERHAPS IN THE 70s.
SHOULD THOSE COMMENTS MATTER TO VOTERS IN IOWA TO DEMOCRATS IN IOWA IN THE 21st CENTURY?
IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT SHERROD BROWN THINKS ABOUT THE MATTERS TO VOTERS IN IOWA?
DOES IT MATTER TO YOU?
RECORDS MATTER TO ME.
THE CANDIDATE THAT IS TALKING  I GO BACK TO WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO ABOUT TALKING TO WORKERS AND THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
I WANT TO SEE DIGNITY OF WORK NOT JUST PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN A SLOGAN NOT JUST WHAT THE CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GOVERN BASED ON THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
REGARDLESS OF THE WORK YOU DO ITS ABOUT WAGES OR BENEFITS.
WORKPLACE SAFETY ABOUT CHILD CARE IN THE NEVADA IN THE CULINARY WORKERS UNION HALL IN LAS VEGAS CONNIE AND I WERE THERE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO THEIR SLOGAN IS ONE JOB SHOULD BE ENOUGH.
I WANT TO HEAR WORKERS START TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT ONE LIVING WAGE JOB SHOULD BE ENOUGH.
WITH HEALTH CARE WITH RETIREMENT WITH CHILD CARE WITH SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE.
THATS EVERYTHING TO ME IN THIS RACE.
THATS A WINNING MESSAGE AND ITS THE WAY WE SHOULD GOVERN STARTING IN 2021.
IM GOING TO CLOSE WITH THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED YOU AT THE BEGINNING.
I DIDNT HEAR AN ANSWER WHY YOU DIDNT RUN.
IS IT SIMPLY YOU DIDNT WANT TO DO IT?
I THINK WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN MOVING FORWARD AS WE HAVE.
I I WAS TALKING TO SOME PEOPLE ABOUT THIS.
YOU CAN RUN IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS.
YOU CAN RUN AS EEIOR I DIDNT WANT TO DO DO THAT OR BE THE ANGRY CANDIDATE I DIDNT WANT TO DO THAT.
OR YOU CAN RUN AS AN OPTIMIST JOYFUL CANDIDATE THE WAY I DO MY JOB IN THE SENATE.
I THINK I CAN DO THAT BETTER IN THE SENATE IN CONTINUING TO PERFORM THIS PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE.
YOURE SAYING YOU CANT RUN FOR PRESIDENT JOYFULLY.
THATS WHAT I JUST HEARD.
SORRY.
I THINK I CAN DO IT BETTER IN THE SENATE.
FAIR ENOUGH.
LEAVE IT AT THAT CHUCK.
SENATOR SHERROD BROWN.
ITS ALWAYS JOYFUL BEING ON YOUR SHOW.
THAT I APPRECIATE.
ITS SUNDAY MORNING CUP OF COFFEE AND YOU SPRUNG FORWARD.
THAT I APPRECIATE.
EVEN WHEN THE TIME CHANGES AND YOU MAKE ME GET UP AN HOUR EARLIER.
SENATOR  AND YOU BROADCAST IT LATER AND PEOPLE DONT KNOW HOW EARLY WE GOT UP.
YOU AN YOUR OHIO COLLEAGUE JOHN KASICH YOU GUYS KNOW HOW TO TALK TO YOUR OHIO VOTERS.
THANK YOU SIR.
MUCH APPRECIATED.
JOINING ME NOW IS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE CONGRESSWOMAN LIZ CHENEY.
I WANT TO START WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOUSE THIS WEEK.
IT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE.
YOU VOTED AGAINST THIS BROAD RESOLUTION.
AND WHILE YOUR CRITICISM OF THE RESOLUTION I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
BUT YOU WERE IN THE MINORITY OF YOUR PARTY.
DID YOUR FELLOW HOUSE REPUBLICANS MAKE A MISTAKE BY VOTING WITH THE DEMOCRATS ON THIS RESOLUTION?
NO.
I THINK THERE WERE TWO WAYS WE COULD HAVE GONE.
SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR CONFERENCE LOOKED AT IT AND SAID THERES NOTHING OBJECTIONABLE IN THE RESOLUTION.
MY STATEMENT MADE CLEAR THAT WAS MY VIEW AS WELL.
I DECIDED TO VOTE AGAINST IT BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS AN EFFORT PROTECT ILHAN OMAR TO COVER UP HER BIGOTRY AND ANTISEMITISM BY REFUSING TO NAME HER.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE YET TO TAKE ANY ACTION TO REMOVE HER FROM HER COMMITTEE.
AND THEY HAVE A REAL PROBLEM.
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE ABIDING BY ANTISEMITISM ENABLING ANTISEMITISM IN THEIR PARTY IS SOMETHING THEY STRUGGLE WITH.
BUT SOMETIMES ITS VERY DANGEROUS FOR THE COMPANY.
IM HOPEFUL THEY WILL BE ABLE TO STAND UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING ON THIS.
THERE WAS SOME CRITICISM SOME PEOPLE WERE PEEVED AT CHENEY MEANING YOU.
THINKING THAT AMONG MOST TOP REPUBLICANS ARE THIS.
WHEN YOURE A LEADERSHIP TEAM YOU STICK TOGETHER.
THE CRITICISM BEING SINCE YOURE A MEMBER OF LEADERSHIP YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN WITH ONE VOICE.
I THINK YOU KNOW HOW THE HILL WORKS.
THOSE ANONYMOUS SOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE SNIPING.
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO BE FOCUSED ON AND REMEMBER THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE FOR ABOUT 2 12 MONTHS IN THE HOUSE.
IN THAT TIME THEYVE BEEN THE PARTY OF ANTISEMITISM THE INFANTICIDE THE PARTY OF SOCIALISM.
THEY PASSED LEGISLATION THAT VIOLATED THE FIRST AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
ITS REALLY TIME FOR THE DEMOCRATS THE LEADERSHIP IN THAT PARTY TO STOP IT TO STAND UP AND TO ACT WORTHY FRANKLY OF THE TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE PLACED IN THEM.
ITS CRUCIAL FOR THE NATION.
I WANT TO UNPACK A COUPLE THINGS.
FIRST ON THE ISSUE OF YOU THINK CONGRESSMAN OMAR SHOULD LOSE HER COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.
YOU FOUGHT FOR STEVE KING TO BE STRIPPED OF HIS COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.
WHY SHOULD CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS DO THIS?
IF THE VOTERS SEND THESE FOLKS THE VOTERS IN WESTERN IOWA KNOW STEVE KING.
FOR BETTER OR WORSE.
AND THE VOTERS IN MINNESOTA KNEW HER COMMENTS WERE VERY MUCH WELLPUBLICIZED.
IF THEY SEND THEM THERE SHOULD CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS REALLY BE TELLING BE STRIPPING NOT ALLOWING THEM ON COMMITTEES?
THE POINT IS VOTERS SEND THEM THERE.
NOBODY IS SAYING WERE GOING TO EXPEL THEM.
WE RESPECT THE DECISIONS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE MADE.
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT SHOULDNT BE PART OF THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE.
WHITE SUPREMACY IS ONE OF THOSE.
AND ANTISEMITISM THE HISTORY OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DONT STAND UP TO THE EVIL THE HISTORY OF HOW QUICKLY WORDS TURN INTO SOMETHING MORE HORRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO ANTISEMITISM.
AS A NATION WE MUST AT ALL TIMES STAND UP TO IT.
AND THE KIND OF ANTISEMITISM THAT YOURE SEEING FROM ILHAN OMAR AND BEING SUPPORTED BY HER COLLEAGUES IS A KIND OF ANTISEMITISM THAT CAN CREEP IN AND BEING NORMALIZED IN OUR DISCOURSE AND WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION NOT TO LET THAT HAPPEN.
THERE IS AN ANTISEMITISM THAT HAS CREPT IN.
LOOK AT GEORGE SOROS.
THE REPUBLICAN ATTACKS OVER GEORGE SOROS.
AND KEVIN McCARTHY HAD TO PULL ONE TWEET THAT HE WAS TRYING TO BUY THIS OR BUY THAT.
THATS GOTTEN MAINSTREAMED TO THE POINT THAT GEORGE SOROS SAID THAT SOME GUY WAS TRYING TO PIPE BOMB HIM.
THIS WHAT ABOUTISM WHERE EVERYBODY TRIES TO POINT TO THE OTHER SIDE  CHUCK CHUCK  AND ITS GETTING  THE WHAT ABOUTISM SHOULD NOT GO ON.
AND EVERYONE INCLUDING LEADER McCARTHY HAS STOOD UP FIRMLY TO CONDEMN ANTISEMITISM.
THE THING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON IS THE DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS THEMSELVES ARE COMPLETELY FRUSTRATED WITH THE FACT THAT THE LEADERSHIP IS THEY ARE PROTECTING HER.
THIS ISNT JUST BEING SILENT.
THEY ARE PROTECTING HER BY FAILING TO PUT A RESOLUTION ON THE FLOOR THAT NAMES HER AND THAT STRIPS HER OF HER COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT.
INSTEAD THEY PUT A RESOLUTION ON THE FLOOR THAT SHE SAID THIS IS A TREMENDOUS VICTORY FOR ME.
NOW IF WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU SAY THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAS SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND HAS NO PLACE IN OUR DISCOURSE THEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO WONT CONDEMN IT ARE ENABLING IT.
THERE WAS CONCERN BY SINGLING HER OUT YOU ONLY MAKE A TARGET AND THEY POINTED TO THE WEST VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN PARTY FLYER.
CHUCK IM SORRY  BUT MY POINT IS WERE GETTING  YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY CHUCK.
WERE GETTING IN A DANGEROUS WAY IF WE DO THIS.
BUT YOU ARE WRONG.
YOU HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD WHERE WEVE SEEN THE GLOBAL RISE OF ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS YOU HAVE THE KIND OF ATTACKS WE HAD ON THE SYNAGOGUE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES RECENTLY.
THATS A MOTIVE  THAT WAS MOTIVATED BY FRINGE IDEOLOGY.
ANTISEMITIC NO MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM IS WRONG.
WHEN YOURE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WE HAVE THE HISTORY THAT WE HAVE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DONT STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS EVIL AND CALL IT WHAT IT IS.
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO THAT.
AND I THINK IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT NANCY PELOSI AND LEADER HOYER AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WILL NOT PUT HER NAME IN THE RESOLUTION ON THE FLOOR AND CONDEMN HER REMARKS AND REMOVE HER FROM THE HOUSE FOREIGN  YOU FEEL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE ENOUGH TO TAMP DOWN THE RIGHTWING FRINGE ANTISEMITISM THATS COMING UP?
I DONT BELIEVE ITS RIGHT OR LEFT.
THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE WE SHOULD ALL COME TOGETHER THE PRESIDENT THE VICE PRESIDENT THE SENATE THE HOUSE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR PARTY IS.
STAND UP AND SAY IN TODAYS WORD WHEN ANTISEMITISM IS ON THE RISE WHEN WE HAVE THE HISTORY THAT WE HAVE AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE REMAIN SILENT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US MUST AT ALL TIMES STAND AGAINST IT.
THERES A COUPLE FOREIGN POLICY HEADLINES.
THIS WAS THE PRESIDENT ON FRIDAY ABOUT NORTH KOREA.
I HAVE A FEELING THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA KIM JONGUN AND MYSELF CHAIRMAN KIM I THINK ITS A GOOD ONE.
AND I THINK IT REMAINS GOOD.
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IN A NEGATIVE WAY IF HE DID ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT PER OUR UNDERSTANDING.
THIS IS WHAT WE LEARNED THIS WEEK.
HES ACCELERATING THE ROCKET PROGRAM AGAIN.
HES ENRICHED MORE URANIUM BETWEEN THE TWO SUMMITS.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY WERE RECONSTITUTING THE PROGRAMS WHILE THE SUMMIT SECOND SUMMIT WAS TAKING PLACE.
THE PRESIDENT THERE.
YOU CANT TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD ON THIS CAN YOU?
WE HAVE WATCHED KIM JONGUN AND HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER OPERATE THE SAME WAY NOW FOR DECADES.
AND I WOULD SAY THAT REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS GOT TAKEN BY HIM.
I HOPE THIS PRESIDENT WONT.
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THEIR EFFORTS ARE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR.
HASNT HE GOTTEN MORE OUT OF THIS PRESIDENT BY GETTING RESPECT ON THE WORLD STAGE?
I THINK THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT IN VIETNAM IS A POSITIVE THING.
THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
WE DONT WANT A BAD DEAL.
IT MAKES US LESS SAFE.
BEFORE I LET YOU GO THE PRESIDENTS GOING TO ROLL OUT A BUDGET AND THERES SOMETHING IN THIS THATS GOING TO BE QUITE ALARMING TO SOME ALLIES.
THE PRESIDENT WILL ADVOCATE PERHAPS WHERE WE HAVE TROOPS OVERSEAS THINK JAPAN SOUTH KOREA GERMANY HES GOING TO ASK FOR COSTPLUS 50.
ESSENTIALLY TAX COUNTRIES OVER AND ABOVE WHERE WE HAVE BASES.
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE DIPLOMACY FOR THIS COUNTRY?
I THINK IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING.
WE BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST 70 YEARS WE ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FREEDOM PROSPERITY AND SAFETY BECAUSE OF THE BASES AND OUR COOPERATION WITH THE ALLIES.
THE NOTION THAT WERE GOING TO CHARGE THEM COST PLUS 50 IS WRONG HEADED AND IT WOULD BE DAMAGING TO THE NATION.
YOU THINK YOUR REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL SUPPORT THIS?
I WONT.
BUT THE PARTY MIGHT?
WELL I THINK ITS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DANGER THAT WILL DO TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND TO OUR FUNDAMENTAL SECURITY.
OUR SECURITY WEVE BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT IT BECAUSE OF OUR ALLIANCES AND BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH COUNTRIES.
WE SHOULD NOT LOOK AT THIS THAT WE NEED TO CHARGE THEM RENT FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING OUR FORCES THERE BECAUSE THAT DOES US A HUGE BENEFIT AS WELL.
CONGRESSWOMAN LIZ CHENEY THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WHEN WE COME BACK DEMOCRATS ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME GROWING PAINS REPUBLICANS DID WHEN THE TEA PARTY EMERGED.
ITS HARD TO KEEP COMPETING FACTIONS HAPPY.
AND THE WAITING FOR BIDEN CAMPAIGN.
THE PANEL IS NEXT.
So we reimagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuard.
It has a unique guard between the blades.
Thats designed to reduce irritation during the shave.
Because we believe all men deserve a razor just for them.
The best a man can get.
Gillette.
If you want to know why people sacrifice everything for love you have to start by asking... i Could listening to Audiblei i help you find the secreti i to a stronger relationship?i Sometimes it doesnt take anything at all for us... i Just say Alexai i give me my free Audible booki i and your firsti i pick is on us.i WELCOME BACK.
PANEL IS HERE.
PAT McCRORY THE FOREMAN GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA.
MARIA TERESA KUMAR PRESIDENT OF VOTO LATINO.
KASIE HUNT.
CAPITOL HILL NEWS CORRESPONDENT.
AND ROBERT COSTA THE MODERATOR OF WASHINGTON WEEK ON PBS.
KASIE LETS UNPACK THE HILL BEFORE WE GET TO THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
THE HILL DEBATE IS GOING TO ANIMATE THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
LET ME PLAY NANCY PELOSI ON OMAR FROM FRIDAY.
THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED WAS I DONT THINK OUR COLLEAGUE IS ANTISEMITIC.
I THINK SHE HAS A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE IN THE USE OF WORDS DOESNT UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THEM ARE FRAUGHT WITH MEANING THAT SHE DIDNT REALIZE.
BUT NONETHELESS THAT WE HAD TO ADDRESS.
I WILL SAY THIS SPEAKER PELOSI HAS GIVEN ME MY NEW FAVORITE EXCUSE SHE HAS A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WITH THE USE OF WORDS.
THAT IS EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE NEW PHRASES.
THIS IS NOT EASY.
ITS NOT EASY CHUCK.
ONE THING IF YOU SPEAK WITH MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO ARE FRUSTRATED HOW THEIR PARTY HANDLED THIS.
THERE ARE JEWISH AND NONJEWISH DEMOCRATS THAT ARE FRANKLY UPSET THAT THIS RESOLUTION WAS AS BROAD AS IT WAS.
THEYLL SAY THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.
YOU KNOW SHES USED SHE SAID ISRAEL WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WORLD IN A TWEET BEFORE SHE WAS IN OFFICE.
SHE HAD THE BENJAMINS TWEET THAT YOU SHOWED THE AUDIENCE AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW.
NOW SHE HAS THIS.
EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE HAS PLED IGNORANCE OF THESE TROPES.
BUT YOU KNOW THEYRE TROPES FOR A REASON.
SHES PICKING UP ON LANGUAGE THAT IS ANTISEMITIC QUITE FRANKLY.
I THINK NANCY PELOSI IS DOING WHAT SHE HAS VERY CAREFULLY DONE SINCE THIS NEW CAUCUS HAS COME TOGETHER WHICH IS TRY TO VERY CAREFULLY THREAD THAT NEEDLE AND TRY TO SEW THESE TWO VERY DISPIRIT GENERATIONS TOGETHER AND ITS GETTING HARDER.
BUT THERES ONLY SO MUCH SPEAKER PELOSI CAN DO.
I MET WITH HOUSE DEMOCRATS SEASONED VETERANS OVER THE LAST WEEK.
THEY SAID IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA WHERE SOMEONE LIKE REPRESENTATIVE OMAR OR OCASIOCORTEZ CAN HAVE MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS THE OLD RULES DONT APPLY.
AND SO SPEAKER PELOSI MAY TRY TO COBBLE TOGETHER LEGISLATION TO SEND A MESSAGE TO VOTERS.
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE POLITICAL CAPITAL INSIDE THIS PARTY ARE THOSE WITH A SOCIAL MEDIA FOLLOWING.
OKAY.
IF YOU GET OFF SOCIAL MEDIA THE WORLD LOOKS NORMAL.
FAIRLY DIFFERENT.
BUT IF YOU LIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA I MEAN I DONT MEAN TO CARRY THIS OVER.
THE NBA IS HAVING A PROBLEM.
ITS PLAYERS ARE MAKING ALL THIS MONEY AND THEYRE DEPRESSED ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY LIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND FEEL EVERY NEGATIVE COMMENT AND LIVE ALL OF IT.
THATS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS YOUNGER GENERATION.
AND PART OF IT TOO IS YOU DONT KNOW WHO IS TWEETING YOU.
ARE THEY BOTS OR REAL PEOPLE?
WHEN IT COMES TO BASICALLY FEELING THIS.
AND THE CHALLENGE IS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS REALLY DONE A FANTASTIC JOB COMMUNICATING TO A BROADER AUDIENCE BASED ON HIS TWEETS.
AND ITS TOETOTOE WITH A GENERATION THAT EXPECTS THEYRE GOING TO HAVE THEIR BREAKING NEWS NOT ON THE NEW YORK TIMES BUT THROUGH A TWEET.
YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO HAVE THE ACCURATE LITERACY IS THIS ACTUALLY LITERATE?
THATS A CHALLENGE.
AS A FORMER MAYOR AND GOVERNOR I THOUGHT THAT RESOLUTIONS WITHOUT ACTIONS WERE EMPTY GESTURES.
AND THIS RESOLUTION WAS AN EMPTY GESTURE WHICH TRIED TO PLEASE EVERYONE AND ENDED UP PLEASING NO ONE.
BUT THE PROBLEM FOR THE DEMOCRATS WITH THESE NEW MILLENNIALS I CALL THEM THE AOC MILLENNIALS NOT ONLY DO THEY THINK THEY HAVE THE ANSWERS THEY THINK THEY ALREADY HAVE WISDOM.
AND THE NANCY PELOSIS OF THE WORLD HAVE WISDOM.
AND THEY ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WAIT IM THE OLD PERSON.
AND YOU CANNOT MAKE THAT ARGUMENT.
ARE YOU SURE?
BRING IT ON.
HERE YOU GO.
BRING IT ON.
HONESTLY I THINK THE LEADERS CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE NEWER I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT AND I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THERE ARE GOING TO BE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME OF THE ACTIONS THEY TAKE ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE UNIVERSE OF TRYING TO GET THINGS DONE.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK THE OLD GUARD DOESNT REALLY UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF WHAT THEY BRING.
BY THE WAY GUYS I WANT TO INSERT SOMEBODY INTO HERE REALLY QUICKLY.
FIRST OF ALL THE TIMES SET IT UP REALLY WELL.
THE TIMES SAID THIS IS A DEBATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
DO AMERICANS PINE FOR A PRETRUMP EQUILIBRIUM?
OR DO THE YAWNING DISPARITIES OF THESE TIMES CALL OUT FOR A MORE TRANSFORMATIONAL ADMINISTRATION?
THAT.
ABSOLUTELY THAT.
NOW LISTEN TO AOC YESTERDAY.
THIS.
MODERATE IS NOT A STANCE.
ITS JUST AN ATTITUDE TOWARD LIFE OF LIKE  THE MEH IS LIKE WORSHIPED NOW FOR WHAT?
I REST MY CASE.
BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THERES ANOTHER ISSUE THAT BROUGHT OUT THE AOC MILLENNIALS AGAINST THE TRADITIONAL LIBERAL DEMOCRATS.
THAT WAS AMAZON.
CUOMO ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL MAYORS OF NEW YORK CITY WEVE EVER HAD GAVE TAX BREAKS TO A MAJOR MULTIBILLION DOLLAR COMPANY AND AOC FOUGHT IT.
SHE SAID WE CAN SPEND THAT 2 BILLION ELSEWHERE.
THE 2 BILLION DIDNT EXIST.
SHE DIDNT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY OF THE ECONOMY.
NOW PHILOSOPHY THATS A GOOD ARGUMENT.
THATS ALSO SHOWING THE DIVISION IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
I THINK THAT WHAT MILLENNIALS ARE FEELING IS THEY ARE FEELING FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE.
THEY KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS OFF.
THEIR EXPERIENCE THAT THEYRE GOING TO HAVE A GUARANTEED BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN THEIR PARENTS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
ITS BROKEN.
THE COMPACT IS BROKEN.
IT USED TO BE IF YOU WORKED HARD AND YOU FOLLOWED THE ETHICS OF YOUR PARENTS YOU WOULD END UP WORKING FOR A COMPANY THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR A LONG TIME.
THATS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.
IT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE.
ITS BIGGER THAN AGE.
THE POINT REPRESENTATIVE CORTEZ IS MAKING IS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS TO MOVE TO THE LEFT.
YOU LOOK AT THIS 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE WHERE IS THE ENERGY?
FUNDRAISING BERNIE SANDERS.
CROWDS SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
HES IN HIS UPPER 70s.
YET HES THE RUNNERUP FROM 16 AND HES SAYING TO PEOPLE LIKE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF NEW YORK IM YOUR TYPE OF CANDIDATE.
IM NOT A MEH CANDIDATE TO USE HER TERM.
IT TAKES TWO 75PLUSYEAROLD GUYS TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN THIS GENERATIONAL ARGUMENT HERE.
ARE THEY PLACE HOLDERS FOR NOW UNTIL THE YOUNGER GENERATION GETS MORE GRASS ROOTS SUPPORT?
I THINK THAT EVERYBODY IS WAITING IN THE WINGS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THEY ARE WAITING FOR BETO TO ANNOUNCE.
UNLIKE ALL OF THE OTHER DEMOCRATS THAT ARE TRYING TO MOVE AS FAR TO THE LEFT TO SAY YEAH IM YOUR PERSON HE HAS NOT NECESSARILY SAID THAT HE IS.
AND HES MORE PALATABLE TO THE INDEPENDENTS.
AND HES DONE THAT IN AN INTERESTING WAY.
IF YOU ASK HIM WHERE HIS POLICIES ARE THEYRE NOT ON THE LEFT.
ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.
IF THERES A CRITICISM ON BETO YOU DONT KNOW WHERE HE STANDS ON A LOT OF THINGS.
IF YOU READ HIS INTERVIEWS.
ALL OF THE LEFTWING STANCES THE GREEN PLAN WHERE THE MILLENNIALS REALIZE THEY HAVE TO HAVE ENERGY AND POWER AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE THEY WILL FIND OUT THAT ENERGY IS NOT CHEAP.
YOU NEED ENERGY TO SURVIVE.
AND THE REALITY IS GOING TO WAKE THEM UP SOME TIME.
THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS MORE TIME.
AND IM GOING TO GIVE IT MORE TIME.
WHEN WE COME BACK PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS MICHAEL COHEN IS LYING ABOUT ASKING FOR A PARDON.
COHEN SAYS ITS MR. TRUMP WHO IS LYING.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DOES ADAM SCHIFF THINK BECAUSE MICHAEL COHEN HAS LIED TO HIM TOO.
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE JOINS ME NEXT.

THIS BED.
WELCOME BACK.
THIS WAS A WEEK IN WHICH WE SAW PRESIDENT TRUMPS FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT GET SENTENCED TO PRISON.
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT.
THE MAN WHO MADE SURE DONALD TRUMP SECURED THE DOMINATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY WAS SENTENCED TO 47 MONTHS IN PRISON WITH SENTENCING IN ANOTHER CASE COMING THIS WEEK.
WE SAW MR. TRUMP AND COHEN CALL EACH OTHER A LIAR OVER WHETHER COHEN SOUGHT A PARDON FROM THE PRESIDENT.
A LOT TO CHEW ON.
WERE GOING TO TURN TO ADAM SCHIFF WHO JOINS ME FROM LOS ANGELES.
AND ON SPRINGFORWARD DAY IM GRATEFUL FOR YOU GETTING UP THAT HOUR EARLIER.
CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF WELCOME BACK TO MEET THE PRESS SIR.
THANK YOU.
LET ME START WITH A BASIC QUESTION HERE.
WHO IS LYING?
WHEN IT COMES TO MICHAEL COHEN ASKED FOR A PARDON.
AND DID MICHAEL COHEN LIE TO CONGRESS AGAIN?
WELL THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF OUR INVESTIGATION IS WHY DID MICHAEL COHEN LIE BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE ABOUT MOSCOW TRUMP TOWER?
WHY WOULD THIS BE IN HIS INTEREST?
WAS THIS SOMETHING THAT HE DID ALONE OR WERE THERE OTHERS INVOLVED IN IT?
AND THERE ARE REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS NOT A LONE DECISION ON MICHAEL COHEN.
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE.
AND THE REASON WHY THIS WHOLE MOSCOW TRUMP TOWER ISSUE IS SO CENTRAL TO OUR INVESTIGATION IS THAT IT EXPLAINS OR POTENTIALLY EXPLAINS THE PRESIDENTS BIZARRE AFFINITY FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN.
AND THAT IS HE STOOD TO MAKE MORE MONEY FROM THIS TRANSACTION THAN ANY DEAL IN HIS LIFE.
AND SOUGHT THE KREMLINS HELP TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN WHILE CONCEALING THIS FROM THE PUBLIC.
THAT MAY BE AN ANIMATED PRINCIPLE FOR THE PRESIDENT.
HE MAY BELIEVE THAT WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE HE STILL WANTS TO BUILD THIS TOWER.
AND WHILE THAT MAY NOT BE CRIMINAL IT IS NONETHELESS CORRUPT AND DISTORTS OUR POLICIES.
THAT IS CERTAINLY THE CENTRAL QUESTION FOR US.
IN TERMS OF WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH BETWEEN MICHAEL COHEN AND THE PRESIDENT WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE PROBABLY OVER 1000 FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RUSSIA ISSUES.
AND HERE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND WHAT CORROBORATION WE CAN TO FIND OUT WHERE THE TRUTH LIES.
IS IT SAFE TO SAY YOU CANT TAKE MICHAEL COHEN ON HIS WORD ON ANYTHING?
I DONT THINK IN TERMS OF MAKING THE CASE TO THE PUBLIC  AND HERE WERE NOT MAKING THE CASE TO A JURY ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THAT WEEKEND AND RELY SOLELY ON THE TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL COHEN.
WERE GOING TO NEED CORROBORATION.
LOOKING AT WHAT MICHAEL COHEN SAID IN THE OPEN HEARING AND WHAT HIS LAWYER SAID AFTERWARDS IT WAS LIKE WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WHEN HE SAID HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAYMENTS TO STORMY DANIELS.
AND RUDY GIULIANI SAID OH YES HE DID.
WHERE IS THE TRUTH THERE?
WE ASKED MICHAEL COHEN ABOUT THIS EXTENSIVELY.
THOSE TRANSCRIPTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC.
THE PUBLIC CAN EVALUATE HIS CREDIBILITY THEMSELVES.
YOU KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE DONT KNOW THIS FOR SURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE ROBERT MUELLER WILL COMPLETE HIS INVESTIGATION WITHOUT SUBPOENAING THE PRESIDENT BEFORE THE GRAND JURY OR COMING UP WITH A WAY TO HAVE HIM INTERVIEWED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY.
PRESIDENT CLINTON WENT BEFORE KEN STARRS GRAND JURY.
IF INDEED MR. MUELLER DECIDES NOT TO ISSUE THAT SUBPOENA OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE PRESIDENT IN FRONT OF THAT GRAND JURY IS THAT GOING TO HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE CONSIDERING WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHOS TESTIMONY SHOULD YOU BELIEVE?
MICHAEL COHENS OR DONALD TRUMPS?
YES I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE.
I SAID ALL ALONG THAT I DONT THINK BOB MUELLER SHOULD RELY ON WRITTEN ANSWERS.
WHEN YOU GET WRITTEN ANSWERS FROM A WITNESS ITS REALLY THE LAWYERS ANSWERS AS MUCH AS THE CLIENTS ANSWER.
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ASK FOLLOWUP QUESTIONS IN REALTIME.
BUT I THINK THE CONSTRAINT THAT BOB MUELLER IS OPERATING UNDER HE HAD AN ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS APPOINTED BECAUSE HE WOULD BE HOSTILE TO A SUBPOENA ON THE PRESIDENT.
AND NOW HE HAS A PERMANENT ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS CHOSEN FOR THE SAME HOSTILITY TO HIS INVESTIGATION WHO WOULD LIKELY OPPOSE THAT STEP.
I ALSO THINK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FEELS SOME TIME PRESSURE TO CONCLUDE HIS WORK AND KNOWING THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD DRAG OUT A FIGHT OVER THE SUBPOENA.
THAT MAY BE AN ISSUE AS WELL.
I THINK ULTIMATELY ITS A MISTAKE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO GET THE TRUTH WOULD BE TO PUT THE PRESIDENT UNDER OATH.
AS HES MADE PLAIN IN THE PAST HE FEELS ITS FINE TO LIE TO THE PUBLIC AFTER ALL HE HAS SAID ITS NOT LIKE IM TALKING BEFORE A MAGISTRATE.
MAYBE HE SHOULD TALK BEFORE A IMAGE STRAIGHT.
I WANT TO MOVE TO SOMETHING THAT WAS A BIT CONFUSING.
ERIK PRINCE THE BROTHER OF THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BUT ALSO HAS BEEN BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE HAVING TO DO WITH SOME ODD MEETINGS HE SET UP IN THE SEYCHELLES.
HE WAS ON ALJAZEERA AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT SOME TESTIMONY TO YOUR COMMITTEE AND ABOUT WHETHER HE LIED OR NOT.
TAKE A LISTEN.
WERE THERE TO TALK ABOUT IRAN POLICY.
THERE TO TALK ABOUT IRAN POLICY?
ISNT THAT IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE UNDER OATH?
I DID.
THERES NO MENTION OF THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING IN 2016.
WHY NOT?
I DONT KNOW IF THEY GOT THE TRANSCRIPT WRONG.
SO THIS WAS ABOUT ANOTHER MEETING THAT ERIK PRINCE HAD I BELIEVE WITH SOME OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN TRUMP TOWER THE SECOND SOCALLED TRUMP TOWER MEETING OF LESS SIGNIFICANCE NOT WITH RUSSIANS BUT WITH OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
BASED ON WHAT YOU HEARD THERE IS MR.
PRINCE TELLING THE TRUTH?
IS YOUR TRANSCRIPT WRONG?
HES NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ON THAT INTERVIEW.
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR TRANSCRIPT.
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE REPORTER WHO TRANSCRIBED HIS TESTIMONY.
HE DID NOT DISCLOSE THAT MEETING TO OUR COMMITTEE.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PUBLISHED TRANSCRIPT OF HIS INTERVIEW HE WAS ASKED WHAT KIND OF ROLE HE PLAYED IF ANY IN THE CAMPAIGN AND HE SAID HE HAD NO ROLE APART FROM ON HIS OWN SUBMITTING WRITTEN PAPERS HANGING A YARD SIGN OR MAKING A CONTRIBUTION.
AND HE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT ANY SUBSTANTIVE POLICY CONVERSATIONS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD.
SO HIS INTERVIEW WAS CERTAINLY LOOKS INCONSISTENT WITH HIS TESTIMONY.
BOB MUELLER HAS THAT TESTIMONY ALREADY.
AND BOB MUELLER WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF DELIBERATE FALSEHOOD.
WE HAD QUESTIONS AT THE TIME OF HIS TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS CANDOR AND HOW FORTHCOMING HE WAS AND THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN HEIGHTENED NOW.
WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING?
THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS ANOTHER CONCEALED MEETING.
ANOTHER DISCUSSION THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MEETING THAT HE HAD IN THE SEYCHELLES.
THERE HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE UAE WAS PLAYING A BACK CHANNEL ROLE TO THE RUSSIANS DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
AND THOSE WERE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE ASKING HIM ABOUT.
CLEARLY THIS MEETING AT TRUMP TOWER WITH THESE PLAYERS WAS OF DIRECT INTEREST TO OUR COMMITTEE.
SO WHY CONCEAL IT?
WHY WITHHOLD THAT INFORMATION IF THERE WAS NOTHING IMPROPER NO IMPROPER PURPOSE IN IT?
THERE ARE A LOT OF DEEPLY CONCERNING AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS SURROUNDING ERIK PRINCE AND HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
ALL RIGHT.
ADAM SCHIFF I WILL LEAVE IT THERE.
THE DEMOCRATIC LEAD ON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THE CHAIRMAN.
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON GETTING UP EARLY AND SHARING YOUR VIEWS WITH US THIS MORNING.
THANK YOU.
WHEN WE COME BACK THE STATE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ON THEIR MINDS FOR 2020.
COULD IT BE THE GAME CHANGER THAT GETS THEM OVER 270?
i We humans arei i strange creatures.i i Other species avoid paini i And struggle.i i We actually... seek it out.i i Other species doi i difficult thingsi i Because they have to.i i We do difficult things.i i Because we like to.i i We think its... fun.i i Introducing the allnewi i 2019 Ford Rangeri i Built for the strangesti i of all creatures.i WELCOME BACK.
DATA DOWNLOAD TIME.
HEADING INTO THE 2020 ELECTION DEMOCRATS ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ELECTORAL PICKUP.
ITS NOT TEXAS.
ARIZONA.
BUT GEORGIA.
THATS RIGHT.
A STATE THAT HASNT VOTED FOR A DEMOCRAT FOR PRESIDENT SINCE BILL CLINTON IN 1992.
LETS LOOK TO COBB COUNTY WHAT A SUBURB OF ATLANTA.
NEWT GINGRICH REPRESENTED AND THE RAPIDLY CHANGING POLITICS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.
IN 2012 COBB COUNTY VOTED FOR REPUBLICAN MITT ROMNEY FOR PRESIDENT FOR A WHOPPING 12 POINTS.
FOUR YEARS LATER IT SWUNG TO HILLARY CLINTON AND SHE WON THE COUNTY BY TWO POINTS.
BEFORE YOU SAY THATS JUST A DONALD TRUMP ANOMALY REALIZE THAT THIS PAST NOVEMBER STACEY ABRAMS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR WON COBB COUNTY BY NEARLY TEN POINTS.
SO A 22 POINT SWING IN JUST SIX YEARS.
WHATS GOING ON?
WE WENT DOWN TO COBB COUNTY TO FIGURE IT OUT.
ITS CHANGING IN COBB COUNTY.
IT WAS ONCE MORE REPUBLICANS.
NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF MOVEINS AND ITS GETTING A MIXTURE NOW.
GEORGIA IS BECOMING A MIXTURE.
YOU KNOW?
I SORT OF LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PART OF IT.
ITS TRUE.
COBB COUNTY HAS SEEN A TON OF PEOPLE MOVE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.
BETWEEN 2010 AND 2017 COBB COUNTYS POPULATION GREW 9.8 OUTPACING GROWTH IN GEORGIA AS A WHOLE.
IN THAT SAME TIME COBB COUNTY HAS GROWN MORE DIVERSE.
WITH INCREASES TO THE AFRICANAMERICAN AND HISPANIC POPULATIONS.
MORE RESIDENTS HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES AND MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS GONE FROM 66000 TO 72000 PER YEAR.
THE MORE TELLING DATA MAY BE WHERE THE TRANSPLANTS TO COBB COUNTY ARE COMING FROM.
OF THE TOP 20 COUNTIES THAT PEOPLE MOVE TO COBB FROM SINCE 2012 13 ARE FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE OF GEORGIA.
AND 15 OF THOSE COUNTIES VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON INCLUDING QUEENS NEW YORK L.A. COUNTY AND MIAMIDADE.
THIS IS JUST COBB COUNTY OF COURSE.
BUT YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THE CHANGES IN THE OTHER SUBURBAN COUNTIES WHERE THE VOTE HAS ALSO SWUNG TOWARDS THE DEMOCRATS IN AND AROUND ATLANTA.
SO IS GEORGIA READY TO BE A SWING STATE AGAIN?
THE YOUNGER CROWD IS DEFINITELY GOING TO GO TOWARDS THIS.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT A PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE CAN WIN STATEWIDE.
I THINK GEORGIA HAS BEEN A SWING STATE BEFORE.
I THINK ITS MOVING TOWARDS THAT WAY AGAIN.
I CANT IMAGINE NOT BEING A RED STATE.
I REALLY CANT.
WELL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.
COMING UP PAUL MANAFORT A CONTROVERSIAL SENTENCE AND THAT CLAIM THAT HES LIVED AN OTHERWISE BLAMELESS LIFE.

PROTECT CONNECT BACK NOW WITH END GAME.
DES MOINES REGISTER WITH THE DEMOCRATIC DIVIDE.
WE SHOULD HURRY UP AND GET A POLL IN HERE.
LET ME PUT UP THE DES MOINES REGISTER POLL.
MEANINGFUL AND M AT THE SAME TIME.
WE SEE WHO THE TOP TWO CANDIDATES ARE BIDEN AND SANDERS.
WARREN AT 9 AND HARRIS AT 7 RIGHT BELOW HARRIS IS BETO AT 5.
BOOKER AND KLOBUCHAR OVER 1.
WHAT IS TELLING THERE YOU CAN TELL THAT BUZZ IS EVERYTHING.
BERNIES NUMBERS WENT UP SIX POINTS FROM THE LAST TIME.
AND WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS TIME AND THE LAST TIME?
BERNIE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT TOUR.
AND SANDERS IS RUNNING AS A MOVEMENT POLITICIAN.
HES GOTTEN RID OF HIS CONSULTANTS.
HES BUILT A MOVEMENT FROM HIS 2016 CAMPAIGN.
AND SENATOR WARREN HAS A MESSAGE.
BREAK UP THE BIG COMPANIES GO AFTER TECH.
ITS A CROWDED SPACE ON THAT LEFT SIDE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
YOU KNOW CHUCK ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS IN THAT POLL IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS FOR BIDEN THE BIGGEST CHUNK OF THEM IF YOU ASK WHO THE SECOND CHOICE IS THE ANSWER IS BERNIE SANDERS WHICH IS PRETTY REMARKABLE.
I DO THINK  I THOUGHT SO TOO.
THEYRE THE MAINSTREAM OF THE PARTY THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER.
POTENTIALLY YES.
AND BERNIE SANDERS FUNDRAISING MEANS THAT HE IS GOING TO BE A FACTOR.
HE HAS A CORE OF SUPPORTERS.
IM NOT SURE ITS BIG ENOUGH TO WIN HIM BIG STATES.
BUT IF HE POLLS 20 25 CONSISTENTLY HE WILL HAVE THE MONEY TO GO THE DISTANCE.
MARK MY WORDS YOU WILL SEE HIM AT THE CONVENTION.
BERNIE SANDERS IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE HE NEVER STOPS CAMPAIGNING.
HE DOES FACEBOOK LIVES WHERE HE HAS 30000 PEOPLE WATCHING AND FOLLOWING HIM.
HE REALLY APPEALS TO YOUNG VOTERS.
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME YOUNG VOTERS ARE GOING TO OUTWEIGH POTENTIALLY THE MILLENNIALS  EXCUSE ME THE BABY BOOMERS.
THEY WILL HAVE MORE ELIGIBLE VOTERS.
THEREFORE I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE AND DO A RESOLUTION BASED ON WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE MILLENNIALS.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS THE MORE THE CANDIDATES GET OUT WELL SEE TRUMP NUMBERS GO UP BECAUSE THERES GOING TO BE A COMPARISON.
ITS ALREADY HAPPENING.
AND THE MORE CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF TALKS ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS AND CONTINUING THESE INVESTIGATIONS AFTER THE MUELLER REPORT I THINK TRUMP NUMBERS WILL GO UP.
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO PUT TRUMP IN OFFICE.
SPEAKING OF THE PRESIDENT I WANT TO PLAY WHAT HE SAID ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT BECAUSE THERES A PART OF THE EMPATHY I REALLY DONT GET WHEN IT COMES TO BECOME THE SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
TAKE A LISTEN.
I FEEL VERY BADLY FOR PAUL MANAFORT.
I THINK ITS BEEN A VERY VERY TOUGH TIME FOR HIM.
BUT IF YOU NOTICE BOTH HIS LAWYER A HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN AND A HIGHLY RESPECTED JUDGE THE JUDGE SAID THERE WAS NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
WELL THE JUDGE DID NOT SAY THAT THOUGH THE JUDGE DID SAY THIS ABOUT MANAFORT I THINK THIS SENTENCING RANGE IS EXCESSIVE.
HES BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO OTHERS.
WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS WHY THE PRESIDENT IS PRAISING AND FEELING SORRY FOR A MAN WHO DEFRAUDED AMERICAN TAXPAYERS FOR AT LEAST 6 MILLION.
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WONDERS THAT?
MANY TRUMP ADVISERS.
THEY WISH THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE QUIET ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT.
THEY WISH JUDGE ELLIS OF ALEXANDRIA WOULD BE THEIR SPOKESMAN.
COULD HAVE BEEN.
HE IS MAKING THE BEST CASE FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION.
THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF OUT AS THE COMMUNICATIONS HEAD.
THE PRESIDENT GOING ON AND ON TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLE PARDONS.
THEY WISH ALL OF THAT WOULD JUST BE NOISE.
ITS TELL LIS CASE DIMINISHING THE MUELLER PROBE.
THATS WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS.
THERES A VIDEO RIGHT NOW OF A WHALE ALMOST SWALLOWING A PERSON SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN.
AND HE SPITS HIM OUT.
TRUMP NEEDS TO SPIT MANAFORT OUT.
AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE NEEDS TO GET RID OF COHEN.
STAY AWAY FROM BOTH OF THEM.
THEYRE NOT GOOD FOR EITHER PARTY.
I THINK WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT WHAT HE WAS GETTING SENTENCED FOR WAS RUSSIAN COLLUSION.
IT WAS RIPPING OFF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT OF 30 YEARS OF LOBBYING.
ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING IS HOW UNJUST THE SENTENCE WAS FOR THIS CRIME.
IF WE LOOK AT THIS JUDGE THIS JUDGE THREW THE BOOK AT REPRESENTATIVE JEFFERSON FROM LOUISIANA.
AN AFRICANAMERICAN DEMOCRAT FROM NEW ORLEANS.
HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE EMBEZZLED 400000.
THE FREEZER CASUAL.
CASH.
IT WAS SO MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT PAUL MANAFORT IS DEALING WITH.
IS THERE A JUSTICE WHEN IT COMES TO WHITE COLLAR CRIME.
HE WAS TEETERING ON TREASON WHEN IT COMES TO THIS.
WAS THAT FAIR?
THATS WHERE WE HAVE TO UNPACK THE SENTENCE THAT HE WAS GIVEN.
THERES MORE SENTENCING COMING FOR MR. MANAFORT.
THE SPINAL TAP DRUMMER COMMISSION AT THE WHITE HOUSE  I MEAN THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR POSITION AT THE WHITE HOUSE  THERES SOME INSIGHT.
I LOVE IT.
HE BROUGHT UP BILL SHINE.
YOU WANT TO BE THE COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR?
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN KASIE?
TO BOBS EARLIER POINT WERE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THE SAME.
YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY WOULDNT WANT TO BE THE PERSON THAT NEEDS TO TELL THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
GOOD LUCK.
HES BEEN DOING IT HIS ENTIRE LIFE.
HOW MUCH DID THE NEW YORKER PIECE HAVE TO DO WITH SHINES RELEASE?
THE PRESIDENT WAS FRUSTRATED WITH BILL SHINE NOT BRINGING THE FOX NEWS EXPERTISE.
MOST REVEALING OF THE MOST RECENT WEEKS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT CPAC TWO HOURS.
VOLUME AT 11 FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING THE SPEECH.
THATS ALL I HAVE FOR TODAY.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
SPRINGING FORWARD WITH US.
WELL BE BACK NEXT WEEK BECAUSE IF ITS SUNDAY NO MATTER THE HOUR ITS MEET THE PRESS.
Ive always been amazed by whats next.
And still going for my best even though I live with a higher risk of stroke due to Afib not caused by a heart valve problem.
So if theres a better treatment than warfarin...
I want that too.
ELIQUIS.
ELIQUIS is proven to reduce stroke risk better than warfarin.
Plus has significantly less major bleeding than warfarin.
ELIQUIS is FDAapproved and has both.
Whats next?
Reeling in a nice one.
i Dont stop taking ELIQUISi iunless your doctor tells you toi ias stopping increases your riski i of having a stroke.i i ELIQUIS can cause serious andi i in rare cases fatal bleeding.i i Dont take ELIQUIS If you havei i an artificial heart valvei i or abnormal bleeding.i i While taking ELIQUISi i you may bruise more easilyi i and it may take longer thani iusual for any bleeding to stop.i i Seek immediate medical carei i for sudden sign of bleedingi i like unusual bruising.i i ELIQUIS may increase youri i bleeding riski i if you take certain medicines.i i Tell your doctori i about all planned medicali i or dental procedures.i ELIQUIS the number one cardiologistprescribed blood thinner.
Ask your doctor if ELIQUIS is whats next for you.
Guys do whatever it takes to deal with shave irritation.
So we reimagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuard.
It has a unique guard between the blades.
Thats designed to reduce irritation during the shave.
Because we believe all men deserve a razor just for them.
The best a man can get.
