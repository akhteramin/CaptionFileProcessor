 REMEMBERED THE LAST WORDS HES KNOWN TO HAVE SAID WERE RECITED.
QUOTE AT THE END THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS HOW MUCH WE LOVED.
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.
THAT WRAPS THINGS UP FOR US THIS HOUR.
IMWASHINGTON.
ALI PICKS THINGS UP.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LAUNCHED A NEW ATTACK ON CHINA AND EUROPE ACCUSING THEM OF PLAYING A BIG CURRENCY MANIPULATION GAME.
HE TWEETED UNITED STATES SHOULD MATCH THE EFFORT OR CONTINUE TO BE THE DUMMIES WHO SIT BACK AND WATCH AS OTHER COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO PLAY THEIR GAMES.
SUCH A MOVE BY THE WAY WOULD DIRECTLY CONTRADICT U.S. POLICY NOT TO MANIPULATE THE DOLLARS VALUE TO GAIN TRADE ADVANTAGES.
AND THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT SAID EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT NO COUNTRY MEETS ITS CRITERIA OF BEING LABELLED A CURRENCY MANIPULATOR ALTHOUGH IT PUT CHINA AND EIGHT OTHER COUNTRIES ON A WATCH LIST.
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PUSHING THIS IRFOR YEARS.
AS A CANDIDATE HE REPEATEDLY ACCUSED CHINA OF MANIPULATING ITS CURRENCY AND VOWED TO FIGHT BACK.
WE CANT LET THESE OTHER COUNTRIES MANIPULATE THEIR CURRENCIES.
THEYRE DEVALUING THEIR CURRENCIES.
THEYRE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COMPANIES OUR COMPANIES CANNOT COMPETE.
WERE GOING TO HAVE OUR JOBS AND MAKE OUR OWN PRODUCT.
AND WERE GOING TO SELL THAT PRODUCT ALSO.
AND WERE NOT GOING TO LET CHINA AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY.
NOW THE MARKETS DEFINITELY SEEMED TO SHRUG OFF THE PRESIDENTS TWEET.
IN THE VERY SHORT PREHOLIDAY TRADING DAY THE MARKET IS CLOSED.
THE DOW GAVE 139 POINTS TO CLOSE AT A RECORD HIGH 26966.
AND THE SP AS WELL.
NASDAQ ALSO CLOSING AT AN ALLTIME RECORD.
LETS TALK ABOUT THIS.
WHAT IS CURRENCY MANIPULATION?
WELL ITS A POLICY OF WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OR A LOCAL BANK SELLS ITS OWN CURRENCY REDUCING THE DEMAND FOR ITS OWN CURRENCY.
WHEN YOU REDUCE DEMAND FOR SOMETHING YOU DRIVE THE VALUE OF IT DOWN.
WHEN THE CURRENCY DRIVES DOWN THE VALUE OF ITS CURRENCY IT MAKES ITS EXPORTS CHEAPER AND IMPORTING MORE EXPENSIVE.
WHEN A COUNTRY BOOSTS ITS EXPORTS THAT HELPS LOWER THE TRADE DEFICIT SOMETHING PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO DO.
LOWERING THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WOULD LIKELY BOOST EXPORTS WHILE THATS GOOD NEWS MANIPULATING THE DOLLAR COULD ALSO CAUSE FOREIGN INVESTORS TO MOVE THEIR INVESTMENTS ELSEWHERE BECAUSE THE LOWER DOLLAR MEANS LOWER RETURNS ON YOUR INVESTMENTS.
IN ADDITION IT WOULD AFFECT THE PRICE OF OIL GOLD AND OTHER COMMODITIES.
BOTTOM LINE ITS A COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT BUSINESS TO MANIPULATE THE VALUE OF YOUR CURRENCY ON GLOBAL MARKETS.
I WANT TO HAVE A CLOSER LOOK WITH A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTER OF BUDGET AND FELLOWS PRIORITIES.
JAROD GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I GUESS I WANT TO START BY SAYING YOURE A PROGRESSIVE ECONOMIST.
BUT THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE.
THERE ARE SCHOOLS EVER THOUGHT OF LOWERING CURRENCY AND RAISING BUT IT DOESNT APPEAR TO BE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN ISSUE?
NO IN FACT PRESIDENTS OF ALL STRIPES HAVE SAID WE SUPPORT A STRONG DOLLAR AND IN THAT SENSE TRUMP IS UNUSUAL.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS UNUSUAL AT LEAST HALF OF THAT TRUMP TWEET WAS ACCURATE.
MANY OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS CHINA THE PAST HAVE MANAGED OR MISALIGNED THEIR CURRENCY VALUES PRECISELY THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED.
TO MAKE OUR EXPORTS CHEAPER AND OURS TO THEM MORE EXPENSIVE.
AND THE RESULT IS A SIGNIFICANT TRADE IMBALANCE WHICH WEVE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY DECADES.
BUT THE IRONIC THING IS THAT TRUMPS ACTIONS HAVE ACTUALLY MADE THIS PROBLEM WORSE.
THEYVE STRENGTHENED THE DOLLAR.
SO FIRST OF ALL IS IT INACHIEVABLE WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS WE SHOULD PLAY THAT GAME?
CAN YOU PLAY THAT GAME GIVEN THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD COLLECTS U.S.
DOLLARS NOT JUST TO BUY GOODS BUT TO BUY OIL AND GOLD.
AND CAN THE U.S.
UNLIKE ZIMBABWE OR THAILAND OR A PLACE LIKE THAT CAN IT ACTUALLY MANIPULATE ITS CURRENCY DELIBERATELY?
THE ANSWER IS YES IT COULD.
BUT YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTAL POINT.
THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE PRIMARY RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE WORLD.
THATS THE CURRENCY AS YOU JUST SAID OTHER COUNTRIES OFTEN TRADE IN.
ALSO WHATS THE SAFEST ASSET IF YOU WANT TO PARK YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE SAFE?
ITS HERE IN THE U.S.
SO THAT MEANS FOLKS NEED DOLLARS TO BUY OUR TREASURY SECURITIES.
BY THE WAY WHEN I SAID TRUMP IS PARTLY AT THE CORE OF THIS PROBLEM BY RUNNING THESE VERY VERY LARGE BUDGET DEFICITS ESPECIALLY IN A PERIOD OF LOW UNEMPLOYMENT NOT ONLY IS OUR COUNTRY GOING FASTER AND THAT TENDS TO MAKE OUR DOLLAR STRONGER THAN OTHER CURRENCIES BUT ITS PULLING IN MORE CAPITAL FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE SEEKING THESE SAFE ASSETS.
BUT BOTTOM LINE YES THERE ARE THINGS WE COULD DO.
AND FRANKLY THINGS WE SHOULD DO.
THE LEAST WE SHOULD DO IS IDENTIFY THOSE WHO MANIPULATE THEIR CURRENCIES AND AMAZINGLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ESSENTIALLY REFUSED TO DO SO.
ALL RIGHT.
LETS TALK ABOUT BEING THE PRIMARY RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE WORLD.
ONE OF THE REASONS THE U.S. IS THAT THING IS BECAUSE ITS RELATIVELY STABLE.
IF YOU PUT YOUR MONEY INTO U.S.
DOLLARS TO BUY TREASURIES OR TO BUY PROPERTY IN MIAMI OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO WITH YOUR MONEY THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY DOESNT TEND TO FLUCTUATE ALL THAT MUCH.
IF WE SEND OUT A SIGNAL THAT WERE LOOKING TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WHATS THE EFFECT OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE COMPANIES SOVEREIGN FRONTS TO INVEST IN DOLLARS BECAUSE ITS A SAFE CURRENCY?
ITS REALLY HARD TO SAY BECAUSE WE JUST DONT DO THAT.
I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THE DOLLAR FLUCTUATES PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY.
IN FACT ONE OF THE WAYS YOU COULD TELL WHEN CHINA AND OTHERS WERE PEGGING THEIR CURRENCY IS BECAUSE THEY DIDNT FLUCTUATE.
THEY KEPT IT AT A STRAIGHT LINE.
THE U.S. DOLLAR GOES UP AND DOWN.
ITS UP 7 10 OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
AND WE DONT SEE DRAMATIC CHANGES IN ANY OF THE KIND OF TRADES YOU JUST MENTIONED.
SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH OUR WHILE TO AT LEAST EXAMINE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN PUSH BACK AGAINST THOSE WHO MISALIGN THEIR CURRENCIES BECAUSE IT DOES LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT TRADE IMBALANCES.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MOST OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE THE PROBLEM WORSE.
JARED GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS.
THANKS FOR TACKLING A COMPLICATED TOPIC.
JARRED BERNSTEIN.
WHILE THE PRESIDENT CREATES THIS LATEST ISSUE OVER CURRENCY MANIPULATION THE ADMINISTRATION IS GETTING LEGAL PUSHBACK FOR HOW ITS HANDLING THE IMMENSE BACKLOG OF IMMIGRATION CASES IN THE U.S. COURT SYSTEM.
A FEDERAL JUDGE REVERSED A DIRECTIVE FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR THAT ORDERED IMMIGRATION JUDGES TO HOLD ASYLUMSEEKING MIGRANTS WITHOUT BAIL.
IT KEPT MIGRANTS DETAINED INSTEAD OF REDUCING THEM WHILE THEIR CASES MOVED THROUGH THE COURTS.
CREDIT SICKS SAY THE DIRECTIVE WOULD HAVE KEPT UP TO 40000 MIGRANTS IN CUSTODY FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT HAVING TO JUSTIFY DETENTIONS.
AS OF APRIL THERES A BACKLOG OF NEARLY 900000 CASES PENDING CASES OVERSEEN BY 424 JUDGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
THE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE RULED THAT THE POLICY WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND MAINTAINED THOSE ENTERING THE UNITED STATES ARE ENTITLED DUE PROCESS UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.
THE COURT CONCLUDED AMONG THOSE PROTECTIONS IS A LONGSTANDING PROHIBITION AGAINST INDEFINITE CIVIL DETENTION WITH NO OPPORTUNITY TO TEST ITS NECESSITY.
THE NINTH CIRCUIT HAS EXPRESSED GRAVE DOUBTS THAT ANY STATUTE THAT ALLOWS FOR ARBITRARY PROLONGED DETENTION WITHOUT ANY PROCESS IS CONSTITUTIONAL.
NOW LETS REMIND OURSELVES WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SOLVING HERE.
BEFORE THIS CHANGE WAS MADE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAYS 7.89 OF ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM THE NORTHERN TRIANGLE COUNTRIES GUATEMALA HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR WERE GRANTED ASYLUM IN FISCAL YEAR 2017.
SO WHEN PEOPLE TELL YOU THERES A CRAZY SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE ARE APPLYING FOR ASYLUM GETTING IT 7.89 GET IT.
FIGURES SHOW 89 OF ASYLUM SEEKERS DO IN FACT SHOW UP FOR COURT DATES.
WERE TALKING ABOUT 11 WHOSE CASESES ARE DECIDED IN ABSENTIA.
TYPICALLY DECIDED AGAINST THOSE PEOPLE.
SO ITS JUST IMPORTANT TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OR SOCALLED SERIOUS PROBLEM.
I WANT TO GET INTO THE NECESSITY OF ALL OF THIS WITH NBC LEGAL ANALYST DANNY CEVALLOS.
THIS IS A REMINDER THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF UNITED STATES MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN CITIZENS OR NONCITIZENS IN ITS PRESCRIPTION.
SO IN THIS CASE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAUSE THAT CALLS FOR A SPEEDY TRIAL IS FOR EVERYBODY?
YES.
BUT THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY ARGUED AGAINST WHAT YOU JUST SAID BY ARGUING TO THE COURT THAT THESE MIGRANTS ARE EXCLUDABLE PERSONS.
THEY DONT REALLY FIT WITHIN THE GROUP OF PEOPLE PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION.
AND THE COURT SAID THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN THIS SITUATION.
AS A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHEN YOUR CLIENT IS HELD IN CUSTODY THERES SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CLIENT THAT IS HELD IN CUSTODY AND NOT IN CUSTODY THAT YOU CAN CONTACT YOU CAN CALL MEET WITH THEM.
ANY LAWYER ALWAYS PROVIDES BETTER LEGAL SERVICES AND THAT CLIENT IS BETTER SERVED WHEN THEY CAN FIGHT THEIR CASE ON THE OUTSIDE AND NOT THE INSIDE.
WHATS DIFFERENT HERE THESE ARE NONCRIMINALS.
THESE ARE NONCRIMINALS BEING DETAINED.
AND I SHOULD ADD A DECISION THAT HAS HAD SUCH A RIPPLE EFFECT THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT.
STATISTICALLY THIS IS CAUSING IMMENSE BACKLOG IN THE COURTS.
THATS ANOTHER THING I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR THOSE WITH CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHICH IS EVERYONE WHICH IS A BACKLOG IN THE CRIMINAL COURT.
THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM IN ANY COUNTRY BUT ITS ACTUALLY SOMETHING IN THE UNITED STATES THAT IS IN OUR CONSTITUTION.
ITS OBVIOUSLY OPEN TO INTERPRETATION WHAT A SPEEDY TRIAL IS.
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE 400 SOME ODD IMMIGRATION JUDGES DEALING WITH 900000 CASES AT OUR CURRENT PACE THATS DECADES.
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES COVERING THIS ISSUE AT THE BORDER.
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE A SUMMARY DECISION TO START PROSECUTING MORE AND MORE OF THESE ENTRY CASES.
AND THE BACKLOG.
THE COURTS ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO BACKLOGS.
EVEN THE FEDERAL COURTS WHICH MAY HAVE MORE RESOURCES CAN BE CRIPPLED.
SO TOO THIS IMMIGRATION PROCESS BY A DECISION THAT CAUSES A BACKLOG BY HOLDING PEOPLE LONGER THAN NECESSARY.
KEEP IN MIND THE GOVERNMENT ARGUED THAT LOOK THERE ARE CASES THAT SAYS YOU CAN HOLD PEOPLE UP TO SIX MONTHS.
WHATS WITH THE SEVEN DAYS SUCH A FAST TIME LINE.
THE COURT SAID THATS NOT THE ISSUE.
THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE HELD WITHOUT ANY BAIL HEARING WHATSOEVER.
THANK YOU DANNY DANNY CEVALLOS IS OUR LEGAL ANALYST.
TO UNDERSCORE THIS I TURN TO THIS QUOTE A TICKING TIME BOMB.
THATS HOW SENIOR MANAGERS AT SEVERAL BORDER PATROL FACILITIES AT RIO GRANDE DESCRIBED IT.
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DETAILED THE DIRE SITUATION.
GIVING A LOOK INSIDE.
DESPITE THE OUTRIGHT DENIALS BY THE ADMINISTRATION THE SITUATION IS DIRE.
IN JUNE THE OFFICE JUST BE REMINDED THIS IS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.
THIS ISNT REPORTERS.
THE OFFICE VISITED TWO PORTS OF ENTRY OBSERVING VOTE SERIOUS OVERCROWDING AND PROLONGED ATTENTION.
THEY FOUND THE BORDER PATROL WAS HOLDING 8000 DETAINEES.
WITH 3400 HELD LONGER THAN 72 HOURS GENERALLY PERMITTED UNDER THE CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTIONS STANDARDS.
1500 OF THOSE DETAINED WERE HELD FOR MORE THAN TEN DAYS.
926 CHILDREN WERE HELD.
ON TOP OF THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THESE CHILDREN WERE DETAINED WERE BELOW BORDER PATROL STANDARDS.
CHILDREN HAD NO ACCESS TO SHOWERS DESPITE REQUIREMENTS THAT REASONABLE EFFORTS BE MADE TO PROVIDE SHOWERS TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN IN DETENTION FOR 48 HOURS.
CHILDREN HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.
AND TWO FACILITIES HAD NOT PROVIDED THEM ANY ACCESS TO HOT MEALS.
FOR ADULTS THE CDP REQUIRES THAT REASONABLE EFFORTS BE MADE TO BE PROVIDED TO SHOWER.
SAYING MOST SINGLE ADULTS HAD NOT HAD A SHOWER IN CBP CUSTODY FOR AS LONG AS A MONTH.
BORDER PATROL WAS GIVING WEAPON WET WIPES.
JOINING US NOW SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN UNTIL DETENTION FACILITIES AND FAMILIAR WITH THEIR CONDITIONS MSNBCS JACOB SOBOROFF.
JACOB YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING THIS FOR A LONG TIME AS YOUR COLLEAGUES HERE ON MSNBC.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE GONE IN.
THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE IS THESE ARE INACCURATE REPORTS THIS IS NOT THE CASE BUT NOW WEVE GOT THE INSPECTOR GENERALS REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SAYING?
NOT ONLY DOES THIS INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ALI DIRECTLY CONTRADICT WHAT KEVIN McALEENAN HAS BEEN SAYING BUT JULIA AINSLEY NOT ONLY IN THE RIO GRANDE BUT EL PASO SECTOR.
WERE SEEING IT ACROSS THE BORDER.
AND THAT FLAZ TICKING TIME BOMB IS ONE THATS GETTING EVERYBODYS ATTENTION.
YOU ARE HOUSING MIGRANTS WHO ARE COMING HERE FOR HUMANITARIAN RELIEF IN JAIL CELLS.
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT KEVIN McALEENAN FRANKLY HAS SAID.
IT SHOULD NOT COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANYONE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR IN THE POLITICAL BRANCH THAT THINGS ARE AS BAD AS THEY ARE.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE THINGS WORSE BY EXACERBATING CRISIS CEASE ON THE BORDER.
BY MAKING PEOPLE WAIT IN MEXICO BY TELLING PEOPLE THERE ARE LIMITED PORTS OF ENTRY ONLY ALLOWING A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE THROUGH EVERY DAY.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE CROSSING ILLEGALLY THEYRE BEING DETAINED AS IF THEY WERE CRIMINALS AND ALL THEY WANT IS RELIEF.
LIKE THE RELIEF YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DANNY CEVALLOS ASYLUM PROTECTION WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL RIGHT.
DANNY KEVIN McALEENAN HAS CALLED FOR.
BUT THERE WAS A SECRET FACEBOOK PAGE THAT SOMEBODY LEAKED INDICATING THE CULTURE AT LEAST SOME OF THESE EMPLOYEES OF CBP HAVE BECAUSE THERES ABOUT TEN000 PEOPLE ON THIS PAGE.
THE CULTURE THAT YOURE SEEING EMERGE THERE ALI IS ONE THAT MATCHES DIRECTLY THE CONDITIONS THAT YOURE SEEING INSIDE OF DETENTION FACILITIES.
AND WHILE WE CANT ASCRIBE THE DEHUMANIZATION AND THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED IN THOSE FACEBOOK POSTS TO ALL OF THE AGENTS IN BOATER PATROL.
IN FACT IVE METTLE EXCELLENT MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK FOR THE BORDER PATROL.
YOU HAVE TO BE ALARMED BY WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE.
THE COMBINATION OF PEOPLE BEING HELD IN CONDITIONS LIKE THE ONES THAT WERE LOOKING AT ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW.
AND THE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS YOU ARE HEARING FROM THE  REMEMBER THESE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ALLEGEDLY THAT ARE TALKING THIS WAY ABOUT PEOPLE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE OF AND SUPERVISING IS INCREDIBLY CONCERNING.
SO THE ACTING SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY KEVIN McALEENAN AND THE LAUNCH INVESTIGATION FROM THE OFFICE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THEYLL LOOK INTO WHETHER OR NOT THESE AGENTS ARE MEETING THE STANDARDS THE DEPARTMENT.
I THINK ITS PRETTY CLEAR TO SEE JUST BY READING SOME OF WHAT WAS ON FACEBOOK THAT THEY CERTAINLY WERE NOT.
JACOB THANK YOU.
JOINING ME A CONGRESSWOMAN WHO LED THEY ARE FELLOW LAWMAKERS DURING THE TOUR OF THE LARGEST FACILITY IN FLORIDA HOMESTEAD.
FREDERICA WILSON.
CONGRESSWOMAN WHAT DID YOU SEE WHILE YOU WERE THERE?
THANK YOU ALI.
WELL IVE BEEN ON THIS MISSION FOR TWO YEARS NOW TRYING TO LOCATE THE GIRLS AND DO OVERSIGHT OVER ADOLESCENT GIRLS.
I WENT TO BROWNSVILLE TEXAS.
VISITED TWO FACILITIES THERE.
IVE BEEN TO HOMESTEAD.
AND THEN I DECIDED TO INVITE MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES TO GO WITH ME TO HOMESTEAD JUST TO KEEP UP WITH ADOLESCENT GIRLS WHO SHOULD NOT BE IN JAIL.
AND THATS SPECIFICALLY WHAT THEYRE IN.
AND THEYRE JUST CROWDING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CROWDED AND NOISY IN THIS JAIL.
THATS WHAT I CALL IT.
ITS A JAIL.
AND THEY ARE IN CLASSES BUT I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
AND THE BATHROOMS THE ONLY TOILETS THEY CAN USE ARE OUTSIDE.
AND THEIR DORMITORY IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM WITH JUST BUNK BEDS TWO FEET APART.
WOW.
WHERE THESE CHILDREN HAVE TO SLEEP.
AND WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT NIGHT THEY HAVE TO GET UP AND GO OUTSIDE IN THE DARK.
IN THE NIGHT.
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
TO PORTABLE TOILETS.
CONGRESSWOMAN THIS IS A PRIVATELY RUN FACILITY IN WHICH WE AS TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING THEM A DAY RATE TO ACCOMMODATE THESE STUDENTS.
A RATE IN SOME OF THESE CASES IS SURPRISINGLY HIGH.
IN EXCESS OF 700 A NIGHT.
AND THEYRE SLEEPING IN THIS WAY THEYRE LIVING IN THIS WAY?
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
SOME OF THEM ARE SICK.
INFLUENZA IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THEYRE SUFFERING CRYING THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR PARENTS.
AND THE SAD PART ABOUT IT THE GIRLS THAT I FINALLY GOT TO SEE AFTER DEMANDING AND STAYING OVER TWO HOURS EVERY EVERYONE HAD LEFT TO SEE THE GIRLS I SAW THIS ROOM FULL OF 17 YEAR OLDS.
AND THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY WAITING FOR THE DAY THAT THEY TURN 18.
AND WHEN THEY TURN 18 THEYRE GOING TO SHACKLE THEIR WRISTS ANKLES AND TAKE THEM TO JAIL.
THAT IS THE SADDEST THING.
WHAT DOES SUCCESS IN THIS SITUATION LOOK LIKE TO YOU?
ITS DIRE.
BECAUSE WHAT THEYRE TRYING TO DO AND WHAT THEYRE GOING TO DO IS EXPAND THIS FACILITY.
INSTEAD OF RELEASING THESE CHILDREN OUT OF THIS FACILITY GIVING THEM A HOME TO WAIT ON THEIR CASES.
AND SOME OF THEM HAVE PHONE NUMBERS TATTOOED TO THEIR WRISTS.
SOME OF THEM HAVE LITTLE NOTES THAT THEY CAN SHOW ME OF AUNTIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING FOR THEM.
THEYRE EXPANDING THIS FACILITY.
AND TRYING TO TAKE 1000 MORE.
THEY ALREADY HAVE IN EXCESS OF 2000 CHILDREN.
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
AND THERES NO WAY TO KNOW WHETHER THESE CHILDREN ARE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE HYGIENE.
THESE LITTLE GIRLS ARE GOING FROM GIRLHOOD TO WOMENHOOD.
I JUST DID NOT LIKE WHAT I SEE.
IM GOING TO GO BACK AND KEEP WATCHING THESE GIRLS.
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING IF THEY CAN DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME ITS BEGIN TO RELEASE THESE GIRLS BY THE HUNDREDS INTO THE COMMUNITY.

THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE HITTING THE ROAD THIS WEEK TAKE NOTHING BREAK FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY HOLIDAY.
TODAY THEYRE SPREAD ACROSS KEY PRIMARY STATES OF IOWA NEVADA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.
NOW WE HAVE NEW POLLING ALL SHOWING FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IN THE LEAD.
SEC PLACE ALTERNATING BETWEEN SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AND SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
LOOKING AT THE QUINNIPIAC POLL HARRIS HAS CLOSED THE GAP UP 13 POINTS IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN DOWN EIGHT POINTS.
HARRIS STANDS AT 20 BIDEN AT SENATORS ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS FOLLOW.
SENATOR HARRIS AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ARE AMONG THE CANDIDATES CAMPAIGNING IN IOWA.
WHEN A USA TODAY POLL SHOWS BIDEN CONTINUES TO LEAD.
JOINING ME NOW NBCS VAUGHN HILLYARD ON THE TRAIL.
WHATS IT LOOK LIKE OUT THERE?
Reporter YEAH THIS IS WHAT THE SCENES IN IOWA IN THE SUMMERTIME BEGIN TO LOOK LIKE.
WITH KAMALA HARRIS IN THE WHITE IN WEST DES MOINES PICNIC.
BEFORE YOU TOSS TO ME I SAW SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR WALK IN BETWEEN THE CANDIDATE THEYRE THE TWO MAIN CANDIDATES HERE GOING TO ADDRESS SEVERAL HUNDRED FOLKS HERE IN WEST DES MOINES.
AND SHE HAS A TOWN HALL LATER IN THE DAY.
AND THAT CONVERSATION IS WHAT DO YOU TAKE FROM A CANDIDATE FROM THE DEBATE STAGE WHERE KAMALA HARRIS THROUGH THE CONTRASTS WITH JOE BIDEN.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?
WELL YOU CAN SAY ITS BASICALLY THE SECOND INNING.
WELL CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT THE MESSAGE IS HERE.
THE FIRST STOP OVER THE COURSE OF THREE DAYS THEN NEW ORLEANS AND SOUTH CAROLINA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY.
VAUGHAN EARLIER WHEN I TALKED TO YOU AND I ASKED YOU WHAT KAMALA HARRIS IS GOING TO DO FILL THE SPACE BETWEEN THOSE MOMENTS THAT SHE TENDS TO HAVE INCLUDING THE ONE ON THE DEBATE STAGE THAT COST THE INCREASE IN POLLING YOU MENTIONED CAMPAIGNING.
DOES SHE HAVE SOME SORT OF STRATEGY AS FAR AS YOU KNOW OF TO MAINTAIN THIS MOMENTUM?
BECAUSE PART OF IT IS SO MANY MORE EYES ARE ON HER.
Reporter EXACTLY LOOK AT THIS IN A PLACE LIKE IOWA IT COMES DOWN TO THE TELEVISION MARKET.
RIGHT HERE IN THE DES MOINES TELEVISION MARKET.
TOMORROW IN COUNCIL BLUFFS.
TOMORROW IN SIOUX CITY.
ITS GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT ESSENTIALLY BRINGING IN LOCAL TELEVISION CAMERAS HERE.
ENGAGING IN THAT CONVERSATION THROUGH IT.
SHE RAISED 3 MILLION OVER THE COURSE OF THREE DAYS AFTER THE DEBATE.
SHE HAS 65 STAFFERS HERE ON THE GROUND IN IOWA.
SHOULD WHILE SHE MAY TAKE A STOP HERE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS ITS THE STAFFERS YOU CAN SEE THE STAFFERS ESSENTIALLY GETTING NAMES PHONE NUMBERS TO COMMIT TO CAUCUS TO VOLUNTEER.
KAMALA HARRIS ONE HUMAN BEING SHE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.
SHES HUMAN.
AND THEN THEY PUT OUT THAT CONVERSATION WHERE THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN BELIEVES THEY HAVE A REAL SHOT TO WIN HERE.
BARACK OBAMA WON HERE IN 2008.
SHE BELIEVES LASTLY YOU JUST HEARD THE NAME.
A LOT OF TIME AT THESE EVENTS ALI IT COMES DOWN TO LOCAL POLITICS.
THE SENATE CANDIDATE WHO WILL LIKELY TAKE ON JONI ERNST SHES HERE AT THIS RALLY.
ITS BEING OUT HERE TO SUPPORT THEM WHICH AMY KLOBUCHAR AND KAMALA HARRIS IS DOING TODAY.
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ALSO SPENDING HIS DAY IN IOWA AFTER HIS CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED RAISED 21.5 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER.
JUST TO COMPARE THAT TO PETE BUTTIGIEG HE BROUGHT IN 24.8 MILLION BERNIE SANDERS 8 MILLION.
JOINING ME NOW FROM CEDAR RAPIDS IOWA MIKE ITS A GOOD F FUNDRAISING HAUL BUT ITS NOT BEEN GREAT FOR JOE BIDEN?
Reporter YOURE RIGHT ALI ITS SOMETHING WEVE SEEN FROM THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN SINCE THE START IN APRIL.
ANYTIME THEYVE GONE THROUGH A ROUGH PATCH BEEN DEALING WITH CONTROVERSY THEY OFTEN TRY TO PIVOT THE STORY LINE BACK TO A POSITION OF STRENGTH.
SOMETIMES THATS RETURNING THE DISCUSSION FROM DEBATE BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THATS OF COURSE THE BIG ELECTABILITY ARGUMENT THATS THE CORNERSTONE OF BIDENS SUPPORT IN THE POLLS.
TODAY AS EVERYONE IS GETTING READY TO HEAD OUT TO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND THEYRE DEALING WITH THAT FALLOUT WE SAW THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PUT OUT THAT FUNDRAISING NUMBER 21 MILLION.
ITS NOT AS HIGH AS PETE BUTTIGIEG.
BUT THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN POINTING OUT THEY HADNT BEEN IN THE RACE FOR THAT FULL 90DAY PERIOD.
IF YOU AVERAGE IT OUT PER DAY HE DID IN FACT RAISE MORE MONEY THAN ANY CONTENDERS AT LEAST FROM WHO WEVE HEARD SO FAR.
90 OF DONATIONS COME FROM SMALL DONORS FROM GRASSROOTS SUPPORTERS IN LESS THAN 200 INCREMENTS.
AND THEYRE HIGHDOLLAR FUNDRAISING AS WELL.
WHATS IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ALSO WANTS TO POINT OUT A DOLLAR FOR JOE BIDEN LOW ITS A LOT LONGER THAN A DOLLAR FOR EVEN KAMALA HARRIS.
WE TALK ABOUT IT A LOT ON OUR AIR BUT MAYBE THE AVERAGE VOTER DOESNT HAVE A LOT OF RECOGNITION IN.
BIDEN IS PUTTING THAT MONEY INTO INVESTMENTS IN THE GROUND GAME.
THEY HAVE 50 PAID STAFF HERE IN IOWA.
THEY DOUBLED THAT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
YES HELL SPEND THAT IN TV ADS DOWN THE ROAD BUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADS FOR TV JUST SO VOTERS GET TO KNOW HIM.
THANK YOU MIKE.
THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT FINED FACEBOOK OVER 2 MILLION OR UNDERREPORTING HATE SPEECH ON ITS PLATFORM.
THERE WERE MORE COMMENTS ABOUT ANTISEMITIC CONTENT THAN FACEBOOK LET ON.
ITS SMALL GIMP THE COMPANYS SIZE IT DRAWS ATTENTION HOWEVER TO THE EMBATTLED SOCIAL MEDIA FLASH B CLASHES TO OTHER WORLD POWERS AS HATE SPEECH EMERGES.
THIS IS A TOPIC OF DEBATE WITH GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
JOINING ME NOW THE PRESIDENT OF COLOR OF CHANGE WHICH IS THE NATIONS LARGEST ONLINE RACIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION.
AND HES MET WITH FACEBOOKS CHIEF OFFICER SHERYL SANDBERG A DOZEN TIME.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
BE HERE.
THERES A CONTEXT PARTICULARLY IN GERMAN AS A RESULT OF THE HOLOCAUST THEYRE HYPER SENSITIVE TOWARDS THE HATE SPEECH AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT CAN CATCH ON.
IT DOES SEEM THAT THE EUROPEANS ARE FURTHER AHEAD THAN AMERICANS IN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE?
ABSOLUTELY.
THE FINE IS SMALL AS YOU SAID.
BUT THE SYMBOL OF THE FINE THE HOLDING AN INSTITUTION LIKE FACEBOOK ACCOUNTABLE IS SERIOUS.
AND UNFORTUNATELY WEVE NOT HAD THAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT FROM THE FTC HERE FROM CONGRESS FROM THE AUTHORITIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE STEPPING IN WHEN INSTITUTIONS COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORMS OTHERS DO NOT.
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
IS IT A WILL THING?
AN UNDERSTANDING?
ITS A COUPLE THINGS.
FIRST OF ALL ITS A WILL THING.
THING WHEN IT COMES TO CONGRESS.
ITS BECOME POLITICIZED ON BOTH SIDES.
AND I DONT WANT TO CREATE FALSE EEI DIDNT FEEL.
BUT THE FTV WINS SETTLEMENTS OR GET FINES AND NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OR HOLD ACCOUNTABLE ONCE FACEBOOK GOES BACK AND VIOLATES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE CALLED OUT ON THE FIRST PLACE.
YOU HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SHERYL SANDBERG IN FACT HES HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE CENSUS COMING OUT.
YOU CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE PUTTING FALSE NEWS OUT ABOUT THE CENSUS AND THAT MESSING UP THE COUNT?
YES YOU CANNOT FILL OUT YOUR CENSUS ON FACEBOOK.
TO THAT POINT YOU KNOW THIS WAS PART OF LONGTERM WORK WEVE BEEN DOING AT COLOR OF CHANGE.
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WEVE BEEN PURCHASING THE ORGANIZATION TO GET REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS WORK.
AND BACK IN NOVEMBER THEY GOT THEM TO COMMIT TO PUBLICLY RELEASING THEIR SILL RIG CIVIL AUDIT.
THEY DID THE FIRST PHASE IN NOVEMBER WHICH WAS WEAK.
THIS LAST PHASE THAT THEY RELEASED ON SUNDAY SHOWED MORE PROGRESS.
SINCE SHERYL SANDBERG HAS TAKEN OVER THE AUDIT AND PUT IT IN HER OFFICE.
WE HAVE SEEN A MARKET CHANGE IN HER COMMITMENT TO ACTUALLY TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.
FOR US METRIC OF SUCCESS IS A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
WE WANT THEM TO DEAL WITH HOW DO THEY TREAT THE CENSUS LIKE THE ELECTION.
AS A BIG EVENT WHERE ALL FORCES COME IN BECAUSE THERES A LOT THAT INFLUENCES IT.
USE RACIAL APPEALS USE OTHER THINGS TO SUPPRESS TURNOUTS TO SUPPRESS PARTICIPATION.
SO PART OF THIS IS THAT FACEBOOK MAKES A LOT OF MONEY.
ITS THE LARGEST COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM IN THE WORLD.
AND THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT MOVES US INTO THE FUTURE DOESNT DRAG US INTO THE PAST.
ALL RIGHT.
SO LETS TALK ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION THATS BEEN ORDERED BY THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTO THE SECRET FACEBOOK POSTS THAT HAD ALMOST 10000 PEOPLE ON IN WHICH THEY WERE SAYING REMARKABLY SEXIST MISOGYNIST RACIST THINGS ABOUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND MIGRANTS.
LOOK ITS 10000 PEOPLE.
WE DONT MEAN THAT TO TAINT THE GOOD WORK OF THOSE IN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL NOT INVOLVED.
TALK ABOUT THIS THIS IS A SECRET GROUP.
WE ONLY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN IT LEAKED THE INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT HAD GONE TOO FAR.
DOES FACEBOOK HAVE A ROLE IN THAT?
YEAH FACEBOOK THESE PRIVATE GROUPS THEY MINE THE DATA AND DATA AND THEY WORK TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THAT DATA.
SO THEYVE CREATED THESE PRIVATE GROUPS.
AND THEN THEY HAVE COMMUNITY STANDARDS ABOUT HATE.
ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN SAY AND WHAT DO ON THEIR PLATFORM.
AND THAT APPLIES?
IT SHOULD IT DOES APPLY AND IT NEEDS TO APPLY NO MATTER HOW POWERFUL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT ARE.
THE TRICK IS ITS OKAY TO HAVE TRAFFIC RULES RIGHT?
YEAH.
BUT THE TRAFFIC RULES ONLY MATTER IF THEY APPLY TO ALL OF US.
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THESE PRIVATE GROUPS CANT EXIST ON THEIR PLATFORM AND ALLOW FOR THE SOWING OF HATE.
AND FACEBOOK HAS A ROLE IN THIS.
I ALSO THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE.
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE FELT SO COMFORTABLE.
IN A SPACE  LAW ENFORCEMENT  FIGURES THAT GET A GUN AND BADGE AND ARE SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY FELT SO COMFORTABLE TO SAY SUCH HATEFUL AND DEROGATORY THINKS ABOUT PEOPLE IN PERIL AND ELECTED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN 10000 IN THE GROUP.
DID FACEBOOK MAKE THEM SAY THESE THINGS?
PEOPLE HAD RACIST MISOGYNIST THINGS TO SAY.
DO WE WIN IF WE GET IT OFF OF FAB?
NO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE WAY TECHNOLOGY AND NEW TOOLS ALLOW FOR INFORMATION TO MOVE QUICKER RIGHT?
ITS LIKE LIGHTING A MATCH IS ONE THING.
LIGHTING A MATCH NEXT TO LIGHTER FLUID IS A DIFFERENT THING.
IN MANY WAYS WHETHER ITS YOUTUBE FACEBOOK OR TWITTER THESE PLATFORMS CAN BE THE LIGHTER FLUID.
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT.
AND WE HAVE TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO HOW THIS INFORMATION CAN SPREAD IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
YEAH SOMEONE CAN SAY HATEFUL THINGS OUT ON THE STREET.
AND THATS FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THEY YOU KNOW NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES THEIR JOB OR WORKPLACE OR WHATEVER.
RIGHT RIGHT.
BUT ITS FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
ITS DIFFERENT WHEN YOU GO INTO A GROUP.
YOU ARE A LAW ENFORCEMENT FIGURE YOU DONT KNOW THE OTHER 10000 PEOPLE IN THAT GROUP.
AND YOU FEEL SO COMFORTABLE SAYING THESE THING AND DOING THESE THINGS YES THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.
THERES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL OF US RIGHT?
IN THE WORKPLACE.
IF I WAS ON A GROUP LIKE THAT ID PROBABLY GET HIRED.
YOUD GET FIRED.
THE PROBLEM IS WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT LESS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT?
WHY SHOULD WE LET THEM OFF THE HOOK?
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE THE IMAGES HORRIFIC IMAGES COMING FROM THE BORDER RIGHT NOW.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VERY BEST PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN THIS EFFORT.
AND THATS NOT WHATS HAPPENING.
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS ONCE AGAIN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BRING US TOGETHER SHOULD NOT DRAG US BACK.
RASHAD GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
PRESIDENT OF COLOR OF CHANGE.
STILL AHEAD DEMOCRATIC VOTERS THINK ITS A GREAT IDEA MEDICARE FOR ALL.
NEW POLLING SHOWS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THE PLAN WITHIN THE PARTY.
WHILE SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY CAMPAIGNING HARD ON THE ISSUE.
OTHERS SEEM TO BE WAITING FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION BEFORE THEY PUSH HARD ON HEALTH CARE.
WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SPLIT STRATEGY AFTER THE BREAK.
YOU ARE WATCHING MSNBC.

THE 20 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN MIAMI LAST WEEK TOUCHED ON A NUMBER OF MAJOR ISSUES AMONG HEM ECONOMY IMMIGRATION HEALTH CARE AND CLIMATE CHANGE.
BUT THOSE DO THEY MATTER TO THE VOTERS WHO ARE GOING TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO TAKE ON PRESIDENT TRUMP NEXT YEAR?
A NEW WASHINGTON POSTABC NEWS POLL FINDS 89 OF THOSE SURVEYED SAYS HEALTH CARE IS THE TOP ISSUE IN THE 2020 ELECTION JUST AS IT WAS IN THE 2018 ELECTION.
GUN VIOLENCE WAS NEXT FOLLOWED BY WOMENS ISSUES.
IF THERES ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO CAN READ WHAT THOSE THINGS SAY I CANT TELL.
THERE WE GO IMMIGRATION.
WOMENS ISSUES IMMIGRATION 80 AT GLOBAL WARMING.
THEN THE ECONOMY.
FOREIGN POLICY ABORTION AND TAXES AS OF THE LEAST CONCERN TO DEMOCRATIC LEANING VOTERS.
JOINING ME NOW DAN BALL WASHINGTON POST CHIEF CORRESPONDENT.
DAN GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MY PLEASURE ALI.
DAN THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS HEALTH CARE AND HOW BIG A DEAL IT IS FOR DEMOCRATIC LEANING VOTERS AND HOW MANY SUPPORT MEDICARE WITH SOME PROPOSAL OF IT.
THE MORNING COUNCIL POLL FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL SHOWS OF ALL VOTERS A SMALL MAJORITY SUPPORT A MEDICARE FOR ALL.
77 OF DEMOCRATS DO.
HALF 6 INDEPENDENTS DO.
27 OF REPUBLICANS DO.
IT DOES SEEM SUPPORT FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL OR SOMETHING LIKE IT IS A WINNING STRATEGY FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.
WELL I THINK THERES THREE QUESTIONS.
ONE IS WHERE DO PEOPLE STAND ON MEDICARE OR ALL OF OUR GOVERNMENTRUN SINGLE PAYOR SYSTEM.
THATS THE FIRST QUESTION.
THE SECOND IS IF YOURE IN FAVOR OF MEDICARE FOR ALL GOVERNMENTRUN SYSTEM WOULD YOU BE IN FAVOR OF THAT IF YOU KNEW THAT PRIVATE INSURANCE WAS GOING TO GO AWAY.
WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR POLL THERES OVERWHELMING SUPPORT AMONG THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SELFIDENTIFIED DEMOCRATS AND DEMOCRATIC LEANING INDEPENDENTS FOR A MEDICARE FOR ALL KIND OF PROGRAM.
AND TWOTHIRDS OF DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF THAT EVEN IF IT MEANT THE END OF PRIVATE INSURANCE.
AMONG THE HARD CORE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OR AMONG THE BROAD SCALE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THERES QUITE A SUPPORT FOR IT.
WE KNOW AMONG THE CANDIDATES VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS IN ONE PLACE.
HES RESISTANT TO GO THAT FAR.
SENATORS SANDERS AND HARRIS HAVE COME DOWN STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF MEDICARE FOR ALL EVEN IF THAT DOES MEAN THE END FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE HARRIS HAS EQUIVOCATED ON WHETHER SHES IN FAVOR OF MAINTAINING THAT OR SOME PRIVATE INSURANCE.
THATS THE DEBATE WERE GOING TO SEE PLAY OUT.
AND I THINK THE QUESTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO MEDICARE FOR ALL AND AN END TO PRIVATE INSURANCE HOW STRONGLY DO THEY MAKE THAT CASE.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW IN THE DEBATE ALI WAS SENATO BENNETT SAYS THERES A MORE UNIVERSAL WAY TO DO IT.
THATS THE DEBATE WERE GOING TO SEE.
DAN MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE SOME FORM OF UNIVERSAL CARE UNIVERSAL INSURANCE COVERAGE.
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO GET AT THIS.
MY SENSE COMING UP WITH MEDICARE FOR ALL I HAPPEN TO LIKE AS A CANADIAN BECAUSE ITS VERY SIMILAR TO THE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN CANADA.
BUT IT CONFUSES THE ISSUETHERE ARE PEOPLE IN FAVOR OF MEDICARE FOR ALL.
THEN AS YOU SAY WHEN YOU ADD IN YOUR POLL DID ADD IN THE QUESTION IS THAT OKAY IF YOU ELIMINATE YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE I THINK ITS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE HAVE AGAINST THE VARIOUS COMPETING SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT WHAT WE HAVE NOW.
WELL THERES ALWAYS GOING TO BE A MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN YOURE TALKING ABOUT TOTALLY REVAMPING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.
WE SAW THAT IN THE DEBATE OVER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
WE SAW THAT IN THE DEBATE OVER THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.
EVERY TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CONGRESS HAVE BEGUN TO TINKER OR RADICALLY CHANGE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THERE IS A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS ON PART OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE INSURANCE.
ONE OF THE REALITIES IS AS YOU KNOW UNDER OUR MEDICARE SYSTEM THERE IS PRIVATE INSURANCE.
MANY MOST IF NOT ALL MEDICARE RECIPIENTS HAVE OR NEED SOME KIND OF ADDITIONAL INSURANCE TO PAY FOR THE COSTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE.
SO THERE ARE ALL THESE ASPECTS OF IT.
SO PART OF IT IS A BROAD DEBATE KIND OF WHATS THE BEST WAY.
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THE CANDIDATES HAVE HEARD ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IS BEYOND THE QUESTION OF WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM DO WE HAVE THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES IT COST?
RIGHT.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
AND PEOPLES CONCERNED ABOUT RISING COSTS.
THATS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH.
AGAIN ITS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATE RIGHT?
THERES A QUESTION OF WHAT THINGS COST BUT THERE ISNT A REALLY GOOD ACTUARIAL OR ACTUAL CALCULATION OF THE COST OR COST OF CURRENT SYSTEM.
WOULD IT BE EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO DIGEST IF IT WAS WELL PRICED OUT AND COMPARED TO AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DONT?
WELL THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
BUT AS WEVE SEEN IN PAST DEBATES GETTING THOSE COST ESTIMATES OR GETTING PEOPLE TO AGREE ON THOSE COST ESTIMATES IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT PROPOSITION.
AND YOU GET THEM COMING FROM PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IDEOLOGICAL VIEWPOINTS.
AND DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS.
AND DIFFERENT POLITICAL INTERESTS.
SO THE DEBATE OVER WHAT THE ACTUAL COST IS AS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES AS WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF A NEW SYSTEM VERSUS THE CURRENT SYSTEM.
DAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOROUGH COVERAGE.

HUNDREDS GATHERED IN NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING TO MOURN THE LOSS OF A SEPTEMBER 11 HERO.
53YEAROLD NYPD DETECTIVE LUIS ALVAREZ WAS LAID TO REST IN QUEENS NEW YORK.
HE DIED SATURDAY IN HOSS PIN CARE FOLLOWING A THREEYEAR BATTLE WITH CANCER AND 60 ROUNDS OF CHEMOTHERAPY.
ALVAREZ ATTRIBUTED HIS CANCER TO THE THREE MONTHS HE SPENT AT GROUND ZERO FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS.
PLEADED FOR BENEFITS FOR HIS FELLOW 911 RESPONDERS.
I SHOULD NOT BE HERE WITH YOU BUT YOU MADE ME COME.
COME BECAUSE I WILL NOT STAND BY AND WATCH AS MY FRIENDS WITH CANCER FROM 911 LIKE ME ARE VALUED LESS THAN ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE OF WHEN THEY GET SICK THEY DIE.
AMONG THE MANY WHO ATTENDED WERE COMEDIAN AND ACTOR JON STEWART WHO JOINED HIM IN THE FIGHT FOR THE HEALTH BENEFIT.
YOU SEE HIM HERE SALUTING ALVAREZ IN THE FINAL GOODBYE.
NEXT YOU SEE NEW YORK CONGRESSWOMAN MARIE MARONEY WHO WAS THERE TO PAY HER RESPECT TO THE FALLEN HERO.
CONGRESSWOMAN THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
THANK YOU FOR REMEMBERING AND DETECTIVE ALVAREZ.
WHAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERE GIVEN HE WAS A WARRIOR REALLY.
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT.
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS THERE FROM THE HEAD HUNDREDS OF POLICE NOT ONLY FROM NEW YORK BUT OTHER AREAS HIS EXTENDED FAMILY.
HE WAS AT THE PARISH HE WAS RAISED IN AND MANY MANY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THERE.
IT WAS A HUGE GATHERING.
HE WAS BORN IN CUBA.
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 6 YEARS OLD AND RAISED IN THIS PARISH.
HES THE AMERICAN DREAM.
HE JOINED THE MARINES JOINED THE POLICE FORCE WAS A DECORATED OFFICER AND DETECTIVE IN NARCOTICS AND LATER BOMBS.
I SAY HES A HERO TRUE AMERICAN HERO AND WORKING TO PASS THE 911 VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND.
YOU REMEMBER BACK TO THOSE DAYS.
WHAT DID WE GET WRONG ABOUT THIS WHEN IT CAME TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS?
NO ONE WILL FORGET THAT DAY WHEN PEOPLE WERE RUNNING FAR AWAY FROM THE BUILDINGS AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS RAN THE OTHER WAY.
THEY RAN INTO IT AND WE LOST 3000 PEOPLE MOST OF THEM RESPONDERS ON THAT DAY.
AND WE WILL LOSE MANY MORE THOUSANDS MORE BECAUSE OF THOSE THAT WORKED AT THE PILE.
AND ITS A DOUBLE OUTRAGE IN A SENSE BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY VICTIMS OF THE WAR ON TERROR BUT OUR GOVERNMENTS THAT SAID ITS SAFE COME BACK AND WORK.
OF COURSE ITS NOT.
THE EPA SAID IT WOULD BE FACE.
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WE REMEMBER THAT PLUME THAT WENT ON  SIX MONTHS.
YOU COULD SEE IT.
SMELL IT ANYWHERE IN NEW YORK.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
THEY WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
THEY WERE GOING TO DO THEIR JOBS AND THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THEIR JOBS BUT THEY WORRIED THEY WERE IN DANGER AT THE TIME AND THEY WERE TOLD BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY WERE SAFE.
FOR THOSE WHO SAY THIS IS A NEW YORK PROBLEM THEY WERE RELYING ON INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYING YOURE GOOD KEEP ON WORKING.
YOU GOT IT RIGHT.
NOT ONLY IS THERE A RESPONSIBILITY AS VETERANS AGAINST TERROR BUT THEYRE ALSO THE VETERANS OF MISINFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT THEY SERVED.
WE COULD NEVER REPAY WHAT THEY GAVE THEIR LIFE AND HEALTH.
BUT THIS IS ONE WAY WE CAN MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER AND THOSE OF THEIR FAMILIES THAT MANY OF THEM ARE LEAVING BEHIND.
THEY ARE NOT THERE TO PROTECT THEM.
WE NEED TO GIVE THEM SUPPORT.
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO GET DONE?
I BELIEVE IT WILL GET DOWN AND IM HOPING TO GET IT ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE NEXT WEEK AND SEND IT TO THE SENATE WHERE MITCH McCONNELL SAYS HE HOPES TO PASS AND IT WILL PASS IT FROM THE AUGUST RECESS.
KEEPING AT HIS WORD LETS GET OUR WORK DONE IN THE HOUSE AND SEND THE BILL OVER TO HIM.
CONGRESSWOMAN MALONEY THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
i It all comes downi i to a single defining moment...i i ...when a plan stops being ai i plan and gets set into motion.i i Todays Merrilli i can help you get therei i with the people toolsi i and personalized advicei i to help turn your ambitionsi i into action.i i What would you likei i the power to do?i IM ALEX TREBEK HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM.
