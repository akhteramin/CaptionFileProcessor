have an impact on people's lives.
-One of the most important bands to ever walk the earth.
Their influence will never, ever go away.
-They had the perfect combination with the classic lineup.
They had the personalities that could create friction, that created great music,
and they don't come along very often.
-It was just a giant firework display that was just the best you've ever seen,
but it wasn't built to last.
It exploded into the sky, and we all went, "Ahh," and it was gone. Fabulous.
We have a death.
We need to confirm identification and then we need to perform an autopsy.
The lead singer of the rock band Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, has died of a gunshot wound in Seattle.
'The world was stunned when Kurt Cobain, the 27-year-old musician and self-styled prince of grunge, was found dead.'
Kurt Cobain was a genius.
He was the powerful voice of a generation.
true artist.
Even in his pain, he was genuine.
'But with success came pressures that Kurt found hard to handle.'
He worked so hard to become a millionaire rock star.
And then once he did, he didn't like it very much.
'And on April 8th, 1994, when Kurt Cobain was found dead at his Seattle mansion, it appeared to be a clear-cut case of suicide.'
Kurt was the poster boy for suicide.
I said, "He's going to kill himself."
'But despite leaving a suicide note, many people refused to believe that Kurt Cobain had taken his own life.'
I knew from the beginning that Kurt had been murdered.
Kurt Cobain's death certificate says that he died from a single shotgun wound to the head.
But why would a man who's just achieved his lifelong goal of becoming a rock star and starting a family kill himself?
Could foul play have been involved?
'Dr.
Michael Hunter is a world-renowned forensic pathologist and the Chief Medical Examiner in one of America's biggest cities.
He's performed over 4,000 autopsies to investigate and reveal the cause of death.'
Kurt Cobain's investigative records show that he died from a shotgun wound to the head, fired through the mouth.
But why would a man who has struggled to make it as a musician and who'd just started a family, kill himself?
I'm gonna use all the available evidence to investigate what happened to Kurt both mentally... ..and physically and discover more about why he died.
'2:30pm.
Four days before Kurt Cobain's death.
Kurt is at the Exodus Recovery Center in Marina Del Rey.
He's trying to kick the heroin addiction he's developed since becoming a rock star.'
One of the people he smoked a cigarette with outside said that Kurt just seemed like a happy-go-lucky guy, without a problem in the world.
He seemed very excited about life.
'Kurt had only recently become a millionaire, after a lifetime of financial hardship, and had just bought himself a mansion in an exclusive area of Seattle, where he lived with his wife Courtney Love and his 19-month-old baby, Frances Bean.
In a recently discovered interview, recorded a few months before his death, Kurt claimed he'd never been happier.'
Ever since I've been married and I've had a child within the last year, everything my whole mental state and my physical state - has almost improved 100 per cent.
I've never been more optimistic.
But within five days of appearing optimistic about the future, Kurt Cobain was dead.
He was 27 and he joins a long list of stars who died at this age, including Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and Amy Winehouse.
It's an exclusive club.
And I want to find out what led Kurt to join it.
'Kurt Donald Cobain was born on February 20th, 1967, in Aberdeen, a small industrial town located two hours south of Seattle.'
Aberdeen was a logging town where everybody was macho.
He certainly wasn't the type who was gonna go out and cut down trees.
'Kurt's dad was a mechanic and his mother was a waitress.
But his upbringing was far from easy.'
The whole Cobain family was dysfunctional.
I'm talking all of us.


The dysfunctional part, I think, was that he was living with parents who were using more alcohol than normal.
And it's hard for you to be a happy little kid if you're growing up in a family that's fighting and who don't really know how to raise children.
(KURT) I was ashamed of my parents.
I couldn't face some of my friends at school.
Because I desperately wanted to have the classic, typical family mother, father.
I wanted that security.
'Kurt's parents separated when he was nine.
He found solace in music, which he showed promise at from an early age.
He was a child prodigy, who possessed this rare, unique artistic talent.
(BEV) Music saved Kurt.
I think it was the only way he knew to express his feelings.
I really do think it was therapeutic for him.
'Kurt started by playing the drums before moving on to guitar.
But it wasn't until he was 18 that he met Chris Novoselic and formed the band Nirvana.
It was Kurt's approach that would be at the forefront of a new style of music.
How he was able to take punk music... ..old rock 'n' roll, minimalist melodic music, stick it all in a soup and come out with what he did, I think that was pretty revolutionary.
'This fusion of rock and punk became known as grunge.
It is epitomized in their iconic track Smells Like Teen Spirit.'
# With the lights out, it's less dangerous # Here we are now, entertain us # I feel stupid and contagious # Here we are now, entertain us # A mulatto... 'Nirvana's album Nevermind, released in 1991, went to the top of the charts around the world, and established Kurt Cobain as the biggest rock star of his generation.
In February 1992, Kurt married the former stripper and lead singer of the band Hole, Courtney Love.'
As soon as she married him, I listened to a lot of his poetry and a lot of his music and I thought, "This guy's pretty profound."
(BEV) I think he was popular because he was wounded.
He looked like a person who was down on his luck and rebellious.
So I think the kids could really relate to that.
(IAN) He spoke to this lost generation.
And became the voice of the generation.
This is a photograph of Nirvana, taken six months prior to Kurt Cobain's death.
And I'm surprised at how small Kurt is.
Bass guitarist Chris Novoselic is incredibly tall.
He's six foot six inches.
And drummer David Grohl is six feet tall.
According to his records, Kurt was five-nine, but looked considerably smaller.
This could be due to a disorder he was suffering from, called scoliosis.
And in this recently discovered interview, Kurt sheds new light on what he thought caused this condition.
I had scoliosis when I was in junior high.
I've been playing guitar ever since.
The weight of the guitar has made my back grow in this curvature.
So when I stand, everything's sideways.
(DR. HUNTER) Scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, occurs in about three per cent of people.
It most commonly arises in the teenage years.
The curve is usually either S-shaped, with two bends, or C-shaped with one.
His music felt like he was always in pain, that he was angst-ridden.
That's a typical reflection of the scoliosis that he battled with.
It's a common misconception that scoliosis causes pain.
But that is not always the case.
And the cause is oftentimes unknown.
This is an X-ray of Kurt Cobain's spine.
It shows that he had C-shaped scoliosis.
This wouldn't be caused by the weight of his guitar but it could be exacerbated by it.
As there is no mention of any pain or psychological distress associated with this condition, I don't believe that this was responsible for his death.
However, Kurt did suffer from another long-standing medical condition that had a huge impact on him.
So I want to investigate whether it led him to take his own life.
I remember putting on a brave face to hide my symptoms of depression.
I was on an antidepressant.
But I still had depression symptoms...
It was tough getting through the day... hiding how I really felt.
Something had to change.
So I talked to my doctor for real.
No more saying, “Oh, I'm fine.”
This time, I spoke up about living behind the mask.
And he told me about REXULTI.
He said that REXULTI, when added to an antidepressant, ... has been proven to help reduce symptoms of depression.
