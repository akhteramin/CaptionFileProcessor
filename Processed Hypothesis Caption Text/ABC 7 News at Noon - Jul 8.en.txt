 REPORTING LIVE FROM CONSTITUTION AND SEVENTH NATHAN BUCKET ABC7 NEWS.
Lindsey: NATHAN, ENJOY IT DOWN THERE AND THAT IS JUST ONE OF MANY PARADES GOING ON IN OUR AREA.
 THE STREETS OF ARLINGTON. IT WAS PACKED THERE FOR THE ANNUAL PARADE.
 THIS EVENING PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO GIVE HIS SALUTE TO AMERICA WITH INDEPENDENCE EXTRAVAGANZA FEATURING TANKS, MILITARY FLYOVERS AND A SPEECH AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL. SOME SAY THE PRESIDENT IS POLITICIZING A NATIONAL HOLIDAY
 BUT WE HAVE THE VERY LATEST.
 Reporter: IT WILL BE THE SHOW OF A LIFETIME, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PROMISED ON TWITTER AHEAD OF HRAVAGANT FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
 A COSTLY PRODUCTION THAT TRUMP HAS ALSO PROMISED WILL BE WORTH THE EXPENSE
WITH AN ARRAY OF MILITARY HARDWARE ON DISPLAY THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL, INCLUDING TANKS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN USHERED IN
 THE SALUTE TO AMERICA SPECTACLE WILL ALSO INCLUDE MULTIPLE MILITARY FLYOVERS AND AN EXTENDED FIREWORKS SHOW TOPPED OFF WITH A SPEECH FROM THE COMMANDER IN  CHIEF  HIMSELF.
 WE WILL HAVE PLANES GONG OVERHEAD,
THE BEST FIGHTER JETS IN THE WORLD AND OTHER PLANES,
THE EVENT IS SETTING OF MORE THAN PYROTECHNIC DEVICES
BUT IT IS ALSO SPARKING BACKLASH FROM CRITICS WHO ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF STAGING GLORIFIED CAMPAIGN RALLY AND TURNING THE CELEBRATION INTO A PARTISAN EVENT.
 THE EVENT IS FREE BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS GIVEN VIP TICKETS TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND TOP DONORS
 BUT CARSON AND 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SETH MOULTON CALLING THE TRUMP CELEBRATION, UN-AMERICAN.
 IT REMINDS ME OF THE SOVIET UNION.
 IT IS UNPATRIOTIC BECAUSE, MILITARISM IS NOT WHAT AMERICAN PATRIOTISM IS ABOUT. ABOUT.
Reporter: AS FOR THE PRICE TAG BUT RATHER THE MINISTRATION NOR THE PENTAGON HAS SCHOOLS WITH THE COST WILL BE TO TAXPAYERS. WE HAVE LEARNED THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE IS DIVERTING $2.
5 PROJECTS
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDING OVERNIGHT, THE FIREWORKS HAVE BEEN DONATED AND THE COST WILL BE VERY LITTLE COMPARED TO WHAT IT IS WORTH. THE $750,000 OF TARIFFS WERE DONATED BY AN OHIO COMPANY THAT LOBBIED THE PRESIDENT LAST MONTH TO HOLD OFF ON THE TARIFFS FOR CHINA.
 THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HE WOULD DO SO THE SAME DAY HE ANNOUNCED THE DONATION.
