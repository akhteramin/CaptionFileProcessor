THE EVENT IS FREE BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS GIVEN VIP TICKETS TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND TOP DONORS BUT CARSON AND 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SETH MOULTON CALLING THE TRUMP CELEBRATION UNAMERICAN.

THEY TREATED THAT THE FORM OF COMMERCE ANTIOQUIA WORKING HARD ON THIS HOLIDAY TO KEEP THAT QUESTION.S TREVOR AULT REPORTS A JUDGES ORDER DEMONSTRATION TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT BY TOMORROW.
WEEK REMOVED SUPREME COURT DECISION BLOCKING DEMONSTRATION FROM ADDING A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE 2020 CENSUS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOTIFIED JOINING THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS EVEN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.
THAT MESSAGE CONTRADICTING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CENSUS FORMS ARE BEING PRINTED WITHOUT THE QUESTION ARE YOU A U.S. CITIZEN.
I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY IS A CITIZEN AS OPPOSED TO AN ILLEGAL.
WHAT A PERSON IS INSISTENT THAT THE FIGHT FOR THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS ONGOING HIS COMMENTS HAVE SPARKED CONFUSION.
MARYLAND FEDERAL JUDGE CONVENED A CONFERENCE CALL ON WAS AFTER SHE SAW THE PRESENCE TO SAYING THAT REPORTS THAT THE QUESTION HAD BEEN DROPPED OR FAKE.
ON THE CALL THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN THE PRESIDENTS RHETORIC BUT WHENWE ARE SICK THE TWEET THIS ONE WAS THE FIRST I HAD HEARD OF THE PRESIDENTS POSITION ON THIS ISSUE.
I DO NOT HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT MEANS AT THIS JUNCTURE OTHER THAN WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID ADMIT THAT THE PRESIDENT CONTRADICTED THEM  BUT SAID THEY HAVE BEEN STARTED TO EXPLORE WHETHER THERE IS A PATH FOR CONSISTENT WITH THE SUPREME COURT TO ALLOW THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY ARGUED THEY NEEDED THE CENSUS QUESTION TO BETTER ENFORCE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SHOT DOWN THAT LINE OF THINKING CONTROL AND WOULD.
THE COURT RULED THAT THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WAS NOT ABOUT WHATEVER COCKAMAMIE REASON THAT DONALD TRUMP GAVE FOR IT.
WHILE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS FOLLOWING THE PRESENCE INSTRUCTIONS THEY ARE RUNNING LOW ON TIME.
THE ONLY HAVE UNTIL TOMORROW TO EXPAND TO THE COURTS HOW THEY PLAN TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURTS RULING.

Lindsey SEVEN IS ON THE SIDE WITH A SUMMER HOLIDAY WARNING.
ACCORDING TO THE CDC DROWNING IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF UNINTENTIONAL DEATHS IN CHILDREN AGES 1 TO 4.
BEFORE YOU HEAD TO THE POOL OR THE BEACHES WILL BE THE FOURTH GIO BENITEZ IS TAKING LOOK ON HOW TO KEEP HER FAMILY SAFE.
IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER SUMMER POOL PARTY PRETTY YOUNG PEOPLE SPLASHING IN THE WATER.
PARENTS ENJOYING THE BARBECUE.
SOMEWHERE IN THIS POOL FIVE DIFFERENT SWIMMERS ARE ABOUT TO SIMULATE THAT THEY ARE DROWNING.
WE ARE WONDERING IF THESE MOMS AND DADS CAN SPOT THEM.
DROWNING CAN HAPPEN IN JUST SECONDS AND IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO SPOT.
IT IS HAPPENING TO SOMEONE IN THIS PUBLIC POOL RIGHT NOW.
CAN YOU SPOT IT?
THERE SHE IS.
FORTUNATELY IF LIFEGUARDS SPONSOR IT MAKES THE RESCUE.
IT IS IN RESIDENTIAL POOLS WERE LIFEGUARDS ARE NOT USUALLY PRESENT THAT THE MAJORITY OF DRAWINGS TAKE PLACE.
SAFETY EXPERTS SAY THAT PART OF THE REASON IS DISTRACTED PARENTS.
TALKING ON THEIR PHONES GRILLING SOCIALIZING AND SUPERVISING OTHER CHILDREN WITH NO WATER WATCH.
A PERSON WITH EYES ON THE WATER AT ALL TIMES.E INVITED THIS GROUP OF PARENTS TO A POOL PARTY AND ASSIGNING THEM TASKS LIKE RUNNING THAT GRILL WITH OF COURSE TENDING TO THEIR OWN YOUNG KIDS.
WEVE ALSO ADDED SWIMMERS SPLASH IN THE PULPIT BUT THOSE SWIMMERS ARE ACTUALLY TRAINED LIFEGUARDS AND SOME INSTRUCTORS SKILLED IN MIMICKING A DROWNING.
THE PARENTS KNOW THEY ARE HERE TO LEARN ABOUT WATER SAFETY WITH SOME SORT OF DEMONSTRATION BEGINNING IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
BUT SINCE DROWNING OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT WILL BEGIN RIGHT NOW.
WITH CAMERAS ROLLING I WATCH FROM A GARAGE JUST NEXT TO THE PULPIT OBSERVING SOME PARENTS CHECK IN THE WATER BUT MOSTLY THEY ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR ASSIGNMENTS IN THE PARTY.
AFTER 30 MINUTES THERE WE GO.
SHE WENT UNDER.
OUR SWIM INSTRUCTOR SIMILES A DROWNING.
STRUGGLING TO KEEP HER HEAD ABOVE WATER.
ARMS CALLING FOR THE SURFACE.
JUST LIKE THE REAL THING SHE BARELY MAKES A SOUND.
MEANWHILE OUR GUESTS SEEM NOT TO NOTICE BIT MORE THAN A MINUTE GOES BY.
SHE IS STILL STRUGGLING AND NOBODY IS LOOKING.
WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT MORE THAN 2 AND A HALF MINUTES AND STILL NOBODY NOTICES A THING.
AFTER MORE THAN FOUR MINUTES SHE SALUTES A WORSTCASE SCENARIO AND STOPS MOVING.
SHE IS A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL AND IS JUST ACTING.
JOSH FROM THE AMERICAN RED CROSS HAS BEEN WATCHING WITH US.
FOREIGN HAVE MINUTES AND STILL NO PARENTS NOTICED ANYTHIN.
RIGHT.
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?
IT DOES NOT.
KELLY GOES BACK TO SWIMMING AND WE QUEUE ANOTHER SUMMER AND ANOTHER.ND ANOTHER.
ALL MIMICKING A JOURNEY BUT NOBODY STEPS IN.
YOU DO NOT REALIZE HOW COMPLETE THESE CUTTINGS AND GO FROM A FUN POOL PARTY TO AN INCIDENT WHERE SOMEONE NEEDS HELP. NOW THE KIDS ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE WATER AND THEY WILL GET SOME SNACKS AND THEY LEAVE SOMEONE BEHIND.
THAT PERSON IS GOING TO START TO DROWN.
AFTER 30 SECONDS A PURPOSEFUL STRUGGLE THAT IS THAT SPONSOR.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WITHIN 36 SECONDS HE NOTICED.
WE HOPE YOU WILL NOTICE FASTER.
IN SOME CASES SWIMMERS CAN SUBMERGE IN JUST A FEW SECONDS MAKING THEM HARD TO SPOT.
THERE WERE FOUR DROWNINGS THE NEW BASEBALL IT.
HOW TO MAKE YOU FEEL?
MAKERS FROM THE DECK SO TURN MY BACK WITH THAT DOES NOT MEAN OTHER KIDS ARE IN THE PULPIT.
I GOT THROWN OFF BY THEIR AGE BUT WE TOOK FOR GRANTED THAT THEY COULD ALL SWIM.
FOR THE MAN WHO SPOTTED THE VICTIM IT WAS SO CLOSE TO REALITY.
WHILE WE SO NERVOUS?
YOU WERE VISIBLY SHAKEN.
IT DID HAPPEN TO MY CHILD.
HIS DAUGHTER SURVIVED BUT WHEN SHE WAS JUST THREE SHE BEGAN DROWNING IN A HOT TUB.
SHEHE WAS ON THE PHONE.
I GOT A PHONE CALL AND A DISTRACTED AND SHE WAS IN TROUBLE.
THAT BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES.
ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IS A WATER WATER.
SOME WERE STANDING NEXT TO THE POOL FREE FROM DISTRACTIONS AND CONSTANTLY SCANNING THE WATER FOR ANY SIGNS OF DISTRESS.
ROTATING EVERY 15 MINUTES TO AVOID LOSING FOCUS.
WE SHOWED THE PARENTS WILL BE Lindsey INTO THE SPOTLIGHT ON EDUCATION WE ARE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENRICH STUDENTS AND KEEP THEM PLUGGED INTO LEARNING DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.

HOWEVER THIS COULD SHIFT A FEW MILES AND AROUND HERE THREE FOUR FIVE SIX MILES MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.
AS YOU MOVE INTO THE 700 AND 800 HOURS THINGS BEGIN TO IMPROVE FOR THE FIREWORKS.
FOURTH OF JULY AFTERNOON AND EVENING FORECAST LOOKS LIKE THIS BUT IT IS HOT IT IS HUMID AND TEMPERATURES WILL INTO THE UPPER 80S NEAR 90 TWO START.
