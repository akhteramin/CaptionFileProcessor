7WELCOME SPECIAL NIGHT AT ST. ANSELM COLLEGE IN MANCHESTER NEW HAMPSHIRE.
IM ANDERSON COOPER.
WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED WITH OUR CNN PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL EVENT.
IN THE LAST HOUR YOU HEARD FROM SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR.
LATER TONIGHT YOULL SEE CORY SANDERS KAMALA HARRIS AND PETE BUTTIGIEG.
TO PULL THIS EVENT OFF CNN HAS PARTNERED WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITYS COLLEGE OF POLITICS.
ALSO WITH THE NEW HAMPSHIRE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS RIGHT HERE AT ST. ANSELM COLLEGE.
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE CANDIDATES WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THESE YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE IN THE AUDITORIUM WHO SAY THEY PLAN TO VOTE IN THEIR STATES DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES.
WELCOME TO THE STAGE PLEASE SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.
HI.
ITS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HI.
HAVE A SEAT?
ARE WE GOING TO DO STUDENTS?
LETS GO RIGHT TO IT.
IN THAT CASE I WANT CLOSER.
HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE ONES IN THE BACK.
I WANT TO START WITH YOUR BIG ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY.
IT COULD IMPACT A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE.
I WANT TO BRING IN DENA MILLER FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
SHYS A JUNIOR STUDYING HISTORY.
DENA.
HI SENATOR.
I LIKE SO MANY OTHER STUDENTS HAD TO TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR MY EDUCATION THAT I WILL BE PAYING FOR YEARS.
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR STUDENT DEBT?
THANKS FOR THE QUESTION DENA.
THIS IS THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN NOW.
BASICALLY TO GET A SHOT AT A MIDDLE CLASS LIFE YOUVE GOT TO HAVE SOME POST HIGH SCHOOL TECHNICAL TRAINING TWOYEAR COLLEGE FOURYEAR COLLEGE MAYBE GRADUATE SCHOOL DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOURE ENDING UP DOING.
THE POSITION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN GOOD LUCK TO YOU YOURE ON YOUR OWN.
THE ONE THING THEYVE DONE THETHEY H HAVE DONE IS LENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO STUDENTS.
IT IS CRUSHING THEM.
MY PROPOSAL IS TO SAY THIS ISNT RIGHT.
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AS A COUNTRY IS ROLL BACK THAT DEBT.
SO I HAVE TWO PARTS TO THE PROPOSAL.
PART ONE IS THAT WE SAY THAT WERE GOING TO ROLL BACK STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR ABOUT 95 OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE DEBT.
THATS PART ONE.
AND PART TWO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEVER GET IN THIS MESS AGAIN ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THAT IS TO MAKE COLLEGE UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE WITH FREE TUITION AND FEES AND TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO PELL GRANTS SO THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR SO THAT OUR POOREST STUDENTS HAVE REAL ACCESS TO COLLEGE AND THAT WE PUT REAL MONEY INTO OUR UNIVERSITIES.BLACK COLLEGES AND THIS IS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE.
AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT?
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK FOR IT.
THAT IS THE CRITICISM FOR REPUBLICANS HOW TO PAY FOR IT.
CENTRIST DEMOCRATS SAY DOESNT THIS FEED THE NARRATIVE THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY FOR FREE.
LETS REMEMBER WHERE THIS ALL STARTED.
I STARTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ABOUT A WEALTH TAX.
ITS 2 CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR ABOVE THE GREAT FORTUNES ABOVE 50 MILLION DOLLARS.
SO YOUR 50 MILLIONTH AND FIRST DOLLAR YOU HAVE TO PAY TWO CENTS ON ALL OF THE DOLLARS AFTER THAT.
HERES THE STUNNING PART.
IF WE ASK THE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS COUNTRY UNDERSTAND THIS ISNT ABOUT TRYING TO BE NASTY OR SAY YOUVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG WHAT ITS ABOUT IS SAYING LOOK YOU HAD A GREAT IDEA.
YOU GOT OUT THERE.
YOU WORKED HARD OR YOU INHERITED WELL.
WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS.
 APPLAUSE  BUT NOW THAT YOUVE GOT THAT GREAT FORTUNE SPEND JUST A MINUTE TO REMEMBER HOW YOU GOT IT.
YOU BUILT THAT GREAT BUSINESS OR YOUR ANCESTORS DID USING WORKERS THAT ALL OF US HELPED PAY TO EDUCATE.
YOU GOT YOUR GOODS TO MARKET USING ROADS AND BRIDGES THAT ALL OF US HELPED PAY TO BUILD.
YOU ARE PROTECTED IN YOUR FACTORIES WITH FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS THAT ALL OF US HELPED TO PAY.
AND WE SAY GOOD FOR YOU THAT YOU HAVE NOW GOTTEN THIS GREAT FORTUNE BUT TWO CENTS.
YOUVE GOT TO PAY SOMETHING BACK SO EVERYBODY ELSE GETS A CHANCE.
AND HERES HOW THE MONEY WORKS OUT.
IF WE PUT THAT TWO CENT WEALTH TAX IN PLACE ON THE 75000 LARGEST FORTUNES IN THIS COUNTRY TWO CENTS WE CAN DO UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE FOR EVERY BABY ZERO TO 5 UNIVERSAL PREK UNIVERSAL COLLEGE AND KNOCK BACK THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN FOR 95 OF OUR STUDENTS AND STILL HAVE NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS LEFT OVER.
 APPLAUSE  YEAH.
I WANT YOU TO THI1  M MICK FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
HI MEGHAN.
SHES A GRADUATE STUDENT AT HARVARD AND M.I.T.
SHES A CONTRIBUTOR AT FORBES.
YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A SCHLUB.
I MEAN  WHAT DO YOU DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME MEGHAN?
ITS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
SO AMAZONS MONOPOLY MEANS I CAN BUY GENERIC GOODS AND BRANDS FROM MY PHONE AND RECEIVE THEM ON MY DOORSTEP WITHOUT A DELIVERY FEE WITHIN 24 HOURS.
HOW IS BREAKING UP BIG TECH GOOD FOR ME?
OKAY.
GOOD QUESTION MEGHAN.
HERES WHAT WE WANT TO REMEMBER ABOUT AMAZON ABOUT GOOGLE ABOUT APPLE ABOUT A LOT OF THESE GIANT TECH COMPANIES.
THEY ACTUALLY RUN TWO BUSINESSES.
SO ONE IS THE PLATFORM.
THATS THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE COME TO BUY AND SELL GOODS.
THATS WHERE YOU GO TO GET WHATEVER IT IS YOU KNOW YOU CAN COMPARE 48 PRINTERS AND GET IT ALL DELIVERED IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.
GOT IT.
COOL.
THATS THE PLATFORM.
JUST SO YOU GET AN IDEA OF THE SCALE HERE FOR AMAZON WALMART DOES ABOUT 9 OF ALL RETAIL SALES IN AMERICA.
IF YOU WANT TO SELL ONLINE AMAZON IS DOING ABOUT 49 OF ALL RETAIL SALES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN AMERICA.
SO THAT IS THE MARKETPLACE.
SO AMAZON RUNS THE MARKETPLACE.
IM COOL WITH THAT.
IM ALL FOR A MARKETPLACE BUT AMAZON DOES A SECOND THING AND THAT IS THEY COLLECT INFORMATION ON EVERY BUYER AND SELLER WHO COMES THROUGH.
EVERY TIME YOU GO TO BUY SOMETHING THEY GET YOUR INFORMATION AND THEY AGGREGATE IT WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION THEY HAD ABOUT YOU.
EVERY TIME YOU COME TO SELL SOMETHING THEY GET INFORMATION.
AND THEN THEY SEE THAT WHOA OVER THERE IT LOOKS LIKE PET PILLOWS IS STARTING TO MAKE A BIG PROFIT.
HUH SAYS AMAZON.
I KNOW WHAT WELL DO.
LETS JUMP IN FRONT OF PET PILLOWS AND DO AMAZON PET MOVE PET PILLOWS FROM THE FRONT PAGE BACK TO PAGE 16 AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT AMAZON BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIOR INFORMATION CAN COME IN AND KNOCK OUT ALL OF THE COMPETITION.
NOW THIS IS A REAL THING MEGHAN THATS HAPPENING.
HERES WHAT WE KNOW AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THAT THE AREA AROUND THESE GIANTS ARE REFERRED TO BY VENTURE CAPITALISTS INVESTORS AS THE DEAD ZONE BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU TRY TO START UP A BUSINESS YOU JUST RUN THE RISK THAT AMAZON STEPS IN FRONT OF YOU OR GOOGLE THEY BUY YOU OUT BEFORE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO GET STARTED.
LOOK HERES HOW I SEE IT.
YOU CAN RUN THE PLATFORM THAT IS YOU CAN BE THE UMPIRE IN THE BASEBALL GAME AND YOU CAN RUN AN HONEST PLATFORM OR YOU CAN BE A PLAYER THAT IS YOU CAN HAVE A BUSINESS OR YOU CAN HAVE A TEAM IN THE GAME BUT YOU DONT GET TO BE THE UMPIRE AND HAVE A TEAM IN THE GAME.
IF WE BREAK OFF THE PLATFORM FROM THE PARTS THAT ARE COMPETING WHAT YOULL SEE IN AMERICA IS A PLATFORM THAT WORKS REALLY WELL.
ITS A VERY PROFITABLE BUSINESS BUT YOULL SEE A LOT MORE COMPETITION WHERE LITTLE BUSINESSES HAVE A CHANCE TO GET GOING WHERE WHEN YOUVE GOT A GOOD IDEA YOU CAN BUILD THAT INTO SOMETHING WHERE THERES REALLY A CHANCE FOR EVERYBODY TO GET IN AND COMPETE.
SO THATS THE REASON I WANT TO SEE THE TWO OF THEM BROKEN APART.
DO YOU ORDER STUFF FROM AMAZON?
SURE.
YOU DO?
WHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU ORDERED DO YOU KNOW?
A MAILBOX.
OKAY.
WHAT DID THEY PUT THE MAILBOX IN WHEN THEY DELIVER IT?
IT COMES IN A BOX.
IT WAS A BOX OF MAILBOX.
WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION NOW.
OKAY.
THIS IS SETH PHILO FROM ARIZONA.
HES A SUPPORTER OF BUTTIGIEG.
IN 2012 YOU OPPOSED THE SALE OF MARIJUANA YET IN 2016 YOU CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA NATIONWIDE.
WHAT ARE YOUR HONEST VIEWS ON THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA AND MARIJUANA LEGISLATION AND IF THEY HAVE WHY HAVE THEY CHANGED?
SO ACTUALLY I SUPPORTED MASSACHUSETTS CHANGING ITS LAWS ON MARIJUANA.
MASSACHUSETTS HAD DECRIMINALIZED AT THAT POINT AND I THOUGHT IT MADE A LOT MORE SENSE FOR MASSACHUSETTS TO GO AHEAD AND LEGALIZE MARIJUANA AND I NOW SUPPORT THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA.
AND LET ME TELL YOU AT LEAST A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY.
THE FIRST ONE IS ITS JUST A PLAIN OLD SCIENCE REASON.
IT MAKES NO DARN SENSE THAT RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE TREAT MARIJUANA AS A SCHEDULE 1 DRUG WHICH MEANS IN EFFECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED IN ADVANCE THAT IT HAS NO MEDICINAL USE THAT IT CANT HAVE ANY GOOD EFFECTS NO RESEARCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.
IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DO RESEARCH ON IT AND THATS JUST WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS RIGHT?
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO IT.
BUT THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL IMPACT OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF MARIJUANA LAWS.
YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY THE BEST EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT AFRICANAMERICANS AND WHITES USE MARIJUANA AT ABOUT THE SAME RATES AND YET AFRICANAMERICANS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA USE THAN WHITES ARE.
SO EVERY TIME WE START TO TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM FOR EXAMPLE I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO START IS WITH THE THINGS WE MAKE ILLEGAL AND ONE OF THE BEST PLACES WE COULD START IS BY LEGALIZING MARIJUANA.
I WANT YOU TO MEET JACKSON DWYER HES FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
HES A SENIOR AT ST. ANSELM COLLEGE.
HI JACKSON.
HI SENATOR.
YOU HAVE OFTEN BEEN A VOCAL CRITIC OF STATE POLICERS.
HOW CAN YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT KEEPS LAW ENFORCEMENT SAFE?
SO THATS A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
I APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING IT.
YOU KNOW I TALK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PEOPLE WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED VARIOUS PARTS OF IT AND WHAT ALL OF THEM TELL ME IS WEVE GOT A PROBLEM.
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THAT PROBLEM IS RACE.
AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS HEAD ON.
SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHATS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS US THAT AFRICANAMERICANS COMPARED WITH WHITES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOR EXACTLY THE SAME CRIMES THEYRE MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED THEYRE MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRAIGNED THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TAKEN TO TRIAL.
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARSHER SENTENCES.
THIS IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ONLY LOCKING UP TOO MANY PEOPLE IT IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT HAS A PROBLEM OF RACE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF IT AND WE NEED TO CALL IT OUT FOR WHAT IT IS.
 APPLAUSE  NO ONE IS SAFER IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE A BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO LET ME JUST GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF THE PARTS DIRECTLY TO YOUR QUESTION.
I SAID ON THE FIRST PART ONE WAY WE CAN HELP FIX THIS SYSTEM IS TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IT IS WE MAKE IT ILLEGAL.
HOW ABOUT THE NEXT PART IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM?
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED AND GETS GOOD LEGAL REPRESENTATION.
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED AND NOT THE WRONG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY COULDNT AFFORD TO HIRE A LAWYER.
JUSTICE IS NOT JUST FOR THOSE WHO ARE RICH JUSTICE IS FOR EVERYONE AND THE ONLY WAY WERE ABLE TO GET THAT IN AMERICA IS IF WERE ABLE TO PUT THE RESOURCES INTO IT.
THIRD PART OFHIS IROFIT PRIVAT PRISONS.
IT IS AN OUTRAGE IN AMERICA.
 APPLAUSE  SFFOURTH IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE PRISON SYSTEM THEY NEED TO BE REINTEGRATED.
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND A JOB FIND DECENT HOUSING AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS.
AND THAT MEANS THEY NEED THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO BE REINSTATED.
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS.
ONE MORE YOU TALK ABOUT SAFETY FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND YOU ARE RIGHT.
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.
ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS THAT WE COULD HELP MAKE OUR POLICE SAFER IS TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT GUN SAFETY IN THIS COUNTRY.
 APPLAUSE  YOU MENTIONED SARGEANT GANNONS TRAGIC DEATH IN MASSACHUSETTS.
I WROTE AN OP ED WITH HIS PARENTS ABOUT ASKING FOR OUR LEADERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TO STEP UP AND PASS SOME SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
WE NEED UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WE NEED TO TAKE WEAPONS OF WAR OFF OUR CITY STREETS.
RIGHT NOW WE LIVE IN AMERICA WHERE 7 CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS WILL DIE EVERY SINGLE DAY WHERE THE LIVES OF OFFICERS ARE PUT AT RISK.
WE NEED AS A COUNTRY TO STEP UP TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE TO BE WILLING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE NRA AND TO PUT SOME SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN PLACE.
I THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST THAT WE CAN DO.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.
 APPLAUSE  THIS IS ELLIE TAYLOR.
SHES FROM WISCONSIN.
SHES A STUDENT AT HARVARD AND A FRESHMAN.
HI ELLIE.
HI SENATOR.
THIS ISNT AS MUCH OF A POLICYBASED QUESTION.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE VOICED YOU GETTING HILLARIED IN THE ELECTION SO WHAT LESSONS HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM 2016 THAT WILL HELP YOU TO KIND OF NAVIGATE THESE SITUATIONS WHEN YOU MIGHT BE CRITICIZED FOR SOMETHING THATS PARTIALLY MOTIVATED BY SEXIST.
THATS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION BUT IF I CAN I WANT TO GO BACK BEFORE 2016.
CAN WE ALL JUST LET OUR HAIR DOWN HERE FOR A MINUTE?
THIS DIDNT JUST START IN 2016.
BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.
ILL TELL YOU WHEN I RAN INTO IT BIG TIME.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE IN ELECTED POLITICS.
IVE KNOWN WHAT I WANTED TO DO ALL MY LIFE.
I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER.
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE MY JOB FOREVER.
DURING THE CRASH I END UP DOWN IN WASHINGTON SETTING UP A CONSUMER AGENCY FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.
AFTER I DID THAT FOR A YEAR THE REPUBLICANS SAID WERE NEVER GOING TO LET HER STAY AND RUN THAT THING.
I CAME BACK TO MASSACHUSETTS.
THERE WAS A VERY POPULAR REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT.
HE HAD HIGH APPROVAL RATINGS HE HAD A BUCKET OF MONEY IN THE BANK FROM WALL STREET AND HE HAD JUST BEATEN A WOMAN WHO WAS REALLY GOOD AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT WAS GOING TO WIN.
SO I START GETTING THESE PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE AND THEY SAY ELIZABETH YOU SHOULD RUN AGAINST HIM FOR THE SENATE SEAT.
YOU SHOULD DO IT.
GO AHEAD.
YOU SHOULD DO THIS THING.
YOURE GOING TO LOSE BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THESE WERE DEMOCRATS CALLING ME.
SAYING YOU SHOULD DO THIS.
YOURE GOING TO LOSE.
ALL I CAN SAY IS DEMOCRATS GET A BETTER MESSAGE.
BUT PEOPLE SAID TO ME YOURE GOING TO LOSE BECAUSE MASSACHUSETTS IN 2011 ACCORDING TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WAS NOT READY TO HAVE A WOMAN SENATOR OR GOVERNOR.
WE NEVER HAD AND PEOPLE SAID ITS JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN  GENERATION.
NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW I HEARD THAT.
I HEARD THAT AS GET IN THIS RACE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS WHAT I DID.
SO I JUMPED IN THE RACE AND SURE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THE EARLY COVERAGE IS ABOUT WHAT IM WEARING.
ITS ABOUT MY HAIR.
VOICE.
WHETHER OR NOT I SMILE ENOUGH.
I DIDNT.
IT WAS EVERY PART OF THAT.
THIS KEPT UP AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW LOOK IM GOING TO BE IN THIS RACE.
IM GOING TO MAKE SOMETHING COUNT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
SO EVERY DAY WHEN I SAW A LITTLE GIRL I WOULD COME UP AND ID USUALLY GET DOWN IM A TEACHER AND I WOULD SAY HI MY NAME IS ELIZABETH AND IM RUNNING FOR SENATE BECAUSE THATS WHAT GIRLS DO.
 APPLAUSE  AND THEN WE WOULD PINKY SWEAR TO REMEMBER AND SO EVERY NIGHT WHEN I WENT HOME NO MATTER WHAT THE DAY HAD BEEN LIKE I WOULD COUNT UP HOW MANY PINKY SWEARS WE HAD DONE DURING THE DAY.
AND I KEPT GETTING OUT THERE AND HAMMERING MY MESSAGE.
I KEPT GETTING OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT WHATS HAPPENING WITH WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TALKING ABOUT HOW WASHINGTON WORKS GREAT FOR THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL JUST NOT WORKING FOR ANYONE ELSE AND HOW WEVE GOT TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THAT.
SO I TALKED ABOUT IT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND ULTIMATELY I WENT FROM 17 POINTS BEHIND THAT GUY TO BEATING HIM BY 7 12.
SO THE WAY I SEE IT IS HERE WE ARE IN A PRESIDENTIAL AND ITS THE SAME KIND OF YOU STAY AFTER IT EVERY DAY.
ONE SAY YOU PERSIST.
 SE  ORGANIZE BUILD A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT FIGHT FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND THATS HOW IM GOING TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 APPLAUSE  WERE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
WELL BE BACK MORE WITH THE CNN PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL.

WERE LIVE IN MANCHESTER NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR A SPECIAL CNN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL EVENT.
FIVE TOWN HALL EVENTS TONIGHT.
ALL OF THEM TAKING QUESTIONS FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS.
RIGHT NOW IT IS SENATOR ELIZABETH WARRENS TURN.
I DO WANT TO ASK YOU YOU HAVE CALLED FOR IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS TO BE INITIATED AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE DEMOCRATS THAT SAY THIS IS NOT THE TIME.
IT WILL TAKE AWAY THE FOCUS FROM THE ELECTION IN 2020.
SPEAKER PELOSI SAID SHE DIDNT HAVE A PLAN TO DO IT.
THERE IS NO POLITICAL CONVENIENCE TIME EXCEPTION TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
THIS ONE IS IF I CAN I WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
LAST THURSDAY I HAD BEEN OUT  TO SOUTH CAROLINA.
THIS WAS ALL ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.
THATS WHERE I WAS SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COMMUNITIES PROTESTING OFF SHORE DRILLING.
I THEN CAME TO COLORADO THE BIGGEST DROUGHT IN 1200 YEARS.
AND THEN TO UTAH WHERE THEY HAD ONE OF THE WORST WILDFIRE SEASONS IN A GENERATION.
IM ON AN AIRPLANE AND THE MUELLER REPORT DROPS AND I START READING IT ON THROUGH THE EVENING I READ IT INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING AND WHEN I GET TO THE END THREE THINGS JUST JUMP OFF THE PAGE.
I DONT CARE IF YOURE A DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT LIBERTARIAN VEGETARIAN THREE THINGS JUST TOTALLY JUMP OFF THE PAGE.
THE FIRST IS THAT A HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ATTACKED OUR 2016 ELECTION IN ORDER TO HELP DONALD TRUMP.
THE EVIDENCE IS JUST THERE.
READ IT FOOTNOTE AFTER FOOTNOTE PAGE AFTER PAGE DOCUMENTATION.
PART TWO DONALD TRUMP WELCOMED THAT HELP.
SO ON THE FIRST ONE ABOUT WHAT THEY DID UNDERSTAND THIS WAS A SOPHISTICATED ATTACK.
THEY ATTACKED PART OF VOTING SYSTEM.
THATS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING FEDERAL SYSTEM.
THEY HACKED INTO MORE THAN 50 COMPUTERS AT THE DNC THE DCCC.
AYE VERY SERIOUS ATTACK.
AND DONALD TRUMP WELCOMING IT.
IN THE MUELLER REPORT JUST READ IT.
HE GETS OFF THE PHONE FROM AN UNNAMED CALLER AND LOOKS UP AND SAYS TO THE OTHER PERSON ON THE PHONE THERE ARE MORE LEAKS COMING.
THE IDEA THAT HE WAS WELCOMING WHAT WAS HAPPENING FROM THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND BY THE SUMMER OF 2016 THE REPORT DOCUMENTS THAT BY THAT POINT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY HAD A WORKED OUT FORMAL PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH THE LEAKS THAT WERE COMING IN FROM THE RUSSIANS.
SO THATS PART TWO.
PART THREE IS WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STARTS TO INVESTIGATE PART ONE AND PART TWO DONALD TRUMP TOOK REPEATED STEPS AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO HALT THE INVESTIGATION DERAIL THE INVESTIGATION PUSH THE INVESTIGATION SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT OTHERWISE KEEP THAT INVESTIGATION FROM GOING FORWARD AND TURNING INTO A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION ABOUT A HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT IT ATTACKED US AND ABOUT HIS OWN PERSONAL INTERESTS.
SO HERES HOW I SEE THIS.
IF ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING IN THIS COUNTRY HAD DONE WHATS DOCUMENTED IN THE MUELLER REPORT THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL.
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS A SERIOUS CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY BUT MUELLER BELIEVED BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTIONS FROM DONALD TRUMPS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT HE COULD NOT BRING A CRIMINAL INDICTMENT AGAINST A SITTING PRESIDENT.
I THINK HES WRONG ON THAT BUT THATS WHAT HE BELIEVED.
SO HE SERVES THE WHOLE THING UP TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND SAYS IN EFFECT IF THERES GOING TO BE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ACCOUNTABILITY HAS TO COME FROM THE CONGRESS.
AND THE TOOL T WE ARE GIVEN FOR THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS THIS IS ABOUT PRINCIPLE.
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF A DEMOCRACY WE HAVE.
IN A DICTATORSHIP EVERYTHING IN GOVERNMENT REVOLVES AROUND PROTECTING THE ONE PERSON AT THE CENTER BUT NOT UNDER OUR DEMOCRACY AND NOT UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION.
WE HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES AND TO PROCEED HERE IN A WAY UNDERSTANDING OUR PLACE IN HISTORY THAT NOT ONLY PROTECTS DEMOCRACY NOW BUT PROTECTS DEMOCRACY WHEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT COMES IN AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT AFTER THAT.
BUT YOU  THATS OUR RESPONSIBILITY.
BUT YOU STARTED OFF BY SAYING BY TALKING ABOUT SOME OF YOUR TRAVELS AND PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THEIR CONCERNS TABLETOP ISSUES.
YES.
DOESNT PUTTING A LOT OF PEOPLES FOCUS ON IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT IT WONT GO ANYWHERE IN THAT SENSE DOESNT THAT TAKE AWAY FOCUS FROM THE TABLETOP ISSUES THAT YOU AND OTHER DEMOCRATS SAY YOU WANT TO RUN ON?
IF YOUVE ACTUALLY READ THE MUELLER REPORT ITS ALL LAID OUT THERE.
ITS NOT LIKE ITS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
ITS THERE.
ITS GOT THE FOOTNOTES ITS GOT THE POINTS IT CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO THE LAW.
BUT THIS REALLY IS FUNDAMENTALLY I TOOK AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE SENATE AND HOUSE AND I BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OUGHT TO HAVE TO VOTE AND TO SAY EITHER YEAH THATS OKAY WITH ME.
YEAH LET A PRESIDENT JUST STEP IN THE WAY HE DID WHEN HE TOLD THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO GO FIRE MUELLER AND THEN TOLD THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO GO LIE ABOUT HAVING TOLD THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO GO FIRE MUELLER AND THEN TOLD THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO WRITE A LETTER SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT TOLD HIM TO GO FIRE MUELLER AND THEN TO SAY WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU TAKE NOTES ABOUT WHAT I SAID TO YOU?
THE LAWYERS I DEAL WITH NEVER PUT ANYTHING IN WRITING.
IF THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE WHO WANT TO SAY THATS WHAT A PRESIDENT CAN DO WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR HIS OWN WRONGDOINGS OR WHEN A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ATTACKS OUR COUNTRY THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT VOTE AND LIVE WITH IT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
 APPLAUSE  I WANT YOU TO MEET THIS IS CECELIA DARMS.
SHES A SOPHOMORE AT HARVARD.
SHE INTERNT FOR HILLARY CLINTONS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
HI.
YOU ARE REGISTERED AS A REPUBLICAN IN 1995.
I WAS.
BUT YOUVE SINCE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS.
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR BELIEVES OR DO YOU BELIEVE THE POLITICAL PARTIES CHANGED AROUND YOU?CECE.
I GREW UP IN A FAMILY THAT WASNT POLITICAL.
I GREW UP OUT IN OKLAHOMA AND TO THIS DAY I COULDNT TELL YOU HOW MY PARENTS WERE REGISTERED OR MY GRANDPARENTS OR MUCH OF ANYBODY ELSE.
MY MOM ALWAYS VOTED.
I KNOW THAT AND IN FACT SHE WORKED AT THE POLLS SOMETIMES BUT WE WERENT A POLITICAL FAMILY.
AND WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MOM AND STRUGGLING TO TRY TO KEEP UP WITH MY JOB AND GET DINNER ON THE TABLE AND TAKE CARE OF A COUPLE OF LITTLE KIDS AND LAUNCH MY CAREER I DIDNT THINK MUCH ABOUT POLITICS.
NOW IVE BEEN A POLICY PERSON FOR A LONG LONG TIME SO I THINK THE QUESTION YOURE ASKING ME IS WHEN DOES THE CHANGE COME?
AND THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
SO IN LATE HID 1990s I HAD BEEN WORKING OVER AND OVER AND OVER ON WHATS HAPPENING TO AMERICAS WORKING FAMILIES TO AMERICAS MIDDLE CLASS HOW IT IS THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD WHO PLAY BY THE RULES ARE JUST FINDING A PATH STEEPER AND ROCKIER YEAR BY YEAR AND FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR EVEN STEEPER AND EVEN ROCKIER.
THIS IS MY LIFES WORK.
SO I KEEP WORKING ON THIS ABOUT WHATS CHANGING IN AMERICA?
IM STUDYING FAMILIES THAT GO BANKRUPT AND THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES HALF DOZEN GIANT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FIGURE OUT THAT IF THEY CAN GET THE BANKRUPTCY LAWS CHANGED THAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE BY JUST A LITTLE BY KEEPING PEOPLE LOCKED OUT OF BANKRUPTCY.
NEVER MIND THAT THERES PEOPLE THAT ARE HEAD OVER HEELS IN MEDICAL DEBTS THAT THEYVE HAD JOB LOSSES OR A DEATH OR IN THE FAMILY BUT THEYVE BEEN CHEATED BY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES AND MORTGAGE COMPANIES.
NEVER MIND ANY OF THAT.
I LOOKED AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THAT FIGHT AND I REALIZED ALL THE MONEY WAS ON ONE SIDE AND ALL THE HURTING WAS ON THE OTHER AND THATS WHEN I JUMPED IN POLITICALLY.
I GOT IN THAT FIGHT AND I FOUGHT IT FOR TEN YEARS AND BY THE END OF THAT FIGHT I FULLY UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN STOOD THERE FOR THE BANKS AND HALF OF THE DEMOCRATS DID.
SO MY PARTY WAS THE PARTY THAT AT LEAST WE GOT HALF OF THEM TO STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND THAT WAS THE BIG CHANGE FOR ME.
 APPLAUSE  I WANT YOU TO MEET THIS IS ERIC JEMBA A SOPHOMORE FROM HARVARD.
YOU CAN TELL FROM HIS SWEATSHIRT.
GREAT SWEATSHIRT.
A FORMER INTERN FOR CORY BOOKER.
HES CURRENTLY UNDECIDED WHO TO SUPPORT.
HI.
ENTITLEMENTS THOUGH NOT THE SEXIEST ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSING.
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO REFORM OUR PRESENT SOCIAL SECURITY TO INCREASE ITS LONG GEFT?
IM REALLY GLAD YOU ASKED ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE THIS IS ONE THAT REMINDS YOU HOW THINGS HAVE BROKEN APART IN THIS COUNTRY.
AS YOU ALTHOUGH SOCIAL SECURITY PASSED BACK DURING THE GREAT DEPR DEPRESSION.
IT WAS TOO NARROW AND CUT OUT TOO MANY PARTICULARLY JOBS UP THERE TO BE HELD BUT SOCIAL SECURITY BECAME A MAINSTAY.
AND FROM THE 1930s UNTIL THE LATE 1980s WE UNDERSTOOD THAT SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN SET ONCE AND GO.
GOING BACK TO WORK CHANGES HOW MANY PEOPLE GET SICK RIGHT?
AND SO EVERY FEW YEARS FOR A VERY LONG TIME WE KEPT MAKING LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS AND THAT WAY SOCIAL SECURITY STAYED ON A TRACK TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WOULD BE THERE FOR YOUR GENERATION AND THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE NEXT GENERATION AFTER THAT.
IN THE LATE 1980s THE REPUBLICANS JUST SAID NO THAT WERE NOT GOING TO MAKE ANYMORE CHANGES.
NOT GOING TO KEEP THE CHANGES.
THE CONSEQUENCE IS EVERY TIME WE GET IT DOWN ITS A LITTLE FURTHER OUT OF WHACK.
THE GOOD NEWS IS WEVE GOT ROUGHLY I HAVENT CHECKED THE NUMBERS.
ABOUT 20 MORE YEARS WHERE WE ARE IF WE DO NOTHING.
WHEN IT DROPS IT WOULD DROP BY ROUGHLY 25 AND THEN LEVEL OUT AND BE THERE.
SO ITS NOT THAT IT WILL DISAPPEAR FOR YOUR GENERATION.
HERES THE DEAL.
THIS IS ONE MORE OF THOSE PROBLEMS A LITTLE LIKE CLIMATE THE SOONER YOU FIX IT THE EASIER IT IS TO FIX.
NOW ITS ALREADY HARD ON THIS FRONT BUT ITS ONE OF THESE THINGS WE NEED TO FIX NOW.
BUT THE PROBLEM WEVE GOT NOT THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS  WELL NOT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE MATH.
THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE MATH.
THE PROBLEM IS THE POLITICAL WILL AND THE WILLINGNESS TO STEP UP AND SAY WEVE GOT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.
WE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BEND THE CURVES THEYRE CALLED SO THAT PARTICULARLY WOMEN WHO HAD LOWER EARNINGS FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT THEY WERE WORKING GET BETTER SUPPORT IN THEIR LATER YEARS BUT AT THIS MOMENT THERES NO POLITICAL WILL TO COME TOGETHER.
THERES NO ONE WILLING TO DRIVE THIS.
WHY?
BECAUSE WASHINGTON KEEPS WORKING FOR THOSE AT THE TOP.
ITS NOT WORKING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RELYING ON SOCIAL SECURITY.
YOUR QUESTION WAS IS THIS SOMETHING THE PLAN IS NOT HARD.
ITS POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
IM WILLING TO TAKE ON THAT FIGHT.
ITS AN IMPORTANT FIGHT.
SO THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MATT SPRANT.
HE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM COLLEGE TO WORK AS A FULLTIME STAFFER FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.
HI MAX.
SENATOR WARREN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
THANK YOU.
MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE POLITICS OF THIS RACE.
IN PARTICULAR I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESIDENT TRUMPS NAMECALLING AND BULLYING FIRSTHAND AND GIVEN THE SUCCESS THAT HES HAD WITH THESE TACTICS IN THE PAST I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU WOULD PROPOSE TO COUNTER THEM IF YOU WERE TO BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE.
IN PARTICULAR ARE YOU AFRAID HE CAN CARICATURE YOU?
SO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
YOU KNOW IVE BEEN AROUND THIS BLOCK BEFORE.
BACK IN 2012 WHEN I RAN AGAINST THAT VERY POPULAR REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT.
HE RAN THE SAME PLAY AND WHAT I DISCOVERED AT THAT POINT IS AROUND THE COMMONWEALTH PEOPLE CARE A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES THAN THEY DO ABOUT SOME KIND OF NAMECALLING.
I GOT IN THE RACE IN 12 AND I THIS RACE RIGHT NOW AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NOT BECAUSE I LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MER ROHR EVERY DAY.
OH SENATOR PRESIDENT?
IT WASNT THAT AT ALL.
ITS MY LIFES WORK.
I GREW UP IN A FAMILY THAT WAS PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.
I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS WHO HAD A DREAM.
WE TALKED ABOUT COLLEGE.
IVE KNOWN WHAT IVE WANDED TO DO SINCE SECOND GRADE.
HAVE WE HEARD FROM ERICAS PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS?
COME ON GUYS.
 APPLAUSE  I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN MY FAMILY.
BY THE TIME I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL THERE WAS NO MONEY EVEN FOR COLLEGE APPLICATION MUCH LESS TO SEND ME OFF TO FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE.
I HAVE A TWISTED STORY.
LIKE SOME AMERICANS DO.
WERE NOT ALL ON A STATE LINE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS I WON A SCHOLARSHIP YEAH.
AND THEN AT 19 I FELL IN LOVE.
YEAH.
AND THEN I GOT MARRIED.
YEAH.
THEN I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL YEAH.
AND I TOOK A JOB ANSWERING PHONES AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY LIFE FOREVER.
A GOOD LIFE BUT NOT THE DREAM I HAD.
AND THEN I FOUND A COMMUTER COLLEGE THAT COST 50 A SEMESTER AND FOR A PRICE THAT I COULD PAY FOR ON A PARTTIME WAITRESSING JOB I HAD A CHANCE TO GET A FOUR YEAR DIPLOMA AND BECOME A SPECIAL NEEDS TEACHER.
I HAD LIVED MY DREAM.
AND THATS WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE BEST OF AMERICA WHEN WE OPEN MORE DOORS FOR MORE PEOPLE.
I WANT TO LIVE IN AN AMERICA THATS NOT JUST ABOUT BORN OPPORTUNITY BUT THATS FOR OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US.
JUST THOSE FEW PIECES I PUT TOMPGT A 2 CENT WEALTH TAX WOULD LET US DO UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE WOULD LET US DO UNIVERSAL PREK NOT BACK THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN AND STILL HAVE MONEY TO SEND.
I THINK THIS IS THE PACE WEVE GOT TO MAKE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.
WERE NOT GOING TO WIN BY SAYING NOT DONALD TRUMP.
WERE NOT GOING TO WIN BY DOING BETTER NAMECALLING THAN HE DOES.
THE WAY WERE GOING TO DO THIS GET OUT AND TALK ABOUT OUR VISION AND HOW IT AFFECTS FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WERE GOING TO INVITE PEOPLE NOT JUST TO VOTE BUT TO COME OFF THE SIDELINES AND BE PART OF THIS.
TO GET ENGAGED.
TO VOLUNTEER TO KICK IN FIVE BUCKS TO GO TO EE LIT BEZ W WARREN.
WHATS AT STAKE IS NOT ONLY OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE IT IS ALSO OUR DEMOCRACY.
IM IN THIS FIGHT ALL THE WAY.
I THINK WE MAKE THAT CASE AND I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE WITH US.
WELL HAVE MORE.
STAY WITH US.

l WELCOME BACK.
WERE LIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR A SPECIAL CNN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL.
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
I WANT TO OUR NEXT QUESTION IS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.
GOOD.
YOU TALKED ABOUT IT BRIEFLY.
ITS DRASTICALLY GROWN IN A POLL TODAY.
THIS IS TYELER PIERCE.
HES STUDYING BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE WHICH IM INTO THE EVEN SURE WHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE IM DUMB.
HE WORKED AS A FELLOW FOR THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MID TERMS.
HI SENATOR HOW ARE YOU?
IM GOOD.
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE?
TYLER IT IS THE EXISTENTIAL QUESTION RIGHT NOW.
AS I SAID I WAS JUST OUT IN THREE DIFFERENT STATES FACING CLIMATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ALL OF THEM POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING.
I HAVE AN 8YEAROLD GRANDSON AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN HES WILL IT BE A PLACE WHERE THE MIDWEST HAS BURNED UP?
WHERE WE HAVE LOST OUR GREAT FORESTS?
WILL IT BE A PLACE WHERE LARGE PARTS OF THE OCEANS ARE DEAD?
WILL IT BE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE JUST FIGHTING FOR CLEAN WATER?
WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO MAKE A CHANGE.
WE MUST MAKE CHANGE AND WE MUST MAKE IT NOW.
SO HERES HOW I SEE THIS.
I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF GREEN NEW DEAL.
 APPLAUSE  I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY.
THERES TWO PRINCIPLE REASONS FOR THAT.
THE FIRST REASON THAT IM A STRONG SUPPORTER IS ITS A WAY FOR URGENCY.
WE CANNOT WAIT LONGER.
WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE.
THATS HOW I HEAR THIS.
THE SECOND PART ABOUT THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS THAT IT CALLS FOR A HUGE INVESTMENT IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK THATS JUST ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.
AND WHEN I SAY OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ITS ABOUT OUR POWER INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO ABOUT HARDENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN WITH STAND THE STORM AND MOVE TO POWER.
LOTS OF PIECES THAT WE NEED TO DO BUT I ALSO SEE THIS AS A TIME WHEN ITS ALL HANDS ON DECK.
THAT IS WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHINA LET ME JUST DO A COUPLE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN DO ALL BY HERSELF.
I JUST PUT OUT A PLAN ON FIRST DAY OF MY ADMINISTRATION I WILL PUT IN PLACE A MORITORIUM.
NO NEW DRILLING NO NEW MINING ON FEDERAL LANDS PERIOD.
 APPLAUSE  WE SHOULD NOT BE SELLING OUT FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR TO MINING COMPANIES AND TO OIL COMPANIES OUR NATIONAL TREASURES.
ILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE OF THIS AND THAT IS 10000 JOBS.
FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SPEND A YEAR IN THE NATIONAL PARKS AND NATIONAL FORESTS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THE LAND AND MAKE REPAIRS.
THIS IS A PART OF WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER.
HOW ABOUT A COUPLE OF MORE PIECES?
THE UNITED STATES IS A WORLD LEADER ON CLIMATE.
WE ARE.
WERE JUST LEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION NOW.
THATS DANGEROUS BECAUSE ITS NOT ONLY WHAT WERE DOING WRONG BUT WERE GIVING COVER TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.
FOR EVERYBODY THAT DOESNT WANT TO TAKE THE TOUGH STEPS AND DOESNT WANT TO MAKE CHANGES.
WERE GIVING THEM COVER.
WE BECOME A WORLD LEADER IN THE DIRECTION OF A SUSTAINABLE EARTH.
CAN I THROW IN ONE MORE?
THATS NO COAL LOBBISTS ARE HEAD OF THE EPA.
ONE MORE QUESTION FROM THE AUDIENCE.
HI NICHOLAS.
AS A DEMOCRAT THAT HAS A LOT OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT THINKS LIKE EVERY PRESIDENT HE HAD HIS SHORTCOMINGS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD APPROACH YOUR JOB AS PRESIDENT AND THE WAY PRESIDENT OBAMA APPROACHED HIS JOB?
IM GOING TO TAKE IT IN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DIRECTION IF I CAN.
NO NO IM GOING TO GET HERE.
SO I SPENT AS I TOLD ALL OF YOU REALLY MY WHOLE LIFES WORK INTO WHATS HAPPENING WITH WORKING FAMILIES.
STARTING IN THE EARLY 2000S THE CRISIS WAS COMING.
I WAS WAVING MY ARM RINGING THE BELL DOING EVERYTHING I COULD.
I SAID FAMILIES ARE GETTING CHEATED ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.
IT START WHEN THE MORTGAGE COMPANIES TARGETED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.
THEY TARGETED SENIORS.
LATINOS.
THEY CAME IN AND TARGETED THE WORST OUT OF THE COMMUNITIES AND TALKED ABOUT IT TO ANYONE THAT WOULD LISTEN A CRISIS IS COMING.
IF YOUR EARS ARE STUFFED WITH MONEY ITS HARD TO HEAR.
SO THE CRISIS HIT IN 20072008 AND JUST TOOK US DOWN.
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO GOING FORWARD?
A LOT OF FOLKS WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS JUST TAKE CARE OF THE BIG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO WORKING FAMILIES AGAIN.
SO THE IDEA I HAD CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU I SAID IM GOING TO GET IN THIS FIGHT.
IM A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.
I HAVE NO POLITICAL SWAY BUT IM GOING TO GET IN THIS FIGHT AND FIGHT FOR IT.
PEOPLE TOLD ME TWO THINGS.
GREAT IDEA.
DONT EVEN TRY.
THE REASON NOT TO TRY IS THERES NO WAY ON GODS GREEN EARTH YOULL EVER GET THIS PASSED BECAUSE THE GIANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL FIGHT YOU EVERY INCH OF THE WAY.
WE HAVE TO WRAP IT UP.
ALL RIGHT.
SO HERES WHAT HAPPENED.
I GOT IN THE FIGHT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED IT INTO LAW AND HE WAS THE ONE WHO STOOD THERE WHEN EVERYONE ELSE SAID IN HIS ADMINISTRATION THROW THAT AGENCY UNDER THE BUS AND HE SAID NO IM NOT GOING TO LET THIS CRISIS PASS AND NOT COME AWAY WITH A CONSUMER AGENCY THAT MAKES SURE THAT FAMILIES EVER GET CHEATED AGAIN.
ILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT.
UP NEXT VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
WELL BE RIGHT BACK.
