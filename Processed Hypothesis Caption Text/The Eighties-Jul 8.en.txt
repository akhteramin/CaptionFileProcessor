 IT SEEMS THAT TELEVISION HAS BECOME AN ELECTRONIC CONFESSIONAL.
IT IS EXCITING STUFF.
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
ANY TOOL FOR HUMSSION WORST IN US ANDIONk BEEN THERE.
HERES MICHAEL AT THE FOUL LINE.
GOOD!
PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THEY WATCH TELEVISION.
HELLO.
PEOPLE USED TO SAY I WAS THERE.
NOW THEY SAY THEY WATCH IT ON TELEVISION.goo L1 1 SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE 1970s ARE DISAPPEARING.
THE 1980s WILL BE UPON US.
WHAT A DECADE IT IS COMING UP.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
AS YOU BEGIN THE 80s IN THE TELEVISION WO font colorff00ff LLLLLLfont WAS ON ANY GIVEN EVENING NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE WATCHING ONLY ONE OF THREE NETWORKS.
MORE THAN 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO IT.
SOCIAL CRITICS ARE MYSTIFIED BY ITS SUCCESS.
WHAT IS IT?
ITS TELEVISIONS PRIME TIME PRAIRIE POT BOILER DALLAS.
A MOVE LIKE THAT WILL DESTROY ALL OF THE OIL.
AND ITLL RUIN OUR NAME.
BROTHER OR NO BROTHER ILL STOP YOU FROM DESTROYING OIL.
DALLAS DID ESTABLISH NEW GROUNDS IN TERMS OOF A ONEHOUR SHOW THAT CAPTIVATED AMERICA FOR 13 YEARS.
DALLAS IS A TELEVISION SHOW ROOTED IN THE 1970s.
AND ONE OF THE CRAZY THINGS THAT EMERGES IS THIS CHARACTER HAS A POP PHENOMENON.
TELL ME J.R. WHICH SLUT ARE YOU GOING TO STAY WITH TONIGHT?
ITS GOT TO BE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE SLUT IM LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.
HE WAS SUCH A DELICIOUS VILLAIN.
EVERYONE WAS ENAMORED BY THIS CHARACTER.
AT THIS POINT SO MANY PEOPLE WERE WATCHING TELEVISION THAT YOU COULD DO SOMETHING SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT WOULD BECOME NEWS OVERNIGHT.
WHO IS HE?
THE NATIONAL OBSESSION IN 1980 AROUND WHO SHOT J.R.
ITS HARD TO IMAGINE HOW OBSESSED WE ALL WERE WITH THAT QUESTION.
BUT WE WERE.
WHO SHOT J.R. IS ABOUT AS IDEAL A CLIFFHANGER AS YOU POSSIBLY COULD GET.
WHO DID.?
WE MAY NEVER GET THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.
THE PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE THAT PROGRAM ARE GOING TO KEEP US IN SUSPENSE AS LONG AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.
WE SHOT J.R. AND THEN WE BROKE FOR THE SUMMER.
THEN COINCIDENTALLY THE ACTORS WENT ON STRIKE.
IT DELAYED THE RESOLUTION AND IT JUST STARTED TO PERCOLATE THROUGH THE WORLD.
I REMEMBER GOING ON VACATION TO ENGLAND THAT SUMMER AND THATS ALL THAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THERE.
WELL WE KNOW YOU DONT DIE.
I MEAN YOU COULDNT DIE.
WE DONT KNOW THAT.
HOW COULD YOU DIE?
YOU COULDNT COME BACK NEXT SEASON.
THATS WHAT I MEAN.
I COULDNT COME BACK BUT THE SHOW COULD STILL GO.
OH BUT YOU WOULDNT.
WHAT IS THAT SHOW WITHOUT J.R.?
WELL THATS WHAT I FIGURE YEAH.
I GUESS IF YOU DONT KNOW BY NOW WHO SHOT J.R. YOU PROBABLY DO NOT CARE.
LAST NIGHT SOME 82 MILLION AMERICANS DID.
AND THEY WATCHED THE MUCHTOUTED DALLAS EPISODE.
IT COULD BECOME THE MOSTWATCHED TELEVISION SHOW EVER.
WHO SHOT J.R. IS A REFLECTION OF OLDFASHIONED TELEVISION.
ITS A MOMENT THAT GATHERS EVERYBODY AROUND THE ELECTRONIC FIREPLACE WHICH IS NOW THE TELEVISION SET.
ONE SPECIAL AMERICAN TELEVISION PROGRAM.
CRITICS SAID IT TRANSCENDS IN POPULARITY EVER OTHER AMERICAN STATEMENT ABOUT WAR. AND SOMETHING SPECIAL HAPPENED TODAY TO MOBILE ARMY SURGICAL HOSPITAL 4077.
THAT WILL TOUCH MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
IT WAS THE KIND OF EVENT THAT WOULD DRAW THE WORLDS BREATH.
STAGE 9 20th CENTURY FOX STUDIOS THE END OF THE KOREAN WAR THE TELEVISION SEASON OF M.A.S.H.
ITS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE WORKED WITH YOU.
AND IM VERY VERY PROUD TO HAVE KNOWN YOU.
THERE WERE THOSE LANDMARK TIMES WHEN SHOWS THAT HAD BEEN WATCHED THROUGH THE 70s AND INTO THE 80s LIKE M.A.S.H.
HAD ITS FINAL EPISODE.
AND WE WERE ALL SAD TO SEE THEM GO.
ILL MISS YOU.
A LOT.
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARMIES OF FANS CROWDED AROUND TELEVISION SETS TO WATCH THE FINAL EPISODE AND TO BID M.A.S.H.
FAREWELL.
THE FINALE OF M.A.S.H.
WAS UNPRECEDENTED.
123 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED ONE TELEVISION PROGRAM AT THE SAME TIME.
YOU KNOW I REALLY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO HOME.
I THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.
WHEN WE ENDED THE SHOW WE GOT TELEGRAMS OF CONGRATULATIONS FROM HENRY KISSINGER AND RONALD REAGAN.
THE SIZE OF THE RESPONSE AND THE EMOTIONAL NATURE OF THE RESPONSE THAT WE WERE GETTING WAS DIFFICULT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND.
WHO SHOT J.R. AND THE LAST EPISODE OF M.A.S.H.
ARE THE LAST CALL FOR THE PRECABLE WORLD OF TELEVISION.
ITS LIKE THEY ARE THE LAST TIME THAT THAT HUGE AUDIENCE WILL ALL TURN UP FOR ONE EVENT.
TV IS GROWING UP WITH CABLE.
CONTENT.
DIFFERENT GENRES.
THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT CABLE DID AND THE VCR DID OR THE REMOTE CONTROL DID IS IT GAVE CONSUME .
AND EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

THOMAS MAGNUM.
THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR?
YOURE PROBABLY WONDERING ABOUT THE GOAT.
JUST LET ME DROP OFF MY FRIEND AND THEN WELL TALK.
WHEN WE ENTERED THE 80s A LOT OF ONEHOUR DRAMAS THAT WERE LIGHT HEARTED LIKE MAGNUM P.I.
WERE VERY POPULAR.
AFTER MASH WENT OFF THE HOUR THE NEXT SEASON THERE WASNT A SINGLE SITCOM IN THE TOP TEN FIRST TIME THAT HAD HAPPENED IN TV HISTORY.
THE PREVAILING FEELING WAS THE SI SITCOM DEAD.
BRANDON TARTIKOFF NBC PROGRAMMING CHIEF SAYS REPORTS OF THE SITCOMS DEATH WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED.
TIME AND TIME AGAIN IF YOU STUDY TELEVISION HISTORY JUST WHEN SOMEONE IS COUNTING A FORM OUT THATS EXACTLY THE FORM OF PROGRAMMING THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT BIG HIT.
1984 THE COSBY SHOW COMES ON.
BILL COSBY IS NOT NEW TO TV.
HES HAD OTHER TV SHOWS.
BUT THE COSBY SHOW IS VERY DIFFERENT.
IT STANDS APART FROM EVERYTHING ELSE HES DONE.
I WANTED MY EGGS SCRAMBLED.
COMING RIGHT UP.
THEY TALKED ABOUT PARENTING.
PREVIOUS TO THAT THE KIDS WERE COOL AND THE PARENTS WERE IDIOTS.
THEN COSBY SAYS THE PARENTS ARE IN CHARGE AND THAT WAS SOMETHING NEW.
INSTEAD OF ACTING DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IM NOT LIKE YOU MAYBE YOU CAN JUST ACCEPT WHO I AM AND LOVE ME ANYWAY BECAUSE IM YOUR SON.
 APPLAUSE  THATS THE DUMBEST THING IVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!
 LAUGHTER  IT HELPS THE CASTING A LOT IN TELEVISION.
THE KIDS WERE JUST GREAT.
IF YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON ON THIS EARTH I STILL WOULDNT TELL YOU.
YOU DONT HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU DID.
JUST TELL ME WHAT THEYRE GONNA DO TO YOU.
UNLIKE EVERY OTHER SHOW ON TV ITS SHOWING AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS BLACK FAMILY.
THIS WASNT ALL IN THE FAMILY.
THEY WERENT TACKLING DEEP ISSUES.
BUT THAT WAS OKAY.
THE MERE FACT THEY EXISTED WAS A DEEP ISSUE.
THE DECADE WAS WAR p SOMETHING REAL.
IN OTHER WORDS UNLESS ITS REAL IT DOESNT SEEM LIKE IT MOVES ANYBODY.
IF SOMEONES FEELING SOMETHING YOU GET TO THE HEART YOU GET TO THE MIND.
AND IF YOU CAN HIT THE HEARTS AND MINDS YOUVE GOT YOURSELF A HIT.
HOW WAS SCHOOL?
DEAR I BROUGHT HOME TWO CHILDREN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE OURS.
COSBYS SHOW BROUGHT THIS TREMENDOUS AUDIENCE TO NBC.
AND THAT WAS A BS.
I MEAN OUR RATINGS WENT WAY UP.
 SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO GO WHER EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME  EVEN THE THEME SONG TO CHEERS PUTS YOU IN A GOOD MOOD.
EVENING EVERYBODY.
NORM!
NORMAN!
WHATS SHAKING NORM?
ALL FOUR CHEEKS AND A COUPLE OF CHINS COACH.
BY THE END OF THE CHEERS PILOT NOT ONLY DID YOU KNOW WHO EVERYBODY WAS BUT YOU WANTED TO COME BACK AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
ITS LIKE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WATCH IT ONCE.
YOURE GOING TO LOVE THESE hh THESE ARE UNIVERSAL CHARACTERS AND THE HUMOR WORKED ON SO MANY LEVELS.
I WAS UP UNTIL 200 IN THE MORNING FINISHING OFF KIERKEGAARD.
I HOPE HE THANKED YOU FOR IT.
YOU HAVE TO CREATE A COMMUNITY THAT PEOPLE ARE IDENTIFYING WITH.
AND CHEERS GIVES YOU THAT BOY I TELL YOU IVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SKYDIVE.
IVE JUST NEVER HAD THE GUTS.
WHATS DID IT FEEL LIKE?
I IMAGINE A LOT LIKE SEX.
I WOULD HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT SEX IS LIKE.
BUT I HAVE PLENTY OF SEX.
AND PLENTY OF THIS TOO.
WHY DONT YOU JUST GET OFF MY IN THE FIRST EPISODE THERE WAS A RATHER PASSIONATE ANNOYANCE.
I WAS SAYING AH SOMETHINGS GOING ON HERE.
A REALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN WOULD SEE YOUR LINE OF B.S.
A MILE AWAY.
IVE NEVER MET AN INTELLIGENT WOMAN THAT ID WANT TO DATE.
ON BEHALF OF THE INTELLIGENT WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD MAY I JUST SAY WHEW!
WE SAW WHAT TED AND SHELLY HAD TOGETHER WE SAID OH NO WEVE GOT TO DO THIS RELATIONSHIP.
TED AND I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WERE WRITING RIGHT AWAY.
IF YOULL ADMIT THAT YOU ARE CARRYING A LITTLE TORCH FOR ME ILL ADMIT THAT IM CARRYING A WELL I AM.
YOU.
CARRYING A LITTLE TORCH FOR YOU.
WELL IM NOT CARRYING ONE FOR YOU.
DIANE KNEW HOW TO TEASE SAM.
SAM KNEW HOW TO TEASE DIANE ANU THI BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM IGNITED THE SHOW.ATSDROVE THE SHOW FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS.
WHATS THE MATTER?
OH IM DEVASTATED.
I NEED SOMETHING EXPEDITIOUS AND BRUTAL TO NUMB MY SENSIBILITIES AND BLAST ME INTO SWEET OBLIVION.
HOW ABOUT A BOILERMAKER?
MAKE IT A MIMOSA.
WE HAD THE LUCK TO BE ABLE TO ROTATE CAST AND EVERY TIME WE PUT SOMEBODY IN THEY WERE EXPLOSIONS.
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL ABOUT THAT SETTING THOSE CHARACTERS THAT I NEVER GOT TIRED OF WRITING THAT SHOW.
SOPHISTICATED SURVEYS TELEPHONIC SAMPLINGS TEST AUDIENCES.
ALL OF THOSE THINGS HELP TO SEPARATE WINNERS FROM LOSERS AND MAKE MIDCOURSE CORRECTIONS.
BUT YOU CANT CUT ALL COMEDIES FROM THE SAME COOKIE CUTTERS.
ALL YOU CAN HOPE IS EVERY NIGHT TURNS OUT LIKE THURSDAY.
YO ANGELA!
NEXT!
HOW RUDE.
HES QUICK ILL GIVE HIM THAT.
ALL OF TELEVISION SAID OH WELL MAYBE THE SITCOMS ARE ALIVE AGAIN.
AND THATS ALL THAT IT TOOK.
IT TOOK ONE SUCCESS.
A FEW YEARS FROM NOW SOMETHING NEW MAY TEMPT THE PEOPLE WHO PICK WHAT WE SEE.
BUT ITS A VERY SAFE GUESS THAT WHATEVER GETS HOT FOR A SEASON OR TWO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CREATE GOOD TELEVISION COMEDY WILL BE LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK.

DISPATCH.
WE HAVE A 911.
ARMED ROBBERY IN PROGRESS.
WHEN QUALITY DOES EMERGE ON TELEVISION THE PHRASE TOO GOOD FOR TV IS OFTEN HEARD.
ONE RECENT NETWORK OFFERING THAT SEEMS TO DESERVE THAT PHRASE IS HILL STREET BLUES.
HILL STREET IS ONE OF THE CHANGING POINTS IN THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY OF THE HISTORY OF TV.
WE HAD ALL WATCH AID DOCUMENTARY ABOUT COPS AND HAD THIS REAL HAND HELD IN THE MOMENT QUALITY THAT WE WERE VERY E ENAMORED OF.
THE MINUTE YOU LOOKED AT IT IT LOOKED DIFFERENT.
IT HAD A MOOD TO IT.
YOU COULD ALMOST SMELL THE STALE COFFEE.
WE DIDNT WANT TO DO A STANDARD COP SHOW WHERE YOU KNOW YOU GOT A CRIME AND YOU GOT YOUR TWO COPS AND YOU GO OUT AND YOU CATCH THE BAD GUY SWEAT HIM AND HE CONFESSES AND THATS IT.
COPS HAVE PERSONAL LIVES THAT IMPACT THEIR BEHAVIOR IN PROFOUND WAYS.
WELL WHAT ABOUT IT?
IS HE HERE OR IS HE ELSEWHERE?
DONT GET EXCITED COSTA WERE WORKING ON IT.
HOW IS THIS FOR LOGIC?
IF HES NOT HERE AND HES NOT ELSEWHERE HES LOST.
WE DIDNT SAY THAT COUNSELOR  NOT LOST.
NEVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE HAVE I LISTENED TO SO MUCH INCOMPETENCE COVERED UP BY SO MUCH UNMITIGATED CRAP.
FIND MY CLIENT OR I SWEAR ILL HAVE YOU UP ON CHARGES.
THERE WOULD BE THESE ONGOING ARCS FOR THESE CHARACTERS THAT WOULD PLAY OUT OVER FIVE SIX EPISODES SOMETIMES AN ENTIRE SEASON.
AND IN A WAY FOR CERTAIN STORIES OVER THE ENTIRE SERIES.
AND NO ONE HAD REALLY DONE THAT IN AN HOURLONG DRAMATIC SHOW.
THESE PAST FOUR MONTHS IVE MISSED YOU.
I HAD TO FIND THAT OUT.
COME HOME PIZZA MAN.
I THINK IN THE PAST PEOPLE HAD WATCHED TELEVISION PASSIVELY.
AND THE ONE THING I THINK WE DID SET OUT TO BE WERE PROVOCATEURS.
YOU WANT ACTION?
YOU FILL IT OUT.
WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MAN?
ILL TELL YOU SOMETHING THEY DONT PAY ME ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH ANIMALS LIKE THIS!
THE FIRST THING THEY SEE IS A WHITE FACE AND THEY WANT  LISTEN TO ME IT WAS A WHITE FINGER THAT PULLED THE TRIGGER NOT A BLACK ONE IT WAS A WHITE!
IT SET A TREND.
THE IDEA THE AUDIENCE CAN ACCEPT ITS CHARACTERS   THIS UNIFORM.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO FINALLY GET ACROSS.
NO BITING!
WE WANTED TO MAKE A SHOW THAT MADE YOU PARTICIPATE.
PAY ATTENTION.
AND I THINK THAT WORKED PRETTY WELL.
AND THE WINNER IS  HILL STREET BLUES.
WE GOT 21 NOMINATIONS AND WE WENT ON TO WIN EIGHT EMMYS.
AND IT PUT US ON THE MAP LITERALLY.
THATS WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY CHECKED US OUT.
PROGRAMMING CHIEF OF ONE OF THE NETWORKS USED TO SAY TO ME ABOUT SHOWS LIKE HILL STREET AND ST.
ELSEWHERE WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WANTS IS A CHEESE BURGER AND WHAT YOURE TRYING TO GIVE THEM IS A FRENCH DELICACY.
AND HE SAID YOUR JOB IS TO KEEP SHOVING IT DOWN THEIR THROAT UNTIL AFTER A WHILE THEYLL SAY THAT DOESNT TASTE BAD AND MAYBE THEYLL EVEN ORDER IT THEMSELVES WHEN THEY GO TO THE RESTAURANT.
NICE FOR YOU TO JOIN US.
THE SUCCESS OF HILL STREET BLUES INFLUENCED EVERYTHING THAT CAME AFTER.
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU SAW SHOWS LIKE ST.
ELSEWHERE.
Ynnnnnnnn THIS?
ST.
ELSEWHERE.
A PLACE YOU WOULDNT WANT TO  WHEN IT FIRST CAME ON IT WAS PROMOTED AS HILL STREET HOSPITAL.
YOU GIVE YOUR PATIENTS THE WRONG ANTIBIOTICS.
YOU DONT KNOW WHAT MEDICATIONS THEYRE ON.
YOU WRITE THE WORST PROGRESS NOTES.
YOURE PATHETIC.
PATHETIC!
PHIL!
WHAT?
DR.
MORNING NEEDS YOU RIGHT AWAY.
IM SORRY.
ST.
ELSEWHERE BROKE EVERY RULE THERE WAS AND THEN BUILT SOME NEW RULES.
BOBBY THE BLOOD BANK CALLED A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
THEY RAN A ROUTINE PANEL ON THAT PINT OF BLOOD.
TCELL COUNT WAS OFF.
THEY WOULD HAVE TRAGIC THINGS HAPPEN TO THESE CHARACTERS.
THERE WAS REAL HEARTACHE IN THESE PEOPLES LIVES AND YOU REALLY FELT FOR THEM.
IVE GOT AIDS?
TELEVISION AT ITS BEST IS A MIRROR OF SOCIETY IN THE MOMENT.
ST.
ELSEWHERE CHALLENGED PEOPLE AND THEY CHALLENGED YOU AS AN ACTOR MUCH LESS THE AUDIENCE TO THINK.
THE STUFF THEY GAVE YOU WAS EXTREME IN WHAT THEY DID WHETHER THEY WERE DEALING WITH AIDS OR HAVING ONE OF THEIR MAIN DOCTOR CHARACTERS RAPED IN A PRISON.
THEY TACKLED LOTS OF DIFFICULT SUBJECTS.
ST.
ELSEWHERE WAS RUN BY PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO STRETCH THE MEDIUM.
AND IN THE 80s TELEVISION PRODUCERS WERE ENCOURAGED TO STRETCH THE MEDIUM.
OKAY.
CLEAR.
AS THE 80s GOT SERIOUS THERE WAS MORE DRAMA.
THEY WERE GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVENTUROUS WITH THE TYPES OF SHOWS THAT WERE GETTING A SHOT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IM DOIN DONE ALL ALONG.
WHAT I WANTED TO DO ORIGINALLY.
SHOULD HAVE DONE LAST NIGHT.
STOP THAT DAVID.
IM CALLING THE POLICE DAVID.
HELLO POLICE?
THE NETWORKS REALIZED THERE WAS AN AUDIENCE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LESS PREDICTABLE THAN TRADITIONAL PRIME TIME FAIR.
MOONLIGHTING WAS ANOTHER SHOW THAT SAID OKAY I SEE THE FORMULAS WEVE HAD UP TO HERE.
LETS DO DIFFERENT THINGS.
HELLO.
WERE LOOKING A LITTLE PALE TODAY ARENT WE?
WHO HAVE WE HERE?
I DONT KNOW.
MOONLIGHTING WAS A REALLY EXPERIMENTAL SHOW.
THEY HAD A SHAKESPEARE EPISODE.
BLACK AND WHITE EPISODE.
THEY DID A MUSICAL EPISODE.
THEY TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT STUFF.
I DONT GIVE A FLYING FIG ABOUT THE LINES IN MY FACE THE CROWS FEET BY MY EYES OR THE ALTITUDE OF MY CABOOSE.
WELL IM AT A LOSS.
I DONT KNOW WHAT A FLYING FIG IS.
THATS OKAY.
THEY DO.
THERES NO TROUBLE ON THE SET.
THERE IS NO TROUBLE ON THE SET.
WELL WE HAVE A VERY VOLATILE RELATIONSHIP.
THERE IS A HATELOVE ELEMENT TO IT.
EASY COME EASY GO!
THE FLIRTATIONS WERE GREAT AND BRUCE AND CYBILL WERE GREAT.
GLENN CARON KEPT THEM APART FOR A LONG TIME AND BRAVO TO HIM.
WHAT THEY DID IS THEY TOOK THE SAM AND DIANE DYNAMIC FROM CHEERS AND ESCALATED IT.
CHEERS WAS WILL THEY WONT THEY?
MOONLIGHTING WAS DO THEY EVEN WANT TO?
STAY AWAY FROM ME.
HERE I COME.
BUT I DONT WANT YOU.
I NEVER WANTED YOU.
YEAH RIGHT.
DOES ENTERTAINING MEAN AT SOME POINT STOPPING THE TEASE OF DAVE AND MATTIE?
DO THEY GET TOGETHER AT SOME POINT?
I HOPE SO.
WELL THATS GOING TO BE RESOLVED THIS YEAR.
WE LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF FOREPLAY.
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING MOONLIGHTING FOR YEARS WERE WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT.
AND YOUR EMOTIONS ARE ALREADY THERE BUILT ON TO THE EMOTIONS THAT YOURE SEEING ON THE SCREEN.
SO WHEN BE MY BABY BY THE RONETTES STARTS PLAYING ITS LIKE A PERFECT STORM OF ROMANCE.
 THE NIGHT WE MET I KNEW I NEEDED YOU SO  join TMobile.re even more reao One Do you like Stranger Things?

But its not really something you want to buy.

But since you need both car and home insurance why not bundle the Esurance?
