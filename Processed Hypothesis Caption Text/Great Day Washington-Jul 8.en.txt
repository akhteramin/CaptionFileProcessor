GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO GREAT DAY WASHINGTON.

CHRISTEN IS OUT TODAY BUT IF YOU ARE AT HOME AND LOOKING FOR A MATE WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT DIGITAL DATING TIP THIS IS MORNING
PLUS WE'RE SHARING HOW A GROUP OF LOCAL SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING HARD TO COMBAT POLLUTION.
FIRST LET'S GET OVER TO WUSA 9 METEOROLOGIST HOWARD BERNSTEIN FOR AN UPDATE ON THE FLASH FLOOD WARNING WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING.
WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME FLOODING RIGHT NOW.

THESE ARE FLOOD WARNINGS FROM FREDERICK INTO SOUTHERN GEORGE COUNTY.
THESE ARE THE WORST, MOST DANGEROUS TYPE OF FLOODING AND HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY.
IT ONLY TAKES A FOOT, TWO FEET OF WATER TO PUSH YOUR CAR OFF THE ROAD SO THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR TURNED AROUND,
DON'T DROWN.
EVEN HOWARD COUNTY UNDER A FLASH FLOOD COUNTY UNTIL 11:45.
AND MONTGOMERY SEEING SOME HEAVY RAIN. MERI AND I WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PRESIP INTENSITY IN THE FIVE PLUS INCHES PER HOUR SO THESE ARE TROPICAL DOWNPOURS CAUSING SOME FLASH FLOODING,
BUT A NUMBER OF WATER RESCUES IN FREDERICK AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY.
I-66 SOUTH SEEMS TO BE THE HEAVIEST.
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE HEAVY RAIN MOVE IN AND EVERYWHERE ORANGE AND RED, VERY, VERY HEAVY RAINFALL FROM FedEx FIELD ACROSS THE HEART OF D.C.
MOVING TOWARDS THE HEART OF ALEXANDRIA.
OUR FRIENDS IN MT. VERNON, AND PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY,
GENERALLY SOUTH OF JOINT BASE ANDREWS, GET READY AS THIS WHOLE MASS OF WATER IS MOVING TOWARDS YOU WITH THE FLASH FLOOD WARNING UNTIL 11:15, AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE BETTER WEATHER.
ONCE WE GET RID OF THE STUFF THIS MORNING WE'LL SEE THE ACTIVITY SHIFT OFF TO THE SOUTH AND WEST AS WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON.
THE NEXT ONE TO TWO HOURS COULD BE PARTICULARLY BAD TWO FLOODING BUT IT WILL GET BETTER THIS AFTERNOON.
I HOPE SO.
THIS IS A LIVE LOOK AT THE BELTWAY.
WE HAD A CLOSURE.
THEY JUST OPENED A 2 LEFT LANE ON THE INNER LOOP BY THE AMERICAN LEGION BRIDGE.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS A TREE THAT FELL ON TO A VEHICLE AND CAUSED SOME SORT OF ACCIDENT.
THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE IT OVER TO THE RIGHT HAND SIZE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S THE INNER LOOP OF THE BELTWAY,
COMING FROM THE SPRINGFIELD INTERCHANGE.

I270,
THE BELTWAY IS NOT LOOKING GOOD,
AND WE'VE HAD MANY RISK YOUS UP IN FREDERICK, AS WELL, FOLLOWING FREDERICK COUNTY, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S TWITTER PAGE.

THESE ARE JUST THE MAIN STREETS, NOT EVEN SIDE STREETS.
