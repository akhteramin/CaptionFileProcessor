 HURT ME.
LeBRON WAS JULY 9th JULY 10th.
KEVIN DURANT WAS JULY 4th.
ITS NOT UNUSUAL.
WEVE SEEN SUCH AN ACCELERATION IN THE WAY FREE AGENCY WORKS.
WEVE NEVER SEEN THIS MUCH MONEY.
NO.
ITS OVER 4 MILLION.
WERE ON DAY FOUR.
CALM DOWN.
BE ZEN.
WELL GET YOU THROUGH THE KAWHI LIGHT ZONE.
WERE BACK TONIGHT AT 700 EASTERN.
COME RIGHT BACK.
WELL BE HERE WAITING FOR YOU.
DOUG STRAIGHT AHEAD ON DAILY WAGER THE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER ARE HERE.
HOW A HOLIDAY HEAT WAVE COULD AFFECT BASEBALL TOTALS ACROSS THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND COULD THAT SUNSHINE ALSO AFFECT HOT DOGS CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY ESPN INC. DOUG WE HOPE TO MAKE YOU A MORE INFORMED SPORTS BETTER.
WE HAVE A PACKED SHOW COMING UP.
WHO KNOWS KAWHI COULD MAYBE MAKE A DECISION AT ANY SECOND E AND THAT WOULD TURN THE NBA FUTURE ODDS UPSIDE DOWN.
UNTIL THEN LETS GET ROLLING WITH THE REST OF THE SHOW WHICH INCLUDES THE SUBWAY SERIES.
FIRST PITCH ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY.
METS BEAT THE YANKS LAST NIGHT.
HE HAD AN E.R.A.
IN 8 12 BEFORE A HIP INJURY.
JASON VARGAS HE IS 2.36 E.R.A.
IN THE LAST SEVEN STARTS.
THE BOMBERS ARE FAVORED FOR THE GAME AND THE FIRST FIVE AND THE RUN TOTAL IS TEN.
JOE JOINS ME FROM THE BAY AREA HERE.
JOE WHATS YOUR PLAY IN THIS ONE.
JOE IT MAY SOUND CRAZY BUT I LIKE THE METS AT PLUS 130 IN THIS MATCHUP.
THE YANKS SCORED JUST TWO RUNS IN THAT GAME LAST NIGHT AGAINST THE METS.
THAT WAS JUST THE THIRD TIME IN THEIR LAST 39 GAMES THAT THEY SCORED TWO OR FEWER RUNS.
NOW A LOT OF THAT IS DUE CREDIT TO ZACH WHEELER AND THE METS BULLPEN WHICH SHOWED UP LAST NIGHT BUT I GOT TO WONDER AFTER THAT SERIES ACROSS THE POND AGAINST THE RED SOX MAYBE THERES A LITTLE JET LAG AND FATIGUE AT PLAY HERE FOR THE YANKEES.
DUG IVE HEARD THE WHOLE JET LAG THING BUT THE BOSTON RED SOX DID PUT UP TEN RUNS OR MAYBE THE BLUE JAYS WERE JUST THAT BAD YESTERDAY.
WE SHOULD SEE.
YOURE ON THE METS.
I KNOW I TALKED TO YOU YESTERDAY.
MY APOLOGIES.
YANKSMETS.
ONE OF JUST JUST ONE OF FIVE GAMES TONIGHT WITH A TOTAL OF AT LEAST TEN RUNS.
ASTROSROCKIES LEADING THE WAY WITH A TOTAL OF DOUG WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF OVERUNDER?
ITS AT ASTROSROCKIES UNDER MY PROJECTION IS 13.1 RUNS AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR 9MILEANHOUR WINDS AND IT ACTS FOR THE FACT THAT THEYRE PLAYING AT COORS FIELD.
WE EVEN TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY ITS CRAZY HAVING THESE ASTROS BATS.
THEYRE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ROCKIES HITTING IN COORS FIELD AND I STILL LOOKING AT THIS THIS GUY HAS BEEN JUST STELLAR FOR TWO YEARS AND IF YOU SAY OH COME ON FROM THE AMERICAN LEAGUE PITCHING IN COORS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS WITH THE DIAMONDBACKS.
HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PITCHING IN COORS.
EXPECTED BATTING AVERAGE AGAINST ALL OF THESE METRICS AND ON THE OTHER SIDE LAMBERT HE IS THE NUMBER ONE PROSPECT FOR THE ROCKIES.
THAT IS THE CONCERN SOME IS THAT THE ASTROS JUST GO NUTS.
I HAVE IT RIGHT AT 13 ALMOST.
I GOT TO GO UNDER.
DOUG ON THOSE LIST OF DOUBLE DIGIT TOTALS I WOULD GO OVER 11 12 WITH THE PHILLIES AND BRAVES.
BOTH PITCHERS HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED.
BRYCE WILSON E.R.A.
OVER EIGHT AND IM NOT GOING TO OVER THINK IT.
ILL TAKE THE OVER IN THAT ONE.
PRESTON SIT TIGHT FOR THAT AND JOE WHAT ABOUT YOU ON THAT LIST OF OVERUNDER AND DOUBLE DIGITS?
WHICH ONE JUMPED OUT TO YOU?
PERHAPS THE SECOND HALF OF THE DOUBLEHEADER.
THEYRE TIRED.
THEYVE BEEN OUT ON THE DIAMOND ALL DAY.
THIS KID WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM A LITTLE BIT AND NOT ONLY THAT CHICAGO IS ABOUT MIDDLE OF THE PACK IN OPS AGAINST LEFTHANDED PITCHING.
NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION SAYS ITS GOING TO BE ROSS DETWIELER WHO EARNED HIS MAJOR LEAGUE VICTORY IN THREE YEARS HIS FIRST TIME OUT A WEEK AGO.
WENT UP AGAINST MINNESOTA.
LOOKED REALLY SHARP.
GAVE UP JUST TWO EARNED RUNS IN FIVE INNINGS PITCHED.
HE WILL GO UP AGAINST THE TIGER LINEUP TONIGHT.
THATS 25th IN OPS AGAINST LEFTHANDED PITCHING.
I THINK THE PITCHERS HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SUCCESS.
WE PLAY THE UNDER 10 12 RUNS.
WHITE SOXTIGERS.
DOUG SOUNDS GOOD.
SIT TIGHT.
MUCH MORE FROM YOU AND PRESTON THROUGHOUT THE SHOW AND WE TALKED COLLEGE FOOTBALL IN RECENT SHOWS.
BIG TEN YESTERDAY.
I ALSO COVERED THE S.E.C.
A LITTLE ACC.
HERES A LOOK AT YOUR HIGHEST SIXTH HIGHEST WIN TOTALS COURTESY OF CEASARS FOR THE COMING SEASON.
NO SURPRISE.
CLEMSON WITH A SIZABLE GAP OVER THE REST OF THE CONFERENCE.
11 12 MINUS 110 EITHER SIDE.
OBVIOUSLY TREVOR LAWRENCE RETURNS FOR THE DEFEND DEFENDING NATIONAL CHAMPIONS.
MIAMI AT 8 12.
VIRGINIA EASTBOUNDING IT AT 8 AND A TRIO OF NC STATE SYRACUSE AND VIRGINIA ALL AT 7 12.
JUICES ON THAT.
LETS WELCOME IN THE BEAR CHRIS FELICA AND STANFORD STEVE.
I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE CLOSE.
THE BEAR ABSOLUTELY.
LETS GO.
DOUG IM GOING TO START WITH THE DEFENDING CHAMPS.
CLEMSON 11 12.
UNDER.
DOUG OVER.
LOOK THIS IS SCI OUR FOOTBALL POWER INDEX PROJECTS THEM TO WIN ALL THEIR GAMES BY AT LEAST 20 EXCEPT FOR TWO.
HOME TO AM AND THATS 15 AND THEN AT SOUTH CAROLINA 18.
ALL OF THEM BY AT LEAST TWO TOUCHDOWNS.
THEYRE ONLY KIND OF QUESTIONABLE GAMES ARE AT HOME OR JUST NOT THAT IT SHOULD BE WIRE TO WIRE.
I THINK ALABAMA BEING IN THE RACE YOURE GOING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT.
WELL KEEP THEM ON POINTED.
WE TEND TO THINK OH CLEMSON ALWAYS WILL DROP ONE.
THEY DIDNT LAST YEAR.
WE CANT ASSUME THAT AND I THINK OVER THE WHOLE CLEMSON THING THATS LONG GONE.
THE ONLY THING THAT I I WOULD PLAY THE OVER ON THAT AS WELL.
THE ONLY THING I WOULD THAT COULD TRIP THEM UP IS THE INJURY WHICH NOBODY WANTS TO SEE BUT  DOUG THEYRE AM AT HOME.
THE SCHEDULE IS FAVORABLE FOR THEM TO RUN THE TABLE.
I THINK THE CONFERENCE IS TERRIBLE.
DOUG BRUTAL.
FIRE AWAY.
ALL RIGHT.
ILL START.
ON THE OTHER SIDE I LOOK AT FLORIDA STATE OKAY?
NOW THEY WERE AT A DISASTER LAST YEAR OKAY?
THEY WON FIVE GAMES.
THEY STARTED NINE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
OKAY?
YOU KNOW QUARTERBACKS WERE COMING IN AND OUT OF THERE.
DEFENSIVELY THEY WERE AWFUL.
THEY DIDNT RANK IN THE TOP 1 00 IN ANY DEFENSIVE CATEGORIES.
THE BEAR THEY WERE ON SHORT FIELD.
I THINK THEY AVERAGE THE 265 YARDS A GAME.
21 POINT GUYS ARE HAVING TO PLAY.
DUG WHO THE KOECHSZ?
A LOT OF REASONS.
WITH THE COMBINATIONS OF ROSTER OKAY AND THEN THE SCHEDULE OKAY I THINK ITS DOABLE.
THE NUMBER 7.
THEY HAVE THE TALENT TO DO IT.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE FIVE OF THE TEAMS ALL RIGHT WON NINE GAMES LAST YEAR.
THATS A BIG DROPOFF.
THOSE TEAMS LOST A LOT OF GAMES.
AND I THINK ITS PRETTY FAVORABLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING.
I TAKE THREE GAMES THAT ARENT WINNABLE AT CLEMSON AT FLORIDA AT VIRGINIA.
THE BEAR WE TALKED LAST WEEK ABOUT THOSE LINES WHEN AT THE CAME OUT.
I LIKE FLORIDA STATE IN THAT GAME.
YOU CANNOT GO TO VIRGINIA WITH THE CHANCE THAT THEY COULD BE 12 OFF THE BAT OFF THE YEAR THAT YOU HAD LAST YEAR.
YOURE RIGHT.
YOU THINK KENDALL THE BIGGEST COORDINATOR HIRE.
MAYBE EVEN HIM OR AL FINCH.
DOUG YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITH?
BLACKMAN TWO YEARS AGO.
DOUG IS THE NUMBER ONE RECRUIT.
HE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IN FLORIDA AND HE HAS ANOTHER YEAR TO IMPLEMENT ALL THOSE GUYS.
NOT WHO IS GOING TO PLAY SKREM E CLEMSON AND WHO IS THE SECOND BEST TEAM?
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS AGO YOU ASKED A QUESTION WHEN WE DID LIKE THE KENTUCKY DERBY.
SYRACUSE THEY LOOKED GREAT.
DOUG FPI SAYS 8.1 WIN.
ALL THOSE GUYS ARE DEFENSE.
GONE.
IM ON THE UNDER THIS YEA I DONT KNOW IF YOU CAN LINE UP THAT OFFENSIVE LINE AND DEAL 35 TIMES LIKE THEY WANT.
THEY HAVE A COORDINATOR CHANGE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL.
WELL SEE HOW THAT GOES.
THEYVE BEEN A SIX OR SEVEN WIN TEAM EVERY YEAR UNDER HIM.
YOU LOOK AT VIRGINIA TECH TO START THE OPENING UP.
THEY SHOULD WIN THE NEXT THREE.
IM HIGH ON WAKE FOREST.
I THINK THEYRE GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD.
LOOK AT THE WAY THEY FINISH.
THOSE FINAL FIVE GAMES IF THEY HAVENT GOTTEN TO SEVEN BY THE TIME THEY GO TO CLEMSON THEYRE NOT GOING TO.
STEVE THATS WHY I LIKE FLORIDA STATE OVER AND  THEY JUST RELOAD.
SOMETHING LIKE BC  THEY DEVELOP PRAYERS AND FIND GUYS THAT THEY GET INTO THEIR SYSTEM AND I THINK ITS A YOUNG OFFENSIVE LINE.
IM THINKING THEYRE.
DOUG 5.1.
STEVE DO YOU HAVE A CALCULATOR OVER THERE?
DOUG SPREADSHEET.
MY COMPUTER MODEL.
THE BEAR PROBABLY DID TAKE IT.
STEVE VIRGINIA AND I HAVE A THING.
THEY LOOK GOOD.
THE BEAR THEY DO?
DUG WE HAVE PRESENT OF TIME.
WE HAVE GAME ONE  WEEK ONE LINES WE CAN DISSECT AS WELL THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE SUMMER.
BEAR AND STANFORD STEVE HERE IN THE HOUSE.
WE ALL LIKE A LITTLE TENNIS ACTION.
ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING RIGHT?
FIRE AWAY ON BRAD GILBERT AND WIMBLEDON UNDERDOG GALORE.
WELL HAVE PATRICK McENROE NEXT WITH PICKS.
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON ANDREW LUCK PASSING TOUCHDOWNS THIS YEAR?
WELL BREAK IT DOWN AS DAILY WAGER ROLLS ON.
What makes DiGiorno Crispy Pan Pizza different than delivery?
 PAN PAN PAN PAAAAN  You bake it fresh in its own pan!
Giving our DiGiorno pizza a crispy caramelized crust.
 PAAAAN  Its not Delivery Its DiGiorno.

WIMBLEDON JUST RECAPPING SOME OF THE ACTION.
THE BIGGEST STORY PROBABLY IS COCO GAUF THE 15YEAROLD AMERICAN.
WHAT A STORY.
SHE WON TODAY AS A PLUS 155 UNDERDOG.
SHE MOVES ON FOR THE THIRD ROUND TO HERTZOG.
WE WENT OUT YESTERDAY AS A WINNER.
WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?
LOTS OF UPSETS SO FAR.
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE SPLIT SIX CAREER MEETINGS.
ON THE WOMENS SIDE 11 SEED SERENA WILLIAMS IS GOING TO FACE A QUALIFIER.
SHES A PERFECT 180 IN SECOND ROUND MATCHES IN THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB AND IS A MINUS 750 FAVORITE.
LETS TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER NOTABLE MATCHUPS AS WE CATCH OUR EYE.
ANG LEAK MINUS 950.
HEY YOU DONT LIKE THE BIG JUICE.
YOU DONT WANT TO LAY THE LUMBER.
YOU CAN ALWAYS DO A MONEY LINE PARLAY AND SAM QUERY WITH THE UPSET IS MINUS 460 IN HIS SECOND MATCH.
AS FOR A COUPLE OF POTENTIAL UPSETS AND OTHER PICKS LETS TURN IT OVER TO OUR PATRICK McENROE.
EXPECTING MORE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AND THE MATCH WEVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR ON THE MENS SIDE IN ROUND TWO THAT WILL BE BETWEEN THE TWOTIME CHAMP RAFAEL NADAL AND THE WHACKY ONE FROM AUSTRALIA NICK WHO CAN ALSO PLAY SERIOUS TENNIS PARTICULARLY ON GRASS.
REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HE UPSET NADAL RIGHT HERE AT WIMBLEDON ON CENTER COURT.
IM NOT EXPECTING THAT TO HAPPEN TOMORROW.
I THINK NADAL IS READY FOR THIS ACCIDENT HAVING WON THE FRENCH OPEN.
HE HAS SOME CONFIDENCE.
THIS IS HIS LEAST FAVORITE SURFACE.
THE FAVORITE.
HE HAS NOT LOOKED LIKE THE PLAYER HE WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
I EXPECT NADAL TO MAYBE DROP A SET BUT PROBABLY WIN THIS ONE IN FOUR SETS.
I EXPECT HER TO WIN COMFORTABLY IN STRAIGHT SETS.
BACK TO YOU DOUG.
DOUG PATRICK THANKS SO MUCH.
LOOK ITS INDEPENDENCE DAY AND FIRE AWAY IN THE MORNING THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.
YOU GOT SOME BASEBALL ON JULY 4th.
HE IS STREAMING LIVE ON THE ESPN APP.
WEVE BEEN TALKING A LOT OF PRO FOOTBALL PROPS.
TOURS OF EACH DIVISION.
WERE DOING THE SOUTH DIVISIONS THIS WEEK.
AC SOUTH WITH THE COLT.
PLAYER PROP COURTESY OF CEASARS.
ANDREW LUCK TOUCHDOWN TOTAL 32 12.
HE HAS GONE OVER JUST TWICE IN HIS FIVE FULL SEASONS.
MARLIN NEEDS A 1000 YARD RUSHING SEASON TO GO OVER HIS STOELGTS.
THE COLTS HAVE HAD ONE 1 000 YARD RUSHER IN THE LAST DECADE.
THAT WAS FRANK GORE IN LETS BRING IN NOW OUR MALE MODELERS PRESTON JOHNSON AND MIKE CLAY WHO HAVE SPREADSHEETS AND LAPTOPS IN HAND AS WE BREAK THIS DOWN.
ANDREW LUCK 32TD PASSES.
WHAT ARE YOUR NUMBERS SAYING MIKE?
MIKE GOING OVER ON THIS ONE.
THIS GUY IS 39 PASSING TOUCHDOWNS LAST SEASON.
THAT WAS SECOND MOST IN THE NFL BEHIND ONLY  YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM.
THE LAST TIME WE SAW ANDREW LUCK FOR A FULL 16 GAME SEASON HE HAD 40 PASSING TOUCHDOWNS AND REALLY THE KEY HERE IS OPPORTUNITY.
YOU HAVE AN OTD WHICH WAS SET ESSENTIALLY EXPECTED EXPECTED PASSING TOUCHDOWNS BASED ON YOUR OPPORTUNITY WHERE YOU ARE ON THE FIELD AND YOUR VOLUME OF THROWS.
LUCK LAST YEAR TOPS IN THE NFL.
THE KEY THROWN INTO THE END ZONE.
THE COLTS HAD 50 LAST SEASON.
THAT WAS MOST IN THE LEAGUE.
THIS OFFENSE STEPPED UP FOR HIM TO THROW A TON OF TOUCHDOWNS.
SOUNDS GOOD.
PRESTON WHAT ARE YOUR PROJECTIONS?
WE DO THIS EVERY DAY AND I HAD ANDREW LUCK AT 28 TOUCHDOWNS AND I COULDNT BELIEVE IT.
THERES NO WAY IM BETTING UNDER ON THIS.
IF YOU LOOK AT IT AND I AGREE WITH MIKE LIKE THERES SO MUCH VALUE HERE WITH ANDREW LUCK ASSUMING HE PLAYS A FULL SEASON.
IM NOT SURE HOW HE DOESNT GO OVER 32 12.
I ACTUALLY AM STAYING OFF OF THIS DESPITE MY PROJECTIONS POINTING TO AN EDGE ON THE UNDER BUT BECAUSE I AM LOWER ON ANDREW LUCKS PROJECTIONS THERE ARE SOME CORRELATED BETS WHICH WELL GET TO HERE IN A BIT WHICH I THINK ARE SAFER AND BETTER AS FAR AS SOME OF THE RECEIVERS GO?
BEING LOOK BACK AT THE LAST THREE SEASONS AND HOW THEYVE PLAYED TOGETHER IN FULL.
THEYVE BLOWN THIS NUMBER AWAY ALL THREE SEASONS.
THERES A FEW THINGS IN PLAY HERE.
ONE OF THE THEM IS DURABILITY.
HE HAS MISSED FOUR GAMES IN SEVEN SEASONS IN THE LEAGUE.
HE FINISHED TOP 17 IN RECEIVING YARDS.
EACH OF THE PAST SIX SEASONS.
GUYS HE HAS BEEN IN THE 80th PERCENT ILL OR BETTER IN YARDS PER RECEPTION EACH OF THE PAST FIVE SEASONS.
ITS ANDREW LUCK GOING THROUGH GUYS.
THIS IS A HIGH VOLUME PASSHEAVY OFFENSE AND I THINK HE GETS TO THAT NUMBER EASILY.
DOUG PRESTON AND YOU?
PRESTON THIS ONE WHERE WE DISAGREE.
IM CORRELATED HERE WITH NOT LOVING ANDREW LUCKS NUMBERS BUT HILTON I ATHE 1140 YARDS.
FOR ME THERE IS A SLIGHT EDGE TO THE UNDER AND YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF WHO LUCK WILL BE THROWING TO.
THEY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BRING IN DEVIN AND DRAFTED PARIS CAMPBELL OUT OF OHIO STATE WHO I THINK WILL BE STELLAR.
THEN HE PLAYED A BUNCH LAST YEAR AT TIGHT END.
DOYLE POLICED A LOT OF LAST SEASON.
I HAVE THOSE TWO TIGHTENDS COMBINED.
I THINK TY HILTON IS TARGET SHARE GOING DOWN.
I HAVE HIM UNDER 1200 YARDS.
ITS A BET UNDER FOR ME.
DOUG I LIKE WHEN YOU DISAGREE.
MIKE LETS GO TO YOU.
MARLIN MACK WILL HE BE A 1000 YARD RUSHER.
NOT COMBINED.
JUST RUSHING YARDS.
YES HE WILL.
HE SORT OF WAS LAST YEAR.
YOU LOOK AT HIS 14 GAMES INCLUDING THE PLAYOFFS.
HE HAD A LITTLE OVER 1100 YARDS AND THAT WAS WITH PLAYING A SITUATIONAL ROLE FOR A LOT OF THE EARLY PART SEASON.
THE GUY HAS BEEN TERRIFIC SINCE HE HAS ENTERED THE LEAGUE AND HE HAD 4.8 YARDS PER CARRY LAST SEASON.
YOU DONT WANT TO GET TOO WRAPPED UP IN YARDS PER CARRY BUT HE HAS BEEN ABOVE AVERAGE AFTER CONTACT PER ATTEMPTS IN BOTH OF THINKS NFL SEASONS.
HE HAD A LOT OF HELP LAST SEASON FROM QUINTON NELSON AS WELL.
HERES THE BIG ONE.
IN HIS LAST FIVE GAMES LAST SEASON HE HANDLED AT LEAST 75 OF THE COLTS DESIGNED RUNDZ AND EACH OF THOSE GAMES.
THE GUY IS WORKING HIS WAY INTO BECOMING A TWOMAN WORK HORSE FOR THIS COLTS OFFENSE.
I LIKE THE OVER A LOT HERE.
DOUG MIKE YOU ARE BULLISH ON THE COLTS OFFENSE.
YOU MENTIONED AIRCRAFT HEBRON A MOMENT AGO.
SIX AND A HALF TOUCHDOWNS FOR HIS PROP.
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED WITH THIS?
THIS IS ANOTHER GUT CHECK.
IM GOING WITH IT.
I HAVE PROJECTED 5.2 TOUCHDOWNS.
I MENTIONED JACK DOYLE IS BACK.
HE SHOULD BE HEALTHIER AND I PROJECT HIM TO HAVE A GOOD PORTION OF THE SECOND TIGHT END OF HIS POTENTIAL TARGET SHARE.
DEVIN THIS GUY IS AS FAR AS RED ZONE OPPORTUNITIES GO AND GOAL LINE OPPORTUNITIES HEBRON OUTSIDE OF LAST YEAR WHERE HE SCORED 13 TOUCHDOWNS THATS WHY ITS A GUT CHECK YOU SHOULD SIX AND A HALF.
HE NEVER GOT MORE THAN FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN A SEASON.
THAT WAS IN DETROIT.
MATTHEW STAFFORD IS NOT INEPT.
THERES SO MUCH GOING AROUND HERE FOR LUCK.
I HAVE TO GO UNDER.
DOUG AGAIN A LITTLE TECHNICALITY AT TOTAL TOUCHDOWNS.
A RECOVERED FUMBLE IN THE GOAL LINE.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
DOUG YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR SPREADSHEET AND REEVALUATE IT?
MORE TO COME FROM PRESTON STRAIGHT AHEAD.
AND FROM PLAYER PROP TO TEAM PROPS.
INDYS WIN TOTAL IS TEN WHICH IS WHEN THEY WON LAST YEAR.
THE OVER PLUS 110 AND THE YESNO TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS.
YES IS MINUS 1.75 WHICH THEY SURE IN FACT DID IN FRANK WRIGHTS FIRST SEASON WITH THE COLTS.
LETS GO OUT TO NEW YORK AND BRING IN OUR ANITA MARKS.
ANITA OVERUNDER TEN.
NOW I AM PASSING BECAUSE I THINK ITS GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE.
THEY HAVE TO FACE THE NFC SOUTH.
REALLY TOUGH SCHEDULE.
SUPPOSED TO BE A COMPETITIVE DIVISION.
ITS GOING TO BE RIGHT AROUND THERE.
IM GOING TO PASS.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ANITA IM ON THE OVER A LITTLE BIT.
IM NOT BANKING THE MORTGAGE ON THE OVER BUT I AM PUTTING A LITTLE MONEY ON THE OVER FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.
LETS TALK ABOUT THE SCHEDULE.
LETS TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE ACTUALLY.
I HAVE THEM WINNING THEIR DIVISION.
THE AFC SOUTH.
I THINK THEY SPLIT WITH HOUSTON.
I THINK THEY GO 20 AGAINST TENNESSEE.
THEY COULD POSSIBLY GO 20 AGAINST THE JAGUARS.
LOOKING AT 51 43 IN THEIR DIVISION.
EASY GAMES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OAKLAND DENVER AND MIAMI.
HERES WHERE IT GETS TOUGH.
LOOK AT THE ROAD GAMES IN THE QUARTERBACKS THEYRE GOING TO BE FACING.
YOU READY?
THE CHARGERS THE CHIEFS THE STEELERS THE TEXANS THE SAINTS.
ITS A TOUGH ROAD GAME.
I HAVE THEM GOING 32 ON THE ROAD SO ITS GOING TO BE CLOSE BUT I THINK THIS TEAM IS JUST SO GOOD DOUG THAT I HAVE THEM I AT 101  10 11 WINS.
DOUG I WAS DEFINITELY LEANING THAT WAY BUT IM GOING TO PASS.
AS FOR THE YESNO I LIKE THE YES TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS AT MINUS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE DIVISION BECAUSE YOU COULD GET TO THE PLAYOFFS AND NOT GET OVER TEN WINS.
NINE OR TEN WINS IN THIS DIVISION COULD WIN IT.
IM GOING TO SAY I LIKE THE YES TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS AT MINUS 1.75.
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE THE BONUS OF THE WILD CARD BUT THATS WHY IM DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN THAT AND OVER TEN WINS.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ANITA AGAIN I HAVE THEM WINNING THIS DIVISION.
I LOVE THIS TEAM.
OUT OF ALL THE 22 STARTERS ON OFFENSE AND DEFENSE THEY ONLY HAVE ONE GUY NOT COMING BACK.
THATS AMAZING.
THAT JUST DOESNT HAPPEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE IN FREE AGENCY.
ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST BALANCED TEAMS IN THE NFL.
FIRST AND THIRD DOWN CONVERSIONS IN 2018.
ANDREW LUCK WHEN HE IS HEALTHY HE IS A TOP FIVE QUARTERBACK.
HE HAS THE BEST OFFENSIVE LINE COMING IN.
WIDE RECEIVERS YOU GOT TO LOVE TY HILTON AND ADD DEVIN FUNCHES.
THEY DRAFT PAIR CAMPBELL.
I LOVE THE ONETWO PUNCH WITH THEIR TIGHT END.
EBRON TOOK A BIG STEP WITH THEM THIS YEAR AS OPPOSED WHAT WITH HE SAW IN DETROIT.
JACK DOYLE HE IS GOING TO BE HEALTHY.
THEN THEY ADD JUSTIN HOUSTON ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL SO I JUST LOVE THIS TEAM.
I THINK THEYRE GOING TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS.
I THINK THEY WIN THE DIVISION DOUG.
DOUG SOUNDS LIKE WERE ALL VERY POSITIVE ON THE COLTS.
THATS ANITA MARKS.
SHELL JOIN US LATER IN THE SHOW TO DISCUSS THE WEEKEND PGA TOURNAMENT.
THATS COMING UP LATER.
ANITA THERE YOU GO.

HERE AT THE DESK STANFORD STEVE HERE STANDING BY FOR YOUR BEST BET.
WELL GET THAT IN A MOMENT.
LETS GO BACK OUT TO LAS VEGAS.
PRESTON WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR YOUR BEST BET?
YOURE ON THE TEE BOX FIRST.
PRESTON THE GRIZZLIES MINUS 2 12.
THE ONLY GUY GETTING RUNS THAT HAS ANY PRO EXPERIENCE IS NAZ WHO PLAYED A TOTAL OF 85 MINUTES FOR THE JAZZ THE LAST TWO YEARS.
ON THE OTHER SIDE THIS MEMPHIS TEAM THIS IS A ROSTER FILLED WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS WHO PLAYED FAIRLY REGULAR MINUTES THE LAST TWO SEASONS WHEN MEMPHIS WAS TANKING.
ROB WASHBURN.
THESE GUYS TOTALED 63 POINTS I THINK ON MONDAY WHEN THEY PLAYED.
THEY ALL RESTED YESTERDAY.
NOW CARTER WORTH NOTING ACTUALLY JUST GOT TRADED TO THE SUNS.
PROBABLY WONT PLAY BECAUSE THEY CANT AFFORD HIM TO GET INJURED.
THESE OTHER THREE GUYS COMBINED FOR 34 POINTS.
THEY HAVE SO MUCH EXPERIENCE COMPARED TO THE CAVS WHO ARE PLAYING A BUNCH OF ROOKIES.
IT DOESNT IMPACT THE PROJECTION TOO MUCH TO BE MORE LIKE MINUS 5.
WERE GETTING 2 2 12 ON THE MARKET.
IM GOING WITH THE GRIZZLIES.
DOUG DO YOU BELIEVE IN REST DAYS IN VEGAS?
COME ON.
OR WAS THAT IN SALT LAKE.
PRESTON THIS ONE IS IN SALT LAKE.
DOUG FEWER DISTRACTIONS I WOULD THINK.
YOU WOULD THINK.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
DOUG PRESTON IS PLAYING HOME COURT ADVANTAGE.
HE IS OUT THERE IN LAS VEGAS.
JOE WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR YOUR BEST BET?
JOE THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS AT PLUS 120 OVER THE SAN DIEGO PADRES AS THEY LOOK FOR THE SWEEP TONIGHT.
THE GIANTS BATS HAVE COME ALIVE AS OF LATE.
THREE STRAIGHT WINS ALL OF WHICH HAVE FEATURED TEN OR MORE RUNS.
NOW TONIGHT THE PADRES WHO RANKED 19th AT OPS ARE GOING TO FACE GIANT RIGHTHANDER SEAN ANDERSON.
ANDERSON HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT PITCHER FOR THE GIANTS THIS SEASON.
A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY THINK THATS MADISON BUMGARNER.
GO BACK TO JUNE 12th.
HE FACED THE PADRE LINEUP.
FOUR HITS TWO EARNED RUNS IN SIX INNINGS PITCHED.
HE IS GOING TO TAKE THE MOUND FOR THE GIANTS WHICH IS THE BIG EDGE HERE.
HE IS EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED.
FOR THE PADRES ITS GOING TO BE THE YOUNGSTER CALTRON.
THE RIGHTY AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO.
IS HE COMING OUT OF THE BULLPEN TO MAKE HIS FIRST START IN A FEW WEEKS.
SIX STARTS THIS SEASON.
HE HAS AN E.R.A.
NORTH OF FIVE.
18 EARNED RUNS AND JUST 31 INNINGS PITCHED.
I LIKE THE GIANTS TO GET THE SWEEP TONIGHT AND THEN THEYRE OFF TOMORROW.
FIRST TIME OFF ON JULY 4th SINCE 1941.
GIANTS PLUS 120.
YOU CAN BOOK IT.
DOUG GIANTS BATS HAVE BEEN HOT IN SAN DIEGO.
WE HAVE PRESTON IN VEGAS.
PICKING A SUMMER LEAGUE GAME.
GRIZZLIESGIANTS MARLINS.
JOE IN THE BAY AREA TAKING THE GIANTS.
YOU GOING TO THE TRISTATE AREA FOR YOURS?
STEVE DARN RIGHT.
THE ALL MIGHTY YANKEES.
FIRST TIME SINCE 2013.
THATS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
DOUG NO SIR.
STEVE BACK ON THE MOUND FORT YANKEES.
TAKE THE YANKEES.
DOUG HE IS THROWING WELL LATELY.
YOURE STICKING TO THE HOME TEAM SO TO SPEAK.
IM GOING WITH MY TEAM AND WHERE IM GOING TO BE THIS HOLIDAY WEEKEND.
IM GOING WITH THE DODGERS.
LOOK I GOT LUCKY LAST NIGHT.
FIRST ONE  STEVE LUCKY?
DOUG BEYOND LUCKY.
STEVE I DONT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.
NEVER AGAIN.
DOUG IN AN EIGHTSTART STRETCH AN E.R.A.
OF EIGHT STARTS.
THEN GOT TOUCHED UP THE LAST ONE.
THAT WAS AT COORS FIELD.
COORS FIELD.
DODGERS ARE HOT.
AMAZING HOME RECORD.
FIVE STRAIGHT WALKS WERE GOING TO NEED TO COVER ITS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE WERE GOING TO HOPE NOT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH.
WE NEED BREATHING ROOM BUT I DONT THINK THAT BUELLER IS GOING TO GIVE UP MUCH.
I THINK THIS ONE GETS AWAY FROM THE DBACKS.
WHO KNOWS?
LOCKER ROOM DEMORALIZED AFTER THAT?
BULLPEN CERTAINLY IS SHAKY.
ILL LAY THE ONE AND A HALF.
I COULDNT FIND ANY OBSCENE MONEY LINES AND PARLAY WITH THE DODGERS STRAIGHT UP.
I WILL JUST LAY THE RUN AND A HALF AND TRY TO STAY HOT THIS WEEK.
STEVE LAYING THE 1.38 AS WELL.
ALL OF US PLAYING TO OUR HOME TEAMS.
I LOVE IT.
JOE PLUS MONEY WITH THE GIANTS AND THE GRIZZLIES FOR PRESTON OUT THERE.
I LOVE IT SCOUTING FOR PRESTON.
STEVE I KNOW.
DOUG GOLD CUP SEMIFINALS TONIGHT.
MENS SOCCER FOR THE AMERICANS AS THEY FACE JAMAICA.
REMEMBER THEY MET LAST GOLD CUP FINAL IN 2017.
21 VICTORY FOR THE AMERICANS.
THREEWAY BETTING.
U.S. IS 190 MINUS 1.90 TO WIN IN REGULATION.
THE DRAW PLUS 2.75 AND JAMAICA A HUGE UNDERDOG WITH THE OVERUNDER AT 2.50 AND THE UNDER IS MINUS 1 .90.
FOR MORE LETS GO OUT TO NASHVILLE AHEAD OF TONIGHTS GAME AND BRING IN ESPNFC REPORTER JEFF CARLISLE.
JEFF APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME.
U.S.
FAVORITE AS YOU WELL KNOW BUT LETS GO BACK ABOUT A MONTH AGO WHERE THEY LOST A FRIENDLY TO JAMAICA HOW DOES THE TEAM TONIGHT COMPARE TO THE ONE THAT LOST THAT GAME?
WELL ITS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT TEAM TO TAKE THE FIELD FOR THE UNITED STATES TONIGHT.
I COUNT AT LEAST SEVEN DIFFERENT PLAYERS THAT WILL BE IN THE STARTING LINEUP.
POSSIBLY EIGHT.
THOSE ARE KEY PLAYERS AS WELL.
KEY ATTACKING PLAYERS WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CHRISTIAN WESLEY McKINNEY.
THE FORWARD WILL BE JOSIE ALTADORE.
NONE OF THE PLAYERS PLAYED IN THAT GAME.
THEN YOU HAVE THE GUY KIND OF PROVIDING THE SHIELD IN FRONT OF THE DEFENSE.
MICHAEL BRADLEY.
HE IS GOING TO BE A KEY PLAYER FOR THE U.S. TONIGHT.
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY VERY WELL BE VERY MOBILE AND SO OBVIOUSLY ITS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT TEAM FOR THE U.S. TO TAKE THE FIELD.
CONTRAST THAT WITH JAM ACHE WHY.
THEY HAVE SEVEN PLAYERS THAT TOOK THE FIELD IN THE QUARTERFINAL AGAINST PANAMA THAT WERE ALSO ON THE FIELD THAT NIGHT IN WASHINGTON D.C.
WHEN THEY PLAYED THAT FRIENDLY AGAINST THE U.S. JAMAICA IS GOING TO HAVE A FEW NEW FACES.
THE U.S. WILL HAVE A LOT OF NEW FACES.
DOUG THE OVERUNDER IS TWO AND A HALF.
HOW MUCH SCORING DO YOU EXPECT?
I DONT EXPECT A WHOET LOCAL OF SCORING TONIGHT.
JAMAICA HAS ONLY CONCEDED TWO GOALS IN THE ENTIRE TOURNAMENT.
THE UNITED STATES HAS KEPT A CLEAN SHEET IN EVERY ONE OF THEIR GOLD CUP GAMES.
THEIR DEFENSE HAS BEEN VERY STOUT.
THE BACK LINE HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT.
THEYVE BEEN TESTED.
I MEAN THE QUARTERFINALS WITH COURASAO.
THEY HAD GOOD CHANCES AS WELL AND JACKS GOAL HAS BEEN VERY VERY GOOD.
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE ANDRE BLAKE.
HE PLAYS FOR THE PHILADELPHIA UNION.
HE IS ALSO VERY GOOD AND CAME UM UP BIG A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THAT QUARTERFINAL WIN OVER PANAMA.
I DONT EXPECT A WHOLE LOT OF SCORING TONIGHT.
I EXPECT IT TO BE A TIGHT SEMIFINAL LIKE LAST NIGHT WITH MEXICO AND HAITI.
AGAIN TWO AND A HALF GOALS SEEMS LIKE A LOT TO ME.
I EXPECT IT TO BE A 1 0 AFFAIR FOR SURE.
DOUG IN FAVOR OF WHO?
THE UNITED STATES.
I WOULD AGREE THAT THE UNITED STATES ARE SLIGHT FAVORITES BUT AGAIN JAMAICA HAS PLAYED THEM VERY TOUGH AND JAMAICA HAS GONE DEEP IN THIS TOURNAMENT YOU KNOW THE LAST TWO EDITIONS.
THEYVE MADE THE FINALS TWO TIMES.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOLD CUP JAMAICA IS A DIFFICULT TEAM TO BREAK DOWN.
I SEE THE U.S. GETTING THROUGH TONIGHT.
DOUG SOUNDS GOOD.

everyone loved each other and was always... Thats a great wish Jimmy.
Get a Bacon Double stack with a quarter pound of fresh beef nuggets fries and a drink for just five bucks.
Wendys Biggie Bag is everything you could wish for.
Coach!
Its kinda hard to see the ball.
Ive been there.
I had a TV service with hardly any sports in 4K.
Couldnt see any of the quality details.
I switched to DIRECTV now I get the most live sports in 4K.
So how does that help me?
It really doesnt.
I dont know why I told you that.
Go get em sport!
i Live sports that arent in 4Ki i are just kinda TV.i i Dont just kinda TV.
DIRECTVi have 4K?
Calli i 1.855.WATCH.4K and ask for iti i today.i DODOUG TIME FOR DAILY DIAMOND DOG AND THE BEST PART IS THE DOG WE GET TO FEATURE.
THIS IS BAXTER WHO IS A SERVICE DOG HERE AT ESPN.
WORKS WITH OUR AUDIO ENGINEER TYLER.
YOU REQUEST SEE BAXTER CERTAINLY IN CHARGE AND HE IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR HITTING THE BLEEP BUTTON WHENEVER I LOSE A BET ON SET.
BAXTER IS PROFILED AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIGGEST UNDERDOGS OF THE NIGHT AND THE BIGGEST ONE IS ACTUALLY A HOME TEAM.
THE BLUE JAYS IN TORONTO FACING CHRIS SALE AND THE RED SOX.
DBACKS ABOVE 200 ON THE COMEBACK FACING THE DODGERS AND WALKER BUELLER AS I NOTED EARLIER AND THE MARLINS DID CLOSE AROUND PLUS 240 AGAINST THE NATS BUT FIRST PITCH ALREADY UNDERWAY AT 605.
JOE BACK WITH ME.
WHATS YOUR DIAMOND DOG TONIGHT JOE?
ALL RIGHT DOUG.
LIMITED OPTIONS TONIGHT AND THERE IS NO WAY I WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE WALKER BUELLER TRAIN.
WERE GOING TO FADE CHRIS SALE AND THE RED SOX.
GIVE ME TORONTO PLUS CHRIS SALE BROKE FROM THE GATE IN SLUGGISH FASHION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERING WHAT WENT WRONG.
SETTLE DOWN.
IT WAS OUTSTANDING.
AS OF LATE A BILL IFFY.
NOT TERRIBLE BUT IFFY.
THE LAST THREE STARTS HE HAS GIVEN UP TEN EARNED RUNS OVER 17 INNINGED PITCHED.
AGAIN NOT TERRIBLE BUT MAYBE THERES SOMETHING THERE WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IN THIS SITUATION.
ONE OF THOSE STARTS WAS AT FENWAY AGAINST TORONTO.
GAVE UP A FEW RUNS.
DIDNT EXACTLY WORK THAT DEEP INTO THE GAME.
THIS MAY BE A SPOT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CHRIS SALE WHO BY THE WAY THIS IS THE WORST HARDHIT PERCENTAGE OF HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
HIS FAST BALL IS DOWN ABOUT A FULL MILE AN HOUR OVER HIS RESULTS FROM LAST SEASON.
NOT THE GUY WE SAW LAST SEASON.
STILL A VERY GOOD PITCHER.
BOSTON HAS LOST FIVE OF EIGHT SO THIS COULD BE A NICE LITTLE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO BACK THE DOG AT PLUS DOUG I CANT FAULT YOU THERE GIVEN THE PRICE ON THE DOG.
IM GOING TO GO WITH THE ROYALS PLUS 145.
A LITTLE BIT OF A  GOING HIGHER.
IN TWO STARTS SINCE RETURNING FROM INJURY MIKE LEVINGER HAS ALLOWED 12 RUNS.
SURE LOOKS LIKE HE RETURNED TOO QUIBBLE ARE FROM THAT BACK INJURY.
SOMETHING DOESNT SEEM RIGHT.
ILL TAKE THE ROYALS AT HOME PLUS THE JUICE THERE.
BY THE WAY IF YOU WANT TO SEND IN YOUR DOG WE WILL PROFILE HIM EVERY TIME WE HAVE THIS SEGMENT.
TWEET MEDOUG ESPN.

HE HAS THE BODY OF A  AND THE EATING HABITS OF HOMER SIMPSON.
HE IS NOT BOOKMARKED.
IF YOU ASKED HIM TO NAME A COUNTRY IN CENTRAL AMERICA HE WILL SAY KANSAS?
THE DIFFICULTY IN HIS MARRIAGE BEGAN AFTER HE NAMED HIS CHILDREN MILD MEDIUM AND HOT.

DECAF.
DIE.
OUR NEXT SCENERY IS AT DECAF.
IT IS AN HONOR TO ALL THOSE NEW LIVING TO BEHOLD THIS MAN.
HE IS THE CENTER OF OUR NATION ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIF IZIBLE HE IS CHAMPION.
JOEY CHESTNUT!
DOUG WE ARE NOW PLEASED TO WELCOME IN THE VOICE AND THE BIGGEST PERSONALITY OF THE JULY 4th HOT DOG EATING CONTEST GEORGE SHAY.
GEORGE THANKS SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME.
LETS GET INTO IT.
JOEY CHESTNUT.
HE IS A RECORD 11 MUSTARD BELTS.
IS THERE ANY CHANCE HE DOES NOT WIN THIS EVENT?
OH I THINK THERES ABSOLUTELY A CHANCE HE DOESNT WIN BUT I THINK THE ODDS WOULD BE EXTREMELY LOW.
NOT ONLY IS HE DOMINANT IN THIS SPORT.
74 HOT DOGS AND BUNS LAST YEAR IN TEN MINUTES.
ON TOP OF THAT I SAW HIM TODAY.
HE LOOKS ABSOLUTELY IN TOP FORM.
HE IS VERY TRIM VERY FIT.
HE IS VERY HEALTHY AND REST AND CONFIDENT.
I THINK HE IS GOING TO BE COMING IN STRONG BUT AT ANY TIME HE COULD BE BEATEN AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF GUYS.
JEFF AND MATT COULD TAKE HIM DOWN.
DOUG TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE TWO KIND OF CONTENDERS IF YOU WILL.
WHAT MAKES THEM  WHATS THE PATH TO THEIR SUCCESS AND BEATING JOEY CHESTNUT?
WELL BOTH OF THEM HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY AND JEFFREY ESPER HAD BEATEN JOEY CHESTNUT IF IM CORRECT TWO TIMES IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
HE GOT HIM IN HOSTESS AND HE GOT HIM IN CHICKEN WINGS.
HE IS A MONSTER.
RELATIVE ROOKIE.
SECOND THIRD YEAR ON THE CIRCUIT.
I THINK HE GETS A LITTLE BIT OF THE JITTERS GOING INTO THE BIG CONTEST ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.
HE ATE 51 HOT DOGS TO QUALIFY.
KEEP IN MIND THE QUALIFYING HOT DOGS ARE HARDER TO EAT.
YOU REALLY HAVE TO THINK OF HIM UP AT A 60 MARK OR SO.
THEN THERES ALSO MATT STONY.
HE IS REALLY AN INTERNET STAR NOW.
A YOUTUBE STAR.
DOUG A COUPLE OF THINGS TO DIGEST.
FORGIVE THE PUN.
QUALIFYING HOT DOGS ARE HARDER TO EAT.
WHY IS THAT?
WELL IF YOU THINK OF IT YOU ARE AT NATHANS THE MECCA OF HOT DOGS AND THEYRE COOKED PERFECTLY COOKED ON THE GRITLE AND THEYRE COOKED TO COME OFF A FEW MINUTES PRIOR TO THE CONTEST.
THEYRE THE PERFECT TEMPERATURE.
THEYRE WARM.
THEYRE NOT COLD OR HOT.
WHEN YOU ARE OUT THE CIRCUIT YOU MIGHT BE AT A BALLPARK.
THEYRE BRINGING THE HOT DOGS IN IN WARMERS.
THEYVE BEEN COOKED A HALF AN HOUR AN HOUR BEFORE.
SOMETIMES THEYRE NOT FULLY GRITLED.
THEYRE JUST COOKED OR THEYRE STEAMED BUT NOT GRILLED AS THEY WOULD BE AT CONEY ISLAND AND AS A RESULT THEYRE MORE DIFFICULT TO EAT.
OR IT TAKES LONGER TO EAT THOSE DOGS.
FASCINATING STUFF.
CHESTNUT EIGHT ATE 72 HOT DOGS.
DO YOU SEE HIM GOING PAST THAT MARK AS WELL THIS YEAR?
I ABSOLUTELY THINK HE WILL BE AROUND THERE.
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THINGS DROP OFF.
IT COULD BE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DAY.
IT COULD BE LITERALLY THE HUMIDITY.
ACTUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A VERY VERY DRY DAY IT CAN DRY OUT THE BUNS SO EVEN IF THEYRE ONLY OUT THERE FOR FIVE OR TEN MINUTES THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT CONSISTENCY.
THE HOT DOGS CAN TIGHTEN UP MORE.
THE TEMPERATURE COULD PLAY A ROLE.
DOUG MICKEY GOING FOR A SIXTH STRAIGHT MUSTARD BELT.
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES IN YOUR EYES SHE DOES NOT MAKE IT SIX STRAIGHT?
I THINK THEYRE LOW.
THE CHANCES THAT SHE DOES NOT WIN.
YOU KNOW SHE THERE COULD BE MORE VARIABILITY IN HER PERFORMANCE ON THAT.
DUG THE WHOLE SPECTACLE IS AWESOME.
I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCH IT ON JULY 4th.
IT WAS AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE.
IM LOOKING FORWARD TO WATCHING YOUR PERFORMANCE AS WELL.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME?
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
DOUG AND ON THAT NOTE WE GO TO PROP CULTURE TO WRAP UP THE SHOW.
JOE JOINS ME NOW.
JOE LOOK TOTAL OF HOT DOGS ON THE MENS DIVISION 73 12 AND THIS IS INTERESTING.
I LOVE WHAT EMMY GEORGE SHAY JUST SAID ABOUT MATT STONY WHO HE IS HEARING GRUMBLINGS THAT HE IS GOING TO REALLY BRING IT THIS YEAR AND ENORMOUS CAPACITY.
I HAVE BEEN TRACKING THIS STUFF FOR A LONG TIME WHEN I WORKED IN LAS VEGAS.
I GOT TO DO A LIVE SHOT DOWNTOWN WITH THE ONE AND ONLY JOEY CHESTNUT AND THE ONE AND ONLY KOBAYASHI.
THEY WERE TALKING TRASH TO ONE ANOTHER.
A LOT OF FUN.
IM NO EXPERT BUT IM STAYING UNDER 73 12 IF I HAD TO JOE.
JOE SHADES OF DAVIS FROST AND RICHARD NIXON NO DOUBT.
NOW IM GOING OVER 73 12 HOT DOGS AND I GOT JOEY CHESTNUT WINNING THIS THING.
JOEY CHESTNUT LIVES HERE IN THE BAY AREA WHERE I LIVE.
THE LAND OF KALE.
AVOCADO TOAST SODA TAXES.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT HAVING A CHEESEBURGER THEY WANT TO CAST YOU OUT.
BEAUTIFUL AREA NO DOUBT BUT THEY ARE NOT TOO FOND OF NASHING 73 12 HOT DOGS IN TEN MINUTES.
THATS NOT HOW PEOPLE DO THINGS HERE AND YET JOEY CHESTNUT RISES EVERY DAY IN THE FACE OF THAT ADVERSITY AND HE TAKES ON HIS DETRACTORS.
LETS GO BACK TO 20 IS A WHEN HE LOST TO MATT STONY.
62 TO 60.
CAME BACK THE NEXT YEAR TO SET A RECORD WITH 70 HOT DOGS.
CAME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO SET A RECORD WITH 72 HOT DOGS AND THEN CAME BACK LAST YEAR TO SET ANOTHER RECORD WITH 74 HOT DOGS.
THIS GUY IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT HIS COMPETITION.
HE IS WORRIED ABOUT HISTORY AND HE HAS STATED THAT HIS GOAL IS TO KNOCK DOWN 80 HOT DOGS IN A SINGLE SITTING.
DOUG I THINK TO YOU GOD BLESS JOEY CHESTNUT.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
DOUG AND WEATHER ON YOUR SIDE JOE.
ITS GOING TO BE A HUMID DAY AND GEORGE SHAY WAS JUST SAYING THAT THAT LENDS ITSELF TO THE OVER BECAUSE THE BUNS WONT DRY OUT.
THEN I DIDNT THINK OF ASKING HIM A LOT OF THE COMPETITORS DIP THE BUN IN THE WATER SO IM A LITTLE CONFUSED.
I HAVE CERTAIN THRESHOLDS FOR EXPERTISE ON THE HOT DOG EATING CONTEST.
I DO KNOW THAT I WILL BE WATCHING AND THIS ISNT LIKE THOSE OTHER SPORTS LIKE FOOTBALL  THEY ONLY WATCHED THE LAST FEW MINUTES.
YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF GEORGE SHAY AND ALL THE INTRODUCTIONS AND THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE AS WELL.
JOE WE APPRECIATE IT.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE ROOTING FOR HERE.
YOUR HOMETOWN GUY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY AND ENJOY YOUR HOLIDAY MY FRIEND.
AND RECAPPING OUR BEST BETS PRESTON THE VEGAS GRIZZLIES MINUS JOE ON THE UNDERDOG GIANTS PLUS 1.20.
