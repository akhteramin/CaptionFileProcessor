HE JUSSIE'S REPS SAID CHICAGO PD FIND HIS STORY CONSISTENT AND CREDIBLE.

THIS COME HAS DAY AFTER A SPOKESPERSON SAID THE KNOWN RECORDS DO NOT MEET THE BURDEN FOR A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HAS THEY WERE LIMITED AND HEAVILY REACTED.
JUSSIE'S REPS CLAIM INFORMATION WAS REMOVED TO PROVENT OTHERS WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ATTACK.
CHECK OUT THIS TEASER.
AT ANY POINT DURING THE ATTACK DID YOU FEAR FOR YOUR ATTACK?
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING IT.

IT'S NOT OUR JOB TO CREATE A NARRATIVE.
IF HE HAS OVERSTATED IT, I'M STILL WORRIED.

IT'S NOT OUR BUSINESS.
