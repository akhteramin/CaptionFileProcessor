CALIFORNIA BRACING WITH A SECOND EARTHQUAKE STRIKING, FOUNDATIONS OF ROADS CRACKING, AND NOW THE FEAR ANOTHER ONE COULD BE COMING AS CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARES A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY.
WELCOME, HAPPY WEEKEND, I AM NEO AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WHERE ALL IS CALM AFTER RIDGECREST CALIFORNIA WHERE THE FIRST EPICENTER, 
THAT IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND JEFF IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL.
HOW ARE THINGS THERE NOW?
Reporter: THERE'S A GENERAL FEELING OF UNEASINESS, 
TWO DAYS, TWO BIG MASSIVE EARTHQUAKES NEAR THIS TOWN IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS LATEST ONE, 
SEVERAL AFTERSHOCKS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OR SO WHEN WE WERE WAITING TO SPEAK WITH YOU, WE FELT SEVERAL OF THEM AT CITY HALL 
AND THAT UNEASINESS IS LEADING MANY PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO LEAP -SLEEP INSIDE THEIR HOUSE LASTLY.
WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTY GOING STREET TO STREET TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WERE OKAY.
HE SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE OR COMING HERE TO CITY HALL WHERE THERE IS A SHELTER SET UP.
MAYBE WE COULD PULL UP THE ACTUAL SOUND ON THIS. THIS IS THE MOMENT WE WERE AT A RESTAURANT, 
STARTED TO FEEL THE RUMBLING, THE VIOLENT SHAKING AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT. TAKE A LISTEN.
YOU COULD REALLC IN PEOPLE'S VOICES.
THIS WAS A RESTAURANT RIGHT HERE IN RIDGECREST AND T WAS A SLIGHT AFTERSHOCK BEFORE THIS AND EVERY ONE, THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A FEW IN THE LAST DAY 
BUT THE 7.1 THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS SHAKING, DISHES CRASHING ON THE GROUND AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE IN DISBELIEF, SOME HITTING THE GROUND IN TEARS 
AND SHORTLY AFTER WALKING OUT OF THIS RESTAURANT WE LOOKED INTO THE DISTANCE AND WE SEE A HUGE PLUME OF SMOKE, 
WE GET CLOSER AND REALIZE THIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE AND THIS IS AT LEAST ONE HOUSE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE, 
A LOT OF THESE FRTED BECAUSE OF RUPTURED GAS LINES.
WE ARE ONLY HEARING OF SOME MINOR INJURIES, AND THINGS FALLING ON PEOPLE, REPORTS OF ANY DEPTH BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY, HAS REQUESTED A PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION, HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
SO FAR THE PRESIDENT HASN'T TWEETED ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA.
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM HAS DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR AT LEAST SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND BRACING FOR MORE.
THAT HAS EVERYONE ON TENTERHOOKS. WHAT KIND OF MORE DOES THAT MEAN? HOW MUCH MORE?
