"A.M. JOY", LIVE FROM NEW ORLEANS. WELL, THIS WEEK ON AMERICA'S BIRTHDAY, KNOWN AS INDEPENDENCE DAY OR SIMPLY JULY 4, DONALD TRUMP THREW HIMSELF A PARTY.
EVER SINCE HE SAW THAT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT HAS A PARADE, IT'S CALLED BASTILLE DAY AND THE DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA HAS A PARADE, IT'S CALLED AUTHORITARIANISM, AND THAT THEY GET TO HAVE TANKS AND PEOPLE MARCHING IN FRONT OF THEM AND SALUTING THEM, AND ALL OF THAT STUFF, HE'S WANTED TO HAVE ONE TOO.
HE TRIED TO CO-OP OTHER HOLIDAYS LIKE VETERANS DAY AND MEMORIAL DAY, BUT THE ADULTS IN THE MILITARY KEPT PUSHING HIM BACK.
NO MORE.
DONALD TRUMP FINALLY GOT HIS SPECIAL DONALD TRUMP PARADE,
ROLLING TANKS DOWN THE STREETS OF YOUR CAPITAL, FLYING AIR FORCE PLANES OVER HIS HEAD WHILE HE GAVE AN ODD SPEECH ABOUT THE AIRPORTS, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS TOOK CONTROL OF DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR?
IN JUNE OF 1775, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS CREATED A UNIFIED ARMY OUT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES ENCAMPED AROUND BOSTON AND NEW YORK. AND NAMED AFTER THE GREAT GEORGE WASHINGTON COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
THE CONTINENTAL ARMY SUFFERED A BITTER WINTER OF VALLEY FORGE, FOUND GLORY ACROSS THE WATERS OF THE DELAWARE, AND SEIZED VICTORY FROM CORN WALLACE OF YORK TOWN.
IT RAN THE RAMPARTS IT TOOK OVER THE AIRPORTS, IT DID EVERYTHING IT HAD TO DO AND AT FORT McHENDRY UNDER THE ROCKETS RED GLARE, IT HAD NOTHING BUT VICTORY.
OKAY.
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY BECAUSE YOU PAID ATTENTION IN SCHOOL BUT JUST SO THAT IT'S SAID, THE CONTINENTAL ARMY WAS NOT NAMED AFTER GEORGE WASHINGTON.
THERE WAS NO AIR TRAVEL DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
AIRPLANES WEREN'T EVEN INVENTED UNTIL 1903,
AND THE BATTLE AT FORT McHENDRY HAPPENED DURING THE WAR OF 1812.
DETAILS.
IN THE END, FOR MILLIONS OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS, THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP GOT.
ON THIS DAY, 243 YEARS AGO, OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PLEDGED THEIR LIVES, THEIR FORTUNES AND THEIR SACRED HONOR TO DECLARE INDEPENDENCE AND DEFEND OUR GOD GIVEN RIGHTS.
NOT AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT BUT WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN AUTHORITARIAN LEADER,
FESTOONED BY HIS MILITARY AND MAKING A SHOW OF FORCE TO, WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR WHO
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY REALLY LIKES DICTATORS.
JOINING ME NOW IS PRESIDENT O AND CEO OF LATINO.
CRAIG UNGER, VANITY FAIR CONTRIBUTOR, AND AUTHOR OF HOUSE OF TRUMP, HOUSE OF PUTIN, AND REPRESENTATIVE TED LOU, DEMOCRAT FROM CALIFORNIA, AND A MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEES.
I WANT TO GO TO YOU FIRST, CONGRESSMAN,
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT,
WATCHING AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT DO THIS THING THAT TOM NICHOLS, WHO IS A SOVIET, EXPERT ON THE HISTORY OF THE SOVIET UNION AND OF THAT REGION, DESCRIBED AS LOOKING LIKE AN OLD SOVIET KIND OF, YOU KNOW, PARADE.
THANK YOU, JOY FOR YOUR QUESTION.
LET ME JUST FIRST SAY THAT NATURAL DISASTER LIKE EARTHQUAKES CAN STRIKE AT ANY TIME AND I URGE TO BE PREPARED WITH SUPPLIES AND A SAFETY PLAN.
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH TRUMP'S JULY 4th EVENT IS IT WAS A CAMPAIGN EVENT PAID FOR BY THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER.
NOT ONLY DID HE DIVERT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THIS EVENT, HE HAD THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE GIVE OUT PASSES, VIP PASSES TO MAJOR DONORS.
THAT WAS OUTRAGEOUS.
A VIOLATION OF OUR ETHICS AND HE MADE A MOCKERY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY.
THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR STATE.
WE JUST SAW TWO NATURAL DISASTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
SO THIS IS A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY HAS PRIORITIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MONEY ON,
THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT STATES ARE READY FOR NATURAL DISASTER LIKE YOU JUST SAW IN YOUR STATE.
WHEN YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DIVERTING MONEY SO HE CAN HAVE PLANES FLY OVER HIM, RATHER THAN SPENDING THE MONEY ON IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THAT, OR MAYBE UNCAGING CHILDREN, WHICH HE'S ALSO DOING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA AND OTHER PLACES,
AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT THAT.
THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A TREMENDOUS WASTE OF MONEY.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CAN'T USE OFFICIAL RESOURCES TO PARTICIPATE IN A PARADE.
IN THIS CASE, TRUMP DIVERTS $2.5 MILLION OF NATIONAL PARK FEES TO PAY FOR HIS PARTY,
AND I'VE ASKED THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THIS BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS TAXPAYER MONEY DO THIS EVENT AND HAVE THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE BE INVOLVED HANDING OUT VIP PASSES TO THE MAJOR DONORS.
YEAH, AND BESIDES THAT, I WANT TO GO TO YOU CRAIG UNGER,
YOU HAVE WRITTEN A LOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HIS MAFIA SORT OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT HE HAS HAD THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO RUSSIA.
THIS IS WHAT MICHAEL McFALL, THE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA TWEETED AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S WEIRD PARADE.
HE SAID I KNEW THIS WAS COMING,
TWEET FROM JULIA DAVIS NEWS, RUSSIA STATE TV IS OBSESSIVELY BASHING TRUMP'S LOW ENERGY WEAK PARADE WITH RUSTY TANKS,
THE HOSTS LOL AT TRUMP'S CLAIM'S,
THERE'S YOUR CITY UPON A HILL,
A WORLD LEADER AND MARTIANS HAVE BEEN DEFEATED.
DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY WASTED AMERICA'S MONEY TO MAKE HIMSELF A CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL BUT ALSO HAS SUBJECTED THE UNITED STATES TO MOCKERY BECAUSE REAL DICTATORSHIPS KNOW WHAT A DICTATOR PARADE IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE, CRAIG.
AT LEAST SOMETIMES THEY GET THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT,
AND I MEAN, IT'S INTERESTING THAT IF THE RUSSIAN STATE TV IS GOING AFTER TRUMP, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S SAY SO.
IT'S ALSO INTERESTING, THE CLIP YOU SHOWED, THE NUMBER OF HISTORICAL ERRORS IN IT IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY, AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS AN OFFICE OF SPEECH WRITING WITH LOTS OF RESEARCHERS AND INTERNS AND THEY FACT CHECK THINGS,
AND THERE ARE ONLY THREE POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT LEVEL OF STUPIDITY TO TAKE PLACE.
ONE IS THAT THAT OFFICE IS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH PEOPLE WITH ROOM TEMPERATURE IQ,
THE OTHER IS THAT ALL THE PROCEDURES HAVE FALLEN APART, AND THEY DON'T EXIST ANYMORE,
AND THE THIRD POSSIBILITY IS IT'S SPRAYING FROM THE BRAIN OF DONALD TRUMP, AND THAT IS DEEPLY, DEEPLY DISTURBING.
YEAH, THERE'S A LOT ABOUT IT THAT'S DISTURBING LONNIE,
I'M GOING TO GO TO YOU ON THIS, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE TO HAVE A HISTORICAL CONTEXT.
DONALD TRUMP ADMIRES DICTATOR SHIPS AROUND THE WORLD.
ALL OF THE MEDIA IS HIS VERSION BASTILLE DAY CEREMONY.
I POINTED OUT EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE WHOLE BASTILLE DAY THING IS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE TO DICTATORS.
THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE BASTILLE DAY IS ABOUT.
THAT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT THIS IS. DONALD TRUMP LIKES DICTATORS.

WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT YOU THINK CAME OUT OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID THIS WEEK?
IT WAS GRANDIOSITY AND SELF-INFLATION,
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS, I THINK, THAT'S SIGNIFICANT HERE IS THAT THE UNITED STATES, AT LEAST IN THEORY, IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE ON THE DOCTRINE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS, THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, AND THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL AUTHORITY.
THAT IS A DIFFERENT POSITION, FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT POSITION THAN A STATE IN WHICH THE PERSONALITY OR THE AUTHORITARIAN LEADER IS THE HEAD OF ALL INTEREST AND IDEAS WITHIN THE STATE,
AND SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS ESSENTIALLY HIJACK THIS IDEA AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GLORIFY ITSELF.
IT'S AN INTERESTING PARADOX HERE, WHICH IS THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I DID A FULL BRIGHT FELLOWSHIP AND SPENT AN ENTIRE SEMESTER IN MOSCOW, TEACHING AT MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY AND AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER, THERE WAS THE MAY 9th CELEBRATION.
ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN TO RUSSIA OR KNOWS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT THEIR HISTORY POST WORLD WAR II, MAY 9th IS A GIGANTIC CELEBRATION THAT HAPPENS EACH YEAR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE FOURTH OF JULY AND NEW YEAR'S AND IT IS A RECOGNITION OF THE SOVIET DEFEAT NAZI THREAT, AN THREAT IN WORLD WAR II.
IT'S HUGE. I WAS THERE FOR THE PARADE AND THERE'S THIS COMPLETE PROCESSION OF MILITARY VEHICLES.
THEIR MISSILES, TANKS, ARMORED VEHICLES, THEIR JEEPS AND IT LOOKS LIKE AN ARMY AMASSING FOR AN INVASION.
SOMEONE TURNS TO ME AND SAYS DO YOU DO THE SAME THING IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.
I SAID, NO, THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THEY, IN THE UNITED STATES BELIEVER THERE SHOULD BE A REALLY CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN CIVILIAN AUTHORITY AND MILITARY MIGHT AND THAT OUR AUTHORITY IS SUPPOSED TO, AT LEAST IN THEORY, STEM FROM OUR LAWS AND OUR MORAL BELIEVES.
AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS ESSENTIALLY INVERT THAT TO CREATE IT AS THE KIND OF SATIRICAL, ALMOST, EMULATION OF SOMETHING THAT HE SEES IN VLADIMIR PUTIN,
WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS AS THE ANTIDEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS.
YEAH, I MEAN, THAT IS AN EXCELLENT POINT.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT TRUMP TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK BIG FROM THIS PIECE.
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING THAT INDEPENDENCE MEANT NOTHING MORE THAN A MADE FOR TELEVISION EVENT AND AN EGO MESSAGE.
IT INVOKED MOCKERY.
THERE'S A CARTOON THAT'S DRAWN ON WHAT AIRPLANES WOULD LOOK LIKE DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
IT'S BEN FRANKLIN ATTACHED TO TWO KITES AND THIS IS BY SOMEBODY I KNOW,
THE GREAT NATALIE JOHNSON WHO DREW THAT.
HERE'S THE REALITY, DONALD TRUMP IT SEEMS WANTS TO BE SEEN AS THIS BIG MAN,
RIGHT, HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS THIS GRAND LEADER OF THIS GREAT MILITARY BUT WHAT HE ACTUALLY CAN ACCOMPLISH THROUGH HIS OWN, YOU KNOW, THE QUALITY OF THE STAFF THAT HE HAS AROUND HIM IS HE CAN'T DO THAT.

THE REALITY IS EVEN IN THE CASE OF RUSSIA, WHICH NOW IS AN ADVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES, DURING WORLD WAR II, THEY WERE FIGHTING THE NAZIS.
IF THEY'RE DOING A BIG CELEBRATION, TALKING ABOUT DEFEATING THE NAZI EMPIRE, THEY'RE SENDING A MESSAGE AGAIN TO DICTATORS.
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PARADES,
THAT AND ONE IN NORTH KOREA.
TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO IT. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW.
OR REALLY WHY.

WE ARE THE LARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE WORLD.
WE DON'T HAVE TO SHOW THAT TYPE OF DISPLAY OF FORCE BECAUSE THE WORLD ALREADY KNOWS IT
AND WHAT I FOUND SO DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT CAME TO JULY 4th IS JULY 4th IS TO COMMEMORATE OUR ROOTS AS AMERICANS,
THE FACT THAT WE FLED DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HERE, AND RECOGNIZE THAT,
OUR DNA IS WE'RE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE HAVE STRENGTH AND DON'T HAVE TO SHOW MILITARY MIGHT BECAUSE THE WORLD KNOWS IT,
AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS A SAD DISPLAY. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO JOIN THE MILITARY WHEN HIS CARD WAS UP.
HE DEFERRED IT ON BONE SPURS
AND BASICALLY NOT ONLY DETERIORATES THE FLAG BUT ALSO THE MEANING OF WHAT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN AND JULY 4th AND COME TOGETHER AS A NATION.
THE REASONS PRESIDENTS DON'T MAKE IT ABOUT THEM IS BECAUSE IT'S ONE COUNTRY, UNDER ONE FLAG IN UNISON.
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PARTISAN.
HE CREATED A CAMPAIGN RALLY, TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE US AND DIVIDE US. WHAT I THINK IS BEAUTIFUL IS YOU SAW FAMILIES ON THE LAWN SAYING I'M APOLITICAL AND I'M HERE TO SHARE IT WITH FAMILIES.
WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE.
WHO WE ARE, AND WE KNOW WE DO IT WITH JUSTICE.
THE FACT THAT HE CAN DO THIS IN THE BACKDROP OF CAGING CHILDREN, THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AND THE MORE WE CAN STAND STRONG TO VALUES, DESPITE THE OPERATION IN OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CLEAR MINDED ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN AND FAIR AND JUST.
DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT YOU SAW, DONALD TRUMP MADE US LOOK STRONGER AND WEAKER AS A COUNTRY.
ABSOLUTELY WEAKER.
THE WORST PART OF IT IS THAT HAD THIS NOT BEEN AN INEPT DISPLAY OF PSEUDO AUTHORITARIANISM, WE STILL WOULD HAVE LOOKED WEAKER.
IF HE HAD DOWN THIS CORRECTLY, IN AIR QUOTES CORRECTLY, WE WOULD HAVE LOOKED WEAKER.
NOW WE LOOK DOUBLY WEAKER, BECAUSE IT'S A POOR IMITATION OF WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

WHEN THE RUSSIANS LOOK AT US, THEY ARE LAUGHING AT US.

IS HE A SUBJECT OF MOCKERY TO THEM.
I THINK HE IS SUBJECT TO MOCKERY,
THE IMAGES THAT COME AWAY IS WE HAVE CONCENTRATION CAMPS ON THE BORDER, TANKS BY THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
THERE WAS AN PIECE TO THE "WASHINGTON POST,"
THE ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT RECONCILIATION,
IT'S ABOUT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL, OUR ORIGINAL SIN WAS SLAVERY. THE CIVIL WAR, AND THIS IS WHERE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE RECONCILIATION, AND INSTEAD TODAY WE HAVE IMAGES OF TANKS AND THE WHOLE CRISIS AT THE BORDER.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD, CONGRESSMAN.

AS A PERSON WHO DID SERVE, UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHEN YOU SAW TANKS ROLLING DOWN THE NATION'S CAPITOL, YOUR THOUGHTS WERE WHAT?
HAVING SERVED IN THE ACTIVE DUTY IN THE MILITARY, WE HAVE BEEN TRAINED NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN PARTISAN CAMPAIGN EVENTS.
THERE'S A DIRECTIVE THAT PROHIBITS MILITARY MEMBERS FROM SHOWING UP IN UNIFORM AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY.
THIS WAS A MASSIVE TAX FUNDED CAMPAIGN RALLY, HANDING OUT VIP PASSES,
IT ERODED WHAT SHOULD BE A NONPARTISAN MILITARY AND THAT WAS SAD AND DISAPPOINTING.
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND SENDING OUT GOOD THOUGHTS TO YOUR STATE CONGRESSMAN, JILANI COBB, CRAIG UNGER,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
