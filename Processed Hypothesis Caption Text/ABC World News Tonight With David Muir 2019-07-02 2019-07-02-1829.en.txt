Reporter THE 19YEAR COMBAT VETERAN WAS ACCUSED OF WAR CRIMES DURING A 2017 TOUR IN IRAQ INCLUDING MURDERING THIS TEENAGE ISIS PRISONER SEEN WOUNDED IN THIS IRAQI TV VIDEO.
FELLOW S.E.A.L.
COREY SCOTT GRANTED IMMUNITY TESTIFIED THAT HE SAW GALLAGHER A MEDIC STAB THAT TEEN IN THE NECK.
BUT IN A SHOCKING TWIST SCOTT TESTIFIED THAT HE NOT GALLAGHER KILLED THE BETTEEN BY PLUGGING HIS AIRWAY TO PREVENT HIM FROM BEING TORTURED BY IRAQI FORCES SAYING I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DIE ANYWAY.
GALLAGHERS DEFENSE TEAM ARGUED DURING THE TWOWEEK TRIAL THAT THE CASE WAS BUILT ON FALSE ACCUSATIONS FROM DISGRUNTLED SAILORS.
THIS IS NOT A MURDER THIS IS A MUTINY.
THIS IS A GROUP OF YOUNG DISGRUNTLED SAILORS THAT DIDNT LIKE BEING TOLD THAT THEY WERE COWARDS.
AND SO THEY DECIDED TO CONSPIRE TO TAKE DOWN THE CHIEF.
AND CLAYTON SANDELL JOINS US NOW LIVE.
CLAYTON WE KNOW THAT EDWARD GALLAGHER WAS CONVICTED OF THAT ONE CHARGE POSING FOR A PICTURE OF A CAPTIVES DEAD BODY.
SO COULD HE STILL FACE PRISON TIME?
Reporter THATS RIGHT CECILIA.
PROSECUTORS SHOWED THOSE PICTURES DURING THE TRIAL.
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARGUE THAT THE SENTENCE FOR THAT CRIME WOULD BE LESS THAN THE TIME HES ALREADY SERVED SO THEY BELIEVE GALLAGHER WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT.
CECILIA?
