 WE WILL TIMEOUT HOUR BY HOUR WHEN SNOW COMES IN AND WHEN IT TURNS TO SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN.
JUST A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
CHILDREN OH SO SCARRED BY THIS CRIME.
DO YOU THINK BRYCE HARPER IS COMING BACK.
PART OF ME SAYS NO AND PART YES.
GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.
I SAT DOWN WITH NOTED SCHOLAR AND JESUIT PRIEST FATHER THOMAS READ EARLIER FOR AN CONVERSATION ABOUT SEX ABUSE IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
FIRST WE NEED TO BRING YOU UP TODATE ON THE WEATHER.
A RED WEATHER ALERTs BEE SNOWFALL TOTALS A LITTLE BIT DOESNT DIMINISH THE IMPACT OF THE STORM.
THIS HAS ELEMENTS THAT ARE DANGEROUS WITH SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN.
GAITHERSBURG WURZBURG WURZBURG  HAGERSTOWN TO THE MOUNTAINS 1 THREE IMMEDIATE METRO D.C. CHEVY CHASE BETHESDA AND SOUTH.
NOT AS MUCH.
TRACED TO AN INCH.
COLD AIR LACKING A BIT.
THE ROAD IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER TO GET INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.
RPM UP TO ITS OLD TRICKS AGAIN 7 INCHES EVERYONE ELSE HAS A GRASP ON REALITY 2 3 INCHES.
WE KNOW THAT SNOWFALL WILL BE MODERATE TO HEAVY 600 A.M. TO NOON AND ROADS WILL BECOME TREACHEROUS AND WHEN IT STARTS IT WILL PICK UP IN INTENSITY QUICKLY AND ACCUMULATE QUICKLY.
SNOW WILL GO TO A MIX NORTHWEST IN THE AFTERNOON AND RAIN D.C. SELF IN EAST IN THE AFTERNOON.
IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THE DAY IT WILL TURN ALL RAIN MIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT AFTER MORNING SHOWERS ON THURSDAY.
LOOK HOW MUCH MOISTURE IS HEADED OUR WAY.
IF THE SYSTEM WERE 300 MILES OFF TO THE EAST COULD BE LOOKING AT A BLIZZARD BUT WE ARE NOT.
500 A.M. A LITTLE SNOW BREAKING OUT PARTS OF THE METRO TEMPS UPPER 20s LOW 30s BECOMES HEAVY TO MODERATE ACROSS THE ENTIRE METRO BY 700 ON WEDNESDAY.
TEMPS 2930 DEGREES.
1000 HEAVY SNOW ACROSS THE METRO AND IT BEGINS TO MIX AND CHANGE AROUND THE LUNCH HOUR.
WHEN WE COME BACK WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH ICE WILL ACCUMULATE AND WHO IS MOST MOST LIKELY TO HAVE A POWER OUTAGE.
IF MANNY MACHADO IS GETTING 300 MILLION WHAT WILL BRYCE HARPER GET?
MACHADO HAS AGREED TO SIGN WITH THE SAN DIEGO PADRES REPORTEDLY WORTH 300 MILLION OVER TEN YEARS.
THE DEAL PENDING RESULTS OF THE PHYSICAL.
THE FORMER BALTIMORE OREO SAID THE L.A. DODGERS INFIELDER IS SET TO PLAY 3rd BASE.
NOW THE ATTENTION TURNS TO BRYCE HARPER.
SPECULATION ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA.
WILL HE RESIGN WITH THE NATIONALS?
MOST DONT THINK SO.
LATEST RUMORS HAVING GOING TO PHILADELPHIA.
THE PLAYERS ALREADY IN SPRING TRAINING CAMP IN FLORIDA.
BUT DARREN HAYNES SAT DOWN WITH DAVEY MARTINEZ TO TALK ABOUT IT Reporter HOW MUCH YOU WANT PRICE ON YOUR TEAM?
GREECE AND I HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
WHO WOULDNT WANT BRYCE HARPER ON YOUR TEAM?
HONESTLY?
ONE OF THE BEST YOUNG PLAYERS IN THE GAME.
AND FOR ME ITS ALL ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS.
FOR HIS FAMILY AND HIS CAREER.
IT REALLY IS.
HES GOT BIG DECISIONS TO MAKE.
I WOULD BE WRONG TO SAY THAT OF COURSE ANYBODY WOULD WANT HIM ON HIS TEAM.
IF BRYCE DECIDED IM COMING BACK TO THE NATIONALS WHAT WOULD BE YOUR REACTION IF HE WALKED IN THE DOOR?
WELCOME BACK.
THATS IT?
TIME TO WORK.
GO TO WORK.
DO YOU THINK BRYCE HARPER IS GOING BACK?
PART OF ME SAYS NO PART OF YES.
THE WAY THIS GAME IS YOU DONT KNOW.
YOU REALLY DONT KNOW.
Reporter WHICH WAY ARE YOU LEANING?
HONESTLY LIKE I SAID I CANT LEAN EITHER WAY.
IT IS SO WEIRD BECAUSE YOU KNOW?
LIKE I SAID I TRIED TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS WHAT IVE GOT TO DO TODAY.
LEAD 59 GUYS TOMORROW MORNING GET UP AT 600  GET TO THE BALLPARK AND GET THE DAY GOING.
MY FOCUS IS ON THE DAY AT HAND THE HERE AND NOW AND THAT IS WHAT IM WORRIED ABOUT.
EAT YOUR FOOD MAN.
IS MARTINEZ PLAYING US?
HOW DOES HE NOT KNOW?
I DONT KNOW IF HE DOES.
I THINK THERE IS A BIG QUESTION MARK IT.
MANNY MACHADO JUST SIGNED FOR THE LARGEST FREEAGENT DEAL IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN SPORTS SUCH AS BASEBALL.
THERE IS BIG PRESSURE ON BRYCES AGENT TO GO AT LEAST 1 DOLLAR OVER THAT.
THE NATIONALS HAVE OFFERED 300 MILLION.
I DONT KNOW IF THE OFFER IS THERE ANYMORE.
WHAT DAVEY MARTINEZ IS THINKING AS TED LERNER BROKE HIS PENDENCY WITH SCOTT MORRISON ONLY HAS A BUNCH OF CLIENTS BEFORE CAN HE SAY NO TO HIM THIS TIME?
I THINK THATS GOING TO BE THE QUESTION.
PERSONALLY I WANT BRYCE TO STAY.
HE IS STAR POWER.
RELAX STARS.
WITH JERSEYS ON THE BACK THAT SORT OF THING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
MY GUT IS THE PHILLIES WILL OFFER SOMETHING SO ENORMOUS ONE PERSON SAID NINE YEARS 367 MILLION I DONT KNOW IF THAT WILL HAPPEN OR NOT.
I KNOW THAT THE NATIONALS WILL BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO COUNTER.
I JUST CANT.
BASED ON PAYROLL BASED ON WHAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED ALREADY BUT I DONT KNOW.
THAT COULD BE A WILDCARD.
THE NATS HAVE SOMEONE IN BRYCES POSITION RIGHT NOW.
DOES THAT MATTER?
ROBLES SOTO DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE HIS SPOT AT THE PLAY.
THEY ARE GOING TO BE BRYCE HARPER.
BRYCE HARPER WAS A LIVE WIRE A HAND GRENADE.
YOU DIDNT KNOW WHEN HE WOULD EXPLODE.
THE MOST EXCITING THING IN SPORTS.
THEY ALREADY BRING THOUSANDS OF FANS HERE EVERY TIME THEY PLAY.
PHILLIES FANS ARE THE WORST.
I LOVE YOU I KNOW YOU I WORKED YOU BUT PHILLIES FANS OF THE WORST.
THE SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDAL THAT HAS SHAKEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AT ITS CORE.
FOR US IT STARTS HERE IN WASHINGTON D.C. FOR FORMER CARDINAL AND ARCHBISHOP THEODORE DID PETER MCCARRICK HAS BEEN DEFROCKED BY THE POPE LIVING IN A REMOTE MONASTERY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDWEST.
THEY ARE REPORTING CHILDREN WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED FOR YEARS BY PRIESTS WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN CARING FOR THEM.
YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT POPE FRANCIS HAS CALLED THE SUMMIT.
WE ARE TALKING WITH A NOTED JESUIT PRIEST AND SCHOLAR.
TELL ME WHY YOU WERE GOING TO ROME RIGHT NOW?
I AM GOING TO ROME BECAUSE THE POPE HAS CALLED A MEETING OF TOP BISHOPS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO COME AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT THE SEX ABUSE CRISIS.
HE WANTS TO EMPHASIZE TO THEM HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK HE IS GOING TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IF THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE HE WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
THIS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT MEETING FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BECAUSE THE FIRST MEETINGS LIKE THIS THAT IS EVER HAPPENED.
LETS TALK ABOUT THE HEADLINES.
JUST TODAY THE WASHINGTON POST IS REPORTING THAT DEAF CHILDREN WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED BY PRIESTS IN ARGENTINA.
IS THIS GOING TO COME UP IN ROME?
THIS IS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
CHILDREN ARE SO SCARRED BY THIS CRIME THIS ABUSE THAT THEY SUFFER UNDER.
THAT IS WHY THE CHURCH HAS TO HAVE A POLICY TO DEAL WITH IT.
UNITED STATES WE HAVE 0 POLICY ON ABUSE OF CHILDREN.
IN THE CHURCH WE HAD THIS POLICY OF ZEROTOLERANCE SO ANY PRIEST INVOLVED IN ABUSED IS REMOVED FROM THE PRIESTHOOD.
THE SECOND PART IS TO MAKE SURE ALL BISHOPS IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY.
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE AT THIS MEETING.
TALK TO ME ABOUT THE APPARENT HYPOCRISY IN ALL THIS.
IT HAS COME OUT TODAY IN A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE THAT THE VATICAN HAS A BOOK HAS RULES ON WHAT TO DO WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE BOTHERED BY PRIESTS?
WHO KNEW?
ACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT AND REPORTS I HAVE SEEN THE EMPHASIS ON THE PRIESTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS CHILD.
POPE FRANCIS SAID THIS IN THE PAST HE SAID IT BEFORE HE BECAME POPE AND THAT IS IF A PRIEST FATHERS A CHILD THAN HE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY AS A FATHER  FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUST AS A FATHER THE PATERNAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT RESPONSIBILITY PRECEDES HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO BE A PRIEST.
HE SHOULD LEAVE THE PRIESTHOOD AND RAISE THE CHILD.
COMING UP MY CONVERSATION CONTINUES.
Z35WDZ Z16FZ Y35WDY Y16FY THE POPE HAS SUMMONED CHURCH LEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO MEET AT THE VATICAN.
WILL THEY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PRIESTS?
LETS CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH FATHER THOMAS READ.
THIS PART OF THE CONNECTION WASNT AS CLEAR BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF PRIESTS?
I WAS IN THE SEMINARY 100 YEARS AGO 13 GUYS IN MY CLASS ONLY ONE BECAME A PRIEST.
I KNOW THAT JOHN WAS.
WE HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG THERE ARE PRIESTS.
IF IT WERE UP TO A LOT OF CATHOLICS THERE WOULD BE OPENLY PRIESTS THERE WOULD BE WOMEN MARRIED PRIESTS WHO COULD HAVE CHILDREN.
WHEN IS THE CHURCH GOING TO COME TO THIS OR IS THIS WISHFUL THINKING?
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF WONDERFUL PRIESTS IN THE PRIESTHOOD.
PRIESTS WHO OBSERVE THEIR VOW OF CELIBACY AND ARE VERY GOOD PASTORAL PRIESTS.
WE DONT WANT TO MIX UP THE ISSUE OF PRIESTS WITH THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ABUSE.
OF MINORS.
AND THAT CHECKPOINT NEEDS TO BE MADE.
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK WE NEED FOR HONESTY IN THE CHURCH.
FOR EXAMPLE THE U.S. BISHOPS HAVE NEVER LOVED ANYBODY TO SURVEY PRIESTS TO FIND OUT WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE.
WE HAVE ESTIMATES FROM TEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.
NOBODY HAS ANY REAL DATA.
THE ONE FACT WE DO KNOW IF THERE ARE PRIESTS MOST OF THEM ARE GOOD PRIESTS WHO OBSERVE THEIR PROMISE OF CELIBACY AND ARE GOOD FOR THE CHURCH.
DO YOU EXPECT ANYTHING TO COME OF THIS MEETING OR IS THIS GOING TO BE MORE WINDOWDRESSING?
I THINK MOST AMERICANS ARE GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS MEETING BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SET UP STRUCTURES TO HOLD BISHOPS ACCOUNTABLE.
I THINK THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THIS MEETING IS PRIMARILY FOR OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE BISHOPS ARE IN TOTAL DENIAL.
THEY DONT THINK THEY HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
THEY THINK THIS IS AN AMERICAN PROBLEM.
IN THE MESSAGE WE WANT TO TAKE IS DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES THE AMERICAN BISHOPS DID.
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.
MOVED THE BAD PRIESTS AND HELP THE VICTIMS IN HEALING.
IT IS NOT JUST THE PRIESTS.
WERE SEEING THEATER MCCARRICK RIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON WHO HAS BECOME THE POSTER CHILD FOR THIS KIND OF ABUSE.
NOT JUST PRIESTS THE BISHOPS ARE BEING ASKED TO POLICE THEMSELVES ARE THEY NOT?
NO I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
AND NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH HE WAS A RETIRED BISHOP THEY BROUGHT THE INFORMATION TO THE VATICAN AND THE VATICAN SAID OKAY TREAT HIM JUST LIKE YOU WOULD A PRIEST OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK.
HIS CASE WAS INVESTIGATED THEY HIRED A FORENSIC RESEARCH TEAM THE INFORMATION PRESENTED AND THE ACCUSATIONS WERE CREDIBLE SUBSTANTIATED AND HE WAS REMOVED REFINED A NOW REMOVED FROM THE PRIESTHOOD.
HE IS NO LONGER BISHOP MCCARRICK IS MR. MCCARRICK.
HE WILL NEVER BE A PRIEST AGAIN.
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN.
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR TRIP WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING REPORTS.
THANK YOU.
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
WASHINGTONS CURRENT ARCHBISHOP IS OBVIOUSLY LEAVING.
WE DONT HAVE ANY WORD TONIGHT.
IF YOU MISSED PART ONE OF OUR INTERVIEW BOTH WILL BE POSTED ON WUSA9.COM AFTER THIS BROADCAST.
IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION .
MAKE SURE TO CHECK IT OUT.
COMING UP A RED WEATHER ALERT FOR TOMORROW THE LATEST TIMELINE ON LOOKING FOR A RED WEATHER ALERT FOR SNOW AND SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN.
HERE IS A LOOK AT THE SNOWFALL MAP.
3 5 LEESBURG GAITHERSBURG OR FREDERICKSBURG.
IN THE METRO 1 3 LOWER THAN YESTERDAY.
IS TAKING MORE SLEEP.
LET US KNOW INTO SOUTHERN MARYLAND TRACE TO AN INCH THERE.
NOTICE THE PLUS SIGN SOME OF YOU COULD GET CONCEIVABLY OVER 5 INCHES WHICH IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.
WORRIED ABOUT THAT ONE BACK TO THIS THE SECOND.
WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH SOME THINGS TO GET TO SUNDAY.
GFS EUROPEAN MODEL PRETTY MUCH IN AGREEMENT WITH US AROUND 3 INCHES.
SEEMS REASONABLE.
FROM WICHITA KANSAS TO CAPE HATTERAS SNOW EXTENDING UP IN THE IOWA AND SOUTH DAKOTA AND NEBRASKA I RESERVE THESE FOR SNOW BECAUSE IF IT IS LEGITIMATE ON THE FRONT AND IN TERMS OF IMPACT WE KNOW ITS COMING HOPEFULLY FOLKS WILL STAY OFF THE ROAD BUT NONETHELESS STILL GIVE IT 3.5 IN THE IMPACT AS WELL.
CERTAINLY A LEGITIMATE STORM.
I HAVE UPDATED THIS ON OUR WEBSITE.
IN TERMS OF POWER OUTAGES ISOLATED ALONG I95 AND POINTS WEST UNLIKELY EAST AND SCATTERED OUT IN CUMBERLAND HAGERSTOWN.
EVEN WHERE ICING WILL OCCUR 3 INCHES OF SNOW IN D.C. PLAIN OLDFASHIONED RAIN WILL ADD TO THE WEIGHT OF THE SNOW AND COULD BRING DOWN THOSE AS WELL.
MACY POWER OUTAGES NOT CONFINED TO JUST AREAS WITH ICE.
THIS IS ONE MODEL MOST EYES FOR THE WEST AND NOT THAT BAD.
GAITHERSBURG THREE TENTHS AND CAN PROBABLY HANDLE IT.
NOW ALMOST AN INCH THREE TENTHS LEESBURG GAITHERSBURG THAT WOULD CAUSE POWER OUTAGES.
WE START OUT WITH PEERS SNOW.
BUT THIS COLUMN OF AIR IS BELOW FREEZING.
THAN WE GET WARM AIR AS IT MOVES IN TO THE ATMOSPHERE BECOME SLEET.
FREEZING RAIN IS WHAT WE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT  FALLS LIQUID BUT FREEZES ON CONTACT.
WE ADJUSTED THE TIME A BIT.
HEAVY SNOW 600 A.M. TO NOON.
ROADS WILL BECOME DANGEROUS.
THEY BECOME INTENSE QUICKLY AND ACCUMULATE QUICKLY.
WE WILL GO TO MIX NORTH AND WEST IN THE AFTERNOON.
RAIN D.C. SOUTH AND EAST IN THE AFTERNOON.
HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT AND SHOWERS IN THE 50s ON THURSDAY.
600 A.M.
TOMORROW SNOW ACROSS MOST OF THE METRO.
THE DARK OF THE BLUE HEAVIER SNOW.
900 NO DOUBT BUT IT BEGINS TO TURN AS WE GET TOWARDS THE LUNCH HOUR ESPECIALLY DOWN TO THE SOUTH PLAIN OLD RAIN D.C. SOUTH AND EAST BY 300.
SOME LINGERING FREEZING RAIN NORTH AND WEST UNTIL THE EVENING.
HERE WE GO RED ALERT WEDNESDAY 56 MORNING SHOWERS THURSDAY AND NICE ON FRIDAY.
IN TERMS OF SNOW ONCE AGAIN LOOKING AT 3 5 NORTH AND WEST AND 1 3 IN THE METRO AND TREES TO AN INCH THE CAUSE OF THE WINTER WEATHER THE WASHINGTON TEAM WILL BE ON EARLY TOMORROW WITH THE LATEST ON CONDITIONS AND CLOSINGS.
