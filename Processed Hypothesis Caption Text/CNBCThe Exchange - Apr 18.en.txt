THIS IS THE BIG THING THAT COULD CHANGE SENTIMENT

ALUMINA TWITTER MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS,


MSI GOOD STUFF,

THANKS, EVERYBODY.
GOOD HOLIDAY
AS WELL THE EXCHANGE STARTS NOW.

D.C. AND YOUR MONEY,
POLITICIANS IN AMERICA, WILL DEBATE THE MEANING OF THE MUELLER REPORT, WE ASK COULD IT LEAD TO EVEN MORE GRIDLOCK AND STANDSTILL IN D.C.

PING AND CONFERENCING, ZOOM AND PINTEREST HITTING THE MARKET TO A LOT OF INVESTOR FANFARE. COULD THEY SUFFER THE SAME NATURE AS LYFT SHAREHOLDERS,
A FOLD FAIR, A RECYCLEABLE SHOE, AND A NEW LEGAL SMOKING AGE.
THAT'S WHAT'S AHEAD ON RAPID FIRE,
IT'S A BIG LEAGUE SHOW LET'S START WITH
DON CHIAO THE DOW IS UP
ALMOST 100 POINT THE. AND STABLE RIGHT NOW FOR THE MOST PART.
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE MARKETS OVERALL, MIXED ONLY BECAUSE THE NASDAQ IS LAGGING.
THE S&P 500 UP BY ABOUT 3 POINTS AND THE DOW INDUSTRIALS JUST ABOUT 100 POINTS TO THE UPSIDE,
THAT'S PRETTY DECENT OVERALL, WE'LL SEE IF THAT STICKS,
ONE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY GROUP TO FOCUS ON
THE I SHARES TRACKS THE DOW TRANSPORTS, RIGHT NOW AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS WE'VE SEEN GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO DECEMBER THIRD. SO TRANSPORT IS A BIG PART OF THAT STORY.
UNION PACIFIC EARNINGS BETTER THAN EXPECTED. THAT'S DRIVING THE TRADE THERE, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ONE OF THE STOCKS OF THE DAY THAT'S NOT ZOOM, THAT'S NOT PINTEREST CHECK OUT BLACKSTONE,
LOOK AT THIS 8 1/2% GAINS,
A PRIVATELY TRADED PARTNERSHIP THAT'S GOING TO BE A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION.
A LOT MORE INVESTORS COULD COME IN THE MIX, AND THEY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY FOR THEIR FUNDS LAST YEAR, BACK OVER TO YOU MUCH.
SIDEWALK BOX, TALKING THAT UP THIS MORNING
SO -AND THE MARKETS THAT DOM JUST WALKED YOU THROUGH HAVE TWO NEW MEMBERS TO WELCOME INTO THE FOLD TODAY YOU'VE HEARD THE NAMES, PINTEREST AND ZOOM ARE BOTH PUBLIC BOTH RISING.
JUST ADDING TO THE LIST OF NAMES, INCLUDING SOME VERY UNDER THE RADAR ONES
THAT HAVE DONE VERY WELL WHEN THEY HIT THE TAPE
BOB PA SANI IS AT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE WITH MORE WHAT A DAY
BOTH OF THEM,
NOT ONLY -THE FLOOD GATES HAVE REALLY OPENED NOT OWN BE DO THEY RAISE THE TERMS GOING INTO IT, THEY POPPED AT THE OPEN AS WELL,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE,
PINTEREST
PRICE TALK WAS 15 TO 17. THEY PRICED IT AT 19 IT OPENED AT 23.75, AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT ON INTRADAY TRADING HERE THEY'RE GOING TO TRADE THE WHOLE FLOW TODAY,
IT'S HOLDING UP VERY WELL, UP 24.35
ZOOM, THOUGH, 28 TO 32,
JUST FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 28 TO 32 FOR ZOOM.
PRICED AT 36, THAT'S NOT A TYPO,
IT OPENED AT $65
THIS IS VERY RARE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT OPENS TWICE AS HIGH AS ANYBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD A WEEK AGO, YOU SEE IT TRADING RIGHT HERE AT $63. JUST OFF THAT NUMBER
IT'S PROFITABLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT,
IT'S GOT 100% GROWTH, AND THOSE ARE THE TWO MAGIC WORDS WE GOT
RECENT IPO'S THAT JOINS A PARADE, THEY'VE DONE REALLY WELL
LEVI STRAUSS ALL DOING GREAT,
LYFT IS IT ONE OF THE FEW COMPANIES STILL TO THE DOWN SIDE,
NO COMPANIES NEXT WEEK, BRIAN, BUT THE WEEK AFTER, WE'LL GET ANOTHER SLEW, MAYBE I HEART MEDIA, MAYBE NEXT FRIDAY WE'LL GET UBER GIVING US SOME TERMS,
WE'LL SEE, NOT SURE ABOUT THAT YET.
BOB PA SANI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW,
TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE THE OTHER BIG THING TO HIT THE TAPE TODAY WAS THE MUELLER REPORT
IT'S PERHAPS MORE HEAVILY REDACTED THAN MANY HAD THOUGHT OR HOPED BUT AT 400 OR SO PAGES LONG, OUR TEAM IS STILL POURING THROUGH IT MANY
EAMON JAVERS STILL TRYING TO DIGEST THAT




THE HEADLINE IS OUT THERE, THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN SAYING THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION,
THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE.
INSIDE THE DOCUMENT, WE'RE FINDING SOME OF THE AREAS OF CONCERN FOR ROBERT MUELLER, PARTICULARLY AROUND THE AREA OF POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE JUSTICE, AND THE PRESIDENT'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HIS TWEETS EVEN ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE SITUATION, THOSE WERE RED FLAGS FOR ROBERT MUELLER IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
PARTICULARLY ON THIS IDEA OF --
ALL RIGHT, SO WHEN WE GET EAMON BACK UP, SOMEONE PULLED THE PLUG LITERALLY ON EAMON.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE MARKETS AND POLICY GOING-FORWARD.

LET'S BRING IN LIBBY CANTRELL HEAD OF PIMCO.
