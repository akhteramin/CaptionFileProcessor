 PEOPLE.
WELL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION MANY TIMES IN THE WEEKS TO COME.
OTHERWISE HAVE A HAPPY FOURTH.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
RIGHT BACK AT YA.
READ THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
REMEMBER WHAT THE FOURTH OF JULY IS ABOUT AND THE VALUES WE WANT TO UPHOLD.
I THINK THE SAME THING.
WE SHOULD NOT BE POLITICIZING TOMORROW FOURTH OF JULY.
ITS A DAY OF INDEPENDENCE ITS KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND REMEMBERING WHO WE ARE.
WE CELEBRATE THE FOURTH OF JULY IN THE MIDST OF A SERIOUS MORAL CRISIS.
WHERE WILL WE BE WHO ARE WE?
THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE WILL BE THE QUOTE SHOW OF A LIFETIME IN WASHINGTON.
CHRIS JANSEN PICKS UP THE SHOW RIGHT NOW.
GOOD MORNING.
IM CHRIS JANSEN IN FOR ALEX WITT.
PHOTOS THAT SHOW SQUALID CONDITIONS AT MIGRANT CENTERS AND ITS EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD THAN WE KNEW.
THESE SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS SITUATIONS DETAILED FROM OUR OWN INSPECTOR GENERAL AFTER SURPRISE VISITS TO MULTIPLE FACILITIES.
THOSE PHOTOS REVEALED NO HOT MEALS NO ABILITY TO SHOWER.
ADULTS GIVEN ONLY BOLOGNA SANDWICHES TO EAT CAUSING HEALTH PROBLEMS.
WHEN DETECTIVES SAW THEM THEY BANGED ON WINDOWS AND HELD UP SIGNS DESPERATE FOR RELEASE.
ONE OF THE SIGNS SAID HELP 40 DAYS HERE.
THAT WOULD VIOLATE A FEDERAL COURT ORDER THAT MIGRANTS BE HELD NO LONGER THAN 72 HOURS.
A SENIOR MANAGER DESCRIBED THE WHOLE SITUATION AS QUOTE A TICKING TIME BOMB.
OUR OWN JACOB SOBOROFF HAS SEEN SOME OF THESE BORDER FACILITIES WITH HIS OWN EYES BUT WOW THIS REPORT EVEN THOUGH WE KNEW SO MUCH IT WAS SHOCKING TO SEE IT ALL THERE IN ONE PLACE.
YOUR REACTION TO THIS NEW REPORT WHICH CITES IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS NOT AT ONE OR TWO BUT SEVEN DIFFERENT SITES.
YOU JUST READ WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE KEY PHRASE THAT THIS THING IS A TICKING TIME BOMB.
THIS IS NOT JUST A PHRASE THAT CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE CONDITIONS IN THOSE SEVEN FACILITIES IN THE RIO GRANDLY VALLEY.
THE FACILITY IVE BEEN INSIDE THAT CENTRAL PROCESSING STATION THERE IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY WHERE THEY SEPARATED MORE KIDS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER THE TICKING TIME BOMB CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE WAY THE BORDER HAS BEEN DETAINING MIGRANTS FOR DECADES.
THESE ARE PRISONS JAILS.
THEY TREAT MIGRANTS AS IF THEY ARE PRISONERS AS IF THEY ARE CRIMINALS COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY.
THEYVE ALWAYS BEEN SET UP AS INTAKEJAIL PROCESSING TYPE STATIONS WHERE NO ONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE LONGER THAN 72 HOURS AND IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY WOULD SEE A SURGE LIKE THEY DID AND ARE CIEGA LONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER TODAY.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND ARE BEING PLACED INTO TINY JAILLIKE FACILITIES THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR SINGLE ADULT MALES TO BE THERE DURING A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME.
ITS EXACTLY WHAT WERE SEEING IN THIS DHS REPORT ABOUT THE RMV SECTOR AND ITS WHATS BEEN GOING ON IN EL PASO JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
AND A WEEK AGO WAS WHEN THIS INSPECTION WAS DONE AND THE DHS SAID IT REQUIRED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND ACTION SO IT SOUNDS LIKE AT LEAST IN SOME INSTANCES THERE ARE NO MAJOR CHANGES IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS.
IS THAT YOUR READ?
THE CONDITIONS ARE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER QUICKLY IN THESE FACILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THATS DOWN THERE.
THATS THE CONVERSATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY AMONG THE DEMOCRATS.
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THE WAY THIS COUNTRY IS HOLDING MIGRANTS WHEN THEY COME INTO THIS COUNTRY?
BUT I WILL SAY IF THERE IS ANY BRIGHT SPOT IN ALL OF THIS JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE WERE OVER 2300 JULIA AINSLEY REPORTED THIS YESTERDAY 2300 CHILDREN IN BORDER PROTECTION IN FACILITIES JUST LIKE THIS.
AS OF YESTERDAY THERE WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED AND THEYVE BEEN MOVED TO FACILITIES THAT ARE OPERATED BY HHS IN OTHER AREAS NOT JUST AT THE SOUTHWEST BORDER BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
IT DOESNT MEAN THAT THE FACILITIES ARE GETTING ANY BETTER IT MEANS THAT THE CHILDREN FOR NOW HAVE BEEN MOVED OUT IN LARGE PART AT LEAST ACCORDING TO WHAT JULIA HAS LEARNED FROM CDP.
I THOUGHT AT ONE POINT A BABY WAS BEING HELD IN A PLACE THAT WAS REALLY COLD AND ACTUALLY THEIR HANDS AND FEET HAD TURNED BLUE.
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS HERE.
JAKE IF YOURE GOING TO STAY WITH ME I WANT TO BRING IN BUREAU CHIEF PHIL RUCKER AND FOUNDER OF STRATEGIES AND SKD KNICKERBOCKER.
SO PHIL WE SEE THE ADMINISTRATION CITING THESE ISSUES.
IS THERE ANY CHANGE HERE AT ALL?
NO.
RATHER THERE IS A FOCUS ON THE NUMBERS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CROSSING THE BORDER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING DETAINED.
WERE HEARING FROM OFFICIALS IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THOSE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DECLINING IN RECENT WEEKS FROM A HIGH IN MAY BUT WEVE NOT SEEN THE PRESIDENT REALLY FORCEFULLY TAKE CONTROL OF THIS ISSUE AND TALK ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT WE SEE PLAYING OUT THATS SO WELL DOCUMENTED IN THAT IG REPORT AND IN THE REPORTING FROM PEOPLE LIKE JACOB.
AND ITS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS RICK THAT IS UNFOLDING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION SEASON.
BUT EVEN DHS RESPONDED TO THIS REPORT BY SAYING CONGRESS FAILURE TO ACT IS INCENTIVIING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
BUT DO YOU BELIEVE ANYTHING WILL CHANGE BEFORE THE ELECTION OR HAS THIS ISSUE JUST BECOME TOO POLITICIZED?
I WOULD LIKE TO STEP BACK AND PUT IT IN CONTEXT.
THIS HAS OCCURRED OVER DECADES OF TIME AND BOTH PARTIES ARE TO BLAME AND I REALIZE THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION IS IN CHARGE NOW.
BUT LOOK I AGREE WITH CHAIRMAN NADLER THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
YES WE NEED TO WEED OUT THE BAD APPLES BUT IM GOING TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT DEMONIZING THE BORDER PATROL.
THE PROBLEM IS THESE FACILITIES THAT THE BORDER PATROL IS WORKING ARE NOT DESIGNED TO HOLD FAMILIES AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY CHILDREN FOR THE TIME THEYRE DOING IT.
SO I HAVE TO SAY THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF WE ARE ILLEQUIPPED TO TREAT IMMIGRANTS HUMANELY THEN I WOULD BE FOR  ITS NOT IF.
THEYRE NOT BEING TREATED HUMANELY.
THEYRE BEING TOLD TO DRINK OUT OF TOILETS KIDS ARE FREEZING.
HERES WHAT I WOULD SAY.
IF I WERE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS I WOULD BE SAYING WE NEED TO RELEASE THE MAJORITY OF THESE PEOPLE TODAY.
MAYBE PEOPLE WHO WERE KNOWN TO BE DANGEROUS WOULD STAY IN DETENTION BUT THE MAJORITY OF THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE RELEASED TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT TOLERATE A COUNTRY THAT WE ARE TREATING PEOPLE SO INHUMANELY.
WELL I MEAN WE HAVE 11 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT THAT ARE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BUT THAT IGNORES THE FACT THAT ULTIMATELY THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND IT IS THE PRESIDENT WHO PUT POLICIES IN PLACE THAT LED US TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
YEAH THIS REPORT IS ALARMING ITS SHOCKING.
A LOT OF THE IMAGES WEVE SEEN ARE ALARMING AND SHOCKING.
I THINK IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS HOW BIG OF A FAILURE THIS WHITE HOUSES IMMIGRATION POLICY IS.
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ITS NOT KEEPING US SAFER AND ITS INHUMANE.
I THINK WHAT WERE GOING TO SEE FROM DEMOCRATS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A HEARING NEXT WEEK IN THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WHERE THE CDP WILL COME AND TESTIFY.
DEMOCRATS HAVE ALSO REQUESTED HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR IMMIGRATION POLICIES.
AND THEYVE BEEN MET WITH NO.
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REFUSED TO TURN OVER THIS PAPERWORK.
WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION BLAMES CONGRESS THEYRE NOT COOPERATING WITH CONGRESS SO CONGRESS CAN HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION.
SO THE BUCK DEFINITELY STOPS WITH TRUMP AND THEYRE DEFINITELY DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STONEWALL HERE.
WE JUST GOT FROM TWITTER FROM THE ACTIVE INVESTIGATOR THAT HES POSTED BORDERED PATROL PERSONNEL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT FROM KEVIN McALEENAN IS GOOD BUT REMEMBER HE CALLED THESE CONDITIONS UNSUBSTANTIATED AS EARLY AS LAST FRIDAY.
WHEN YOU HEAR A CULTURE OF 9500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS IN A SECRET FACEBOOK GROUP THIS WAS FROM PRO PUBLICA TALKING IN THE WAY THAT THEY WERE ITS HARD NOT TO GIVE CREDENCE OF THE ALLEGATIONS WE HEAR COMING OUT OF THESE FACILITIES.
WEVE HEARD THE REPORTS FROM THE DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO WERE DOWN THERE EARLIER THIS WEEK.
IVE SEEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS DOWN THERE WITH MY OWN EYES.
AND AGAIN ITS A POSITIVE STEP I SUPPOSE BUT ITS CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO ALLEVIATE WHAT IS HAPPENING AS RICK SAID RIGHT NOW DOWN THERE.
AND WE JUST GOT A REPORT I GUESS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS OR SO JACOB THAT A YOUNG GIRL OR A TWOYEAROLD APPARENTLY DROWNED IN THE RIO GRANDE AFTER WE SAW THAT HEARTBREAKING PICTURE OF A FATHER AND HIS CHILD.
YEAH.
AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER HORRIFIC STORY OF A FAMILY WHO JUST WANTED TO ESCAPE THEIR LIVES WHERE THEY WERE TO COME FOR A BETTER LIFE.
THIS REPORTEDLY WAS A HAITIAN NATIONAL WITH A CHILD WHO WAS A BRAZILIAN NATIONAL CROSSING THE RIO GRANDE.
THEY WERE SEPARATED IN THE RIVER AND A SEARCH IS ONGOING RIGHT NOW BY THE BORDER PATROL.
IF IT TURNS OUT THIS CHILD DID NOT SURVIVE I WANT EVERYBODY TO REMEMBER THAT 7000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED TRYING TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY SINCE 1998.
THE FAILURES OF OUR BORDER POLICY AS AMERICANS HAVE BEEN SYSTEMIC LITERALLY FOR DECADES IN DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS.
NOBODY HAS TREATED MIGRANTS MORE INHUMANELY THAN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN FESTERING LITERALLY FOR DECADES AND NOW FINALLY AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED ITS REFRESHING ITS REASSURING TO HEAR ALL OF US DEBATING HOW WE FIX IT SO THIS DOES NOT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.
WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHO THE WE IS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY DOUBLING DOWN.
YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE DYING REPORTS OF ADULTS THAT ARE LITERALLY IN CELLS THAT ARE SO TIGHTLY PACKED THAT THEY CANT SIT DOWN.
STANDING ROOM ONLY FOR A WEEK AT A TIME.
AND YET HES SIGNALLING MORE DETENTIONS AFTER TOMORROW IMPOSING FINES ON UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS WHO DONT SHOW UP FOR COURT.
PHIL I WAS THINKING BACK TO WHEN THE FIRST LADY WENT DOWN AT THE TIME OF THE FAMILY SEPARATION AND SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THE FIRST LADY AND IVANKA WILL IMPRESS UPON HIM THE INHUMANITY OF WHATS HAPPENING DOWN THERE.
BUT IS THERE ANY SCENARIO THAT YOU SEE HAVING COVERED THIS PRESIDENT THAT SUGGESTS TO YOU THAT HE WILL SHY AWAY FROM THIS AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE?
NOT AT ALL CHRIS.
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR HIM.
POLITICALLY HE BELIEVES HIS TOUGH STANCE ON IMMIGRATION IS WHAT GOT HIM THE PRESIDENCY IN THE FIRST PLACE ITS WHAT HELPED HIM DEFEAT ALL THOSE REPUBLICAN CHALLENGERS IN THE 2016 PRIMARIES AND HE BELIEVES ITS WHATS GOING TO WIN HIM REELECTION.
ITS WHY YOU HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT IT AT EVERY SINGLE RALLY.
AND HIS ADVISERS SAY THEY HOPE THIS ISSUE STAYS IN THE HEADLINES FOR EVERY DAY BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY AND SO THE FIRST LADY CAN TRY TO PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE HUMANITARIAN ISSUE ALTHOUGH WEVE NOT SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING FROM HER IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HERE AND IVANKA TRUMP CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT BUT THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THIS IS HOW HE WINS REELECTION.
JACOB SOBOROFF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONTINUED REPORTING.
EVERYONE ELSE YOURE COMING BACK SO ILL SEE YOU SOON.
COMING UP ITS AN ALLOUT IOWA BLITZ.

 WERE NOW EXACTLY SEVEN MONTHS AWAY FROM THE IOWA CAUCUS AS DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE AWARE.
SEVEN OF THE CANDIDATES ARE BARNSTORMING THE STATE TODAY WHILE THE LATEST IOWA POLLS ARE RELEASED.
KAMALA HARRIS IS SURGING IN IOWA JUMPING INTO SECOND AND CLOSING IN ON FRONTRUNNER JOE BIDEN.
ELIZABETH WARREN ALSO GOT A POSTDATE BUMP WHILE PETE BUTTIGIEG IS THERE.
JOE BIDEN IS DROPPING NOT JUST IN IOWA BUT NATIONALLY.
IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT HIS CAMPAIGN IS SWITCHING STRATEGY?
THE STRATEGY WAS SLOWLY BUILDING THIS CAMPAIGN FROM THE GROUND UP AND OF COURSE HIS TEAM IS POINT TO GO AN ABC POLL THAT SHOWS HIS SUPPORT ACTUALLY INCREASING TICKING UP JUST A FEW POINTS.
HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER HAD A VIDEO BRIEFING FOR SUPPORTERS LAST NIGHT AND IN THAT BRIEFING HE SAID THERE WILL BE PEAKS AND VALLEYS BUT THEYRE GOING TO STAY THE COURSE.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TRIP TO IOWA THAT SENATOR SANDERS IS DOING YOU NOTICE A COUPLE SUBTLE SHIFTS IN HIS STRATEGY.
NUMBER ONE HIS FOCUS ON RETAIL POLITICS.
THERE WILL NOT BE AS MANY TRADITIONAL RALLIES THAT HE HAS.
HES HAVING ICE CREAM SOCIALS THOUGH.
AS YOU SAW LAST NIGHT HE STILL GIVES LONG SPEECHES AT THESE ICE CREAM SOCIALS BUT HES TRYING TO MAKE PARADES AND SHAKE HANDS ON THIS HOLIDAY.
THEY ARE OPENING THREE NEW OFFICES IN THE STATE OF IOWA.
THEYRE ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THEIR VOLUNTEER FORCE.
THEYRE SHOWING THEY HAVE THIS 40s THAT CAN DELIVER HIM TO VICTORY COME FEBRUARY 3rd AND COME THAT CAUCUS TIME.
THEYRE FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON THOSE RALLIES BUT ALSO ACTIVATING THE SUPPORTERS AND GETTING THEM OUT THERE AS MANY CANDIDATES ARE HERE AND FOCUSED ON GETTING THOSE IOWA VOTERS.
THE DEBATE HAS CATAPULTED KAMALA HARRIS WHO YOURE WITH IN SERIOUS CONTENTION.
BUT WE ALSO KNOW DEBATE BOUNCES CAN BE SHORTLIVED.
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY ADJUSTMENTS ON HER CAMPAIGN TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HER FUNDRAISING BECAUSE WE KNOW SHE MADE 2 MILLION IN 24 HOURS BUT WE HAVENT SEEN HER QUARTERLY NUMBERS.
Reporter YEAH WE HAVENT SEEN THE QUARTERLY NUMBERS YET.
THEY EXPECT TO RELEASE THOSE IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.
AFTER HER PERFORMANCE THE CAMPAIGN RAISED 3 MILLION JUST IN ONLINE DONATIONS.
SHE HAD MULTIPLE FUNDRAISING EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE SHE RAISED AN ADDITIONAL 6 MILLION THE CAMPAIGN TELLS US.
WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THIS CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW COMING OUT OF THE DEBATE?
THE REALITY RIGHT HERE IN IOWA IS THEY NOW HAVE 65 PAID STAFFERS HERE ON THE GROUND IN IOWA.
THEY LOOKED AT THAT DEBATE AS AN OPPORTUNITY AS BEING MORE THAN A DEBATE BUMP.
THEY BELIEVE THIS SUMMER IS THAT MOMENT WHEN PEOPLE WOULD START PAYING ATTENTION.
WE ARE AS OF NOW SEVEN DAYS AWAY FROM THAT IOWA CAUCUS.
I ASKED KAMALA HARRIS I WAS WITH HER IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE WEEKEND.
I ASKED HER ON SUNDAY HOW SHE LOOKED AT APPROACHING THIS CAMPAIGN GOING FORWARD AND WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE AN APPROACH OF PROSECUTING THE CASE AGAINST HER DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS.
SHE WAIVERED WITHOUT ANSWERING DIRECTLY AND I ASKED HER WOULD YOU ASK FOR COMMENT FROM YOUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS.
SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT SHELL BE HERE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
GARRETT A NUMBER OF OTHER CANDIDATES ARE THERE TODAY.
MONEY AND POLLS TWO BIG THINGS.
I DO ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING WHEN THE DEADLINE COMES SOME CANDIDATES USUALLY THE ONES THAT HAD A GREAT QUARTER GET OUT THERE AHEAD OF EVERYTHING AND THE REST LAG BEHIND.
ANY SUGGESTION ON WHEN WELL SEE SOME OF THESE OTHER NUMBERS AND WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR?
BETO OROURKE SEEMED TO SUGGEST YESTERDAY HE HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAD RAISED IN THAT LAST QUARTER.
Reporter YEAH I DONT BUY THAT FOR ONE SECOND CHRIS.
IM SURE THAT HE MAY NOT KNOW THE EXACT TOTAL BUT THESE CAMPAIGNS WATCH THEIR FUNDRAISING NUMBERS PROBABLY CLOSER THAN THEY WATCH THEIR POLLING NUMBERS.
THE CANDIDATE WOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEYRE ON TRACK TO HIT THEIR QUARTERLY GOALS OR NOT AT THE VERY LEAST.
A LOT OF THIS IS NEW CYCLE MANAGEMENT.
OROURKE YOULL REMEMBER IN THE FIRST QUARTER HIS CAMPAIGN WAITED AND HELD THE NUMBERS OVER THE WEEKEND.
I THINK IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK THAT HAPPENED ON A THURSDAY OR FRIDAY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.
THEY DECIDED NOT TO RELEASE THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDNT WANT IT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE WASH OR LOOK LIKE THEY WERE BRAGGING.
IF YOURE SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BRAG ABOUT YOUR FUNDRAISING NUMBERS TODAY IS THE LAST DAY TO DO THAT FOR A WHILE.
IF YOURE CAUGHT UP IN THIS HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BURY THEIR NUMBERS THEYRE DISAPPOINTING NOT WHAT YOU WANTED THEM TO BE GREAT TIME TO NOT RELEASE YOUR NUMBERS.
OROURKE IS HERE BIDEN IS HERE KLOBUCHAR IS HERE.
ILL BE COVERING A BUTTIGIEG EVENT LATER ON TONIGHT.
THE THING ABOUT IOWA IS ITS A PLACE YOU CAN GO TO MOVE YOUR POLLING NUMBERS WHY BEING ON THE GROUND MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
I CALL THESE THE SUPER VOTERS.
PARTICULARLY IN IOWA YOU MEET THESE FOLKS WHO TAKE THEIR ROLES SO SERIOUSLY.
LISTEN.
SIMPLY NAMING THEM ALL CAN BE A FEAT.
PETE BUTTIGIEG ELIZABETH WARREN AMY KLOBUCHAR.
BERNIE SANDERS JULIAN CASTRO AND INSLEE.
Reporter MEETING AND QUESTIONING THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IS A DUTY AND A PRIVILEGE.
HOW MANY OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HAVE YOU GONE TO SEE SO FAR?
I THINK BIDEN WILL BE 12.
Reporter 12?
YES.
Reporter VOTERS IN IOWA SEE MOST OF THE CANDIDATES WITH MORE THAN 150 EVENTS HELD IN THE STATE IN THE MONTH ALONE.
ILL TRAVEL TO WHEREVER WE HAVE TO GO YOU KNOW.
Reporter SOME SUPER VOTERS HAVE A CAUSE.
WHEN I STARTED IN 2016 I WAS SO ANGRY.
SHE LOST HER HUSBAND TO ALZHEIMERS.
SHES ASKED OPPONENTS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN FOR TWO MONTHS.
MY HOPE IS THEY WOULD PUT OUT A POLICY ABOUT ALZHEIMERS.
Reporter IN NEVADA THERE IS A GROUP CALLED MAKE THE ROAD.
I WANT TO BE AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE.
I DONT WANT TO BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD.
HE COMES TO THE RALLIES WITH A LIST OF QUESTIONS.
WHAT IS YOUR METHOD TO GET A CANDIDATE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?
TO CORNER THEM IF THERE IS A Q  A SESSION MY ARM GOES UP FASTER THAN ANYBODY ELSES.
IVE BEEN TRAINED WELL.
Reporter MARK CORVER HAS NO PROBLEM CATCHING A CANDIDATES EYE FOR A CHANCE TO GET A SIGNED BASEBALL.
ITS IMPORTANT TO GET PERSONALIZED YOURSELF BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK PRESIDENTS ARE LARGER THAN LIFE.
THIS BRINGS OUT THE MORE HUMAN SIDE.
Reporter FOR ALL THESE SUPER VOTERS PICKING PRESIDENTS IS A PARTICIPATORY SPORT.
WATCHING THE DEBATE ISNT ENOUGH.
THEY WANT TO SHAPE IT.
IM ONE OF MANY VOICES BUT IF I HAVE A VOICE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IM GOING TO USE IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY TO TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE.
Reporter CHRIS TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED THE GAME HERE TOO.
THE EASE OF SHOOTING A VIDEO AND POSTING IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS GIVEN THESE SUPERVOTERS EVEN MORE POWER TO SHAPE THE NATURE OF THESE DISCUSSIONS.
VAUGHN IN THE SUNSHINE SHACK IS NEAR A COFFEE POT SO YOU TELL ME WHO HAS IT BEST.
THE REQUEST OF PRESIDENT TRUMPS TAX RETURNS IS ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL AS THE DEMOCRATS TURN TO A GAMECHANGING THREAT.

NOW TO THAT BIG ESCALATION IN THE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMPS TAXES.
THE HOUSE IS SUING THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OVER HIS RETURNS AFTER THEIR REQUESTS AND THEN SUBPOENAS OF THE RETURNS WAS IGNORED BY TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE MNUCHIN AND CHARLES REDDIG.
NOW IT COULD ULTIMATELY BE FOUGHT IN THE SUPREME COURT.
HES BEEN COVERING THIS FOR MONTHS AND ALSO AN MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR.
AND ALSO HES WRITTEN MULTIPLE BOOKS ON THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION.
HES AN EXPERT ON TAX ISSUES AND HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THE PRESIDENTS TAXES FOR YEARS.
SO CHARLIE THE WHITE HOUSE REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH THE SUBPOENA IS AND IM QUOTING HERE AN EXTRAORDINARY ATTACK ON THE AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION NEEDED TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF TREASURY THE IRS AND THE TAX LAWS.
SO WHAT IS THE WEIGHT OF THEM TO COMPLY?
THEYRE STONEWALLING CONGRESS WHICH IS TO SAY ALL OF THEIR REQUESTS ARE ILLEGITIMATE WILL STAND JUDICIAL SCRUTINY.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FIGHTING ALL SUBPOENAS AND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION EVER SINCE THE HOUSE WAS TAKEN OVER BY DEMOCRATS SIX MONTHS AGO BY SAYING THAT CONGRESS ONLY HAS AUTHORITY TO REQUEST INFORMATION IF ITS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO WRITE A NEW LAW AND IT DOESNT HAVE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST INFORMATION TO UNCOVER WRONGDOING.
AND EVEN WHEN IT SAYS ITS TRYING TO WRITE A NEW LAW THE BRANCH CAN SAY THATS JUST A PRETEXT.
THIS IS ABOUT EXPOSING INFORMATION FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.
THATS OUTSIDE YOUR AUTHORITY AND YOU CANT DO THAT.
TWO COURTS HAVE ALREADY REJECTED THAT ARGUMENT AT THE DISTRICT COURT LEVEL AND WILL OFFER SUBPOENAS BY CONGRESS TO FINANCIAL FIRMS FOR TRUMP ORGANIZATION RECORDS.
NOW A THIRD JUDGE WILL GET A CRACK AT IT AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE COMING FROM CONGRESS ITSELF.
HERES PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT.
CHAIRMAN NEALS WILLINGNESS TO USE HIS POWERFUL COMMITTEE TO GO AFTER HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS IS A DANGEROUS DEMOCRACY.
THE COMMITTEE HAS NO LEGITIMATE LEJS LAIFSH PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT CAN DEMAND THE PRESIDENTS TAX RETURNS AND ITS EVIDENT THEY ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN PARTISAN GAINS.
CHARLIE IS THIS PARTISAN?
WHAT COULD BE IN THOSE RETURNS THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO CONGRESS?
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE UTTERLY NAIVE TO THINK ITS NOT POLITICAL OF COURSE ITS POLITICAL ITS JUST WHETHER ITS WITHIN CONGRESS AUTHORITY TO DO IT REGARDLESS OF ITS MOEFSH.
ON THE FACE OF IT THE LAW SAYS THIS COMMITTEE CAN REQUEST ANY INDIVIDUALS TAX RETURNS PERIOD.
IT DOESNT SET A LIMIT.
SO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS KIND OF INVENTING ONE AND WELL SEE WHETHER A JUDGE GOES ALONG WITH THAT.
WHY WOULD THEY WANT IT?
THEYVE SAID ON OTHER OCCASIONS THAT THEY WANTED TO SEE THESE RETURNS BECAUSE EVERY PRESIDENT UNTIL NOW HAS RELEASED HIS RETURNS AND THEY WANT TO ENFORCE THAT TRADITION.
THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF FINANCIAL DEALINGS TRUMP HAS THAT MAY HAVE RUN AFOUL OF THE CONSTITUTION BORROWING AND RECEIVING EMOLLUMENTS AND THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENTS FINANCIAL HEALTH IS AND WHETHER IT LINES UP WITH WHAT HE CLAIMS IT IS ON THE SCALE.
SO THERES ALL KINDS OF REASONS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE THESE AND THEY CLEARLY ALSO WANT TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC.
BUT DAVID WHAT THEY WANT TO PUT OUT THERE IS THE REASON THEY DONT THINK THEY SHOULD TURN THEM OVER AND KIND OF PROTECTING THE OFFICE NOT PROTECTING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE IN THERE THAT WOULD LEAD TO PROBLEMS FOR THE PRESIDENT.
TELL US IN CONTEXT WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS RETURNS AND WHAT MIGHT BE IN THERE.
ALL THE ARGUMENTS BEING MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATION ARE SIMPLY COVER FOR HIDING TRUMPS TAX RETURNS.
AND THE ARGUMENT THAT THE COURTS GOING TO HEAR IS THAT TRUMP HIMSELF HAS MADE THE CASE THAT THERE IS A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE.
HE SAID HES BEEN AUDITED BY THE IRS.
HE CLAIMS HES BEING AUDITED BECAUSE HES A CHRISTIAN.
HE CLAIMS HES BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER PRESIDENTS.
SO HE IN HIS OWN WORDS HAS MADE THE CASE HERE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS AS PART OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS LAW WHICH WAS ENACTED IN 1924 THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE CASE OF THE IRS NOT TURNING OVER INFORMATION WHEN REQUESTED.
IN FACT THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION HAS THREE STAFF MEMBERS WHO WORK IN THE IRS BUILDING BECAUSE THEY REVIEW TAX RETURNS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.
SO MICK MULVANEY TRUMPS ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF HAS SAID THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL NEVER SEE TRUMPS TAX RETURNS.
DAIFRD IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WOULDNT PLACE A BET ON THAT.
THEY WILL SEE TRUMPS TAX RETURNS.
IF THIS ISNT SETTLED BY THE END OF THIS CONGRESS THE CLOCK WILL HAVE TO START WITH NEW LITIGATION BUT WE WILL EVENTUALLY SEE TRUMPS TAX RETURNS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND IN ADDITION THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WHO SIGNED LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES TO THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AND OTHER CONGRESSIONAL TAX COMMITTEES THE NEW YORK STATE INFORMATION FROM TRUMPS TAX RETURNS.
PEOPLE WATCHING SHOULDNT FORGET TRUMP WONT EVEN RELEASE THE AUDIT LETTER ABSOLUTELY ADODINE DOCUMENT THAT CLAIMS HES BEEN AUDITED.
THEY HAVE STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE ITS TAX SHEETS BUT THEY HAVENT NAILED THE CASE YET.
SO CHARLIE WHEN MIGHT WE GET SOMETHING ON THIS?
WHEN MIGHT THIS ALL BE SETTLED?
COULD IT INDEED GO PAST 2020?
EASILY.
A DISTRICT COURT JUDGE HAS TO LOOK AT IT.
ASSUMING TRUMP LOSES HELL APPEAL.
AN APPEALS COURT WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.
WHOEVER LOSES THAT WILL APPEAL TO THE FULL APPEALS COURT.
WHOEVER LOSES THAT WILL APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT.
ITS VERY EASY TO SEE THIS DRAGGING ON FOR A LONG TIME.
ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE TWO CASES I MENTIONED EARLIER INVOLVING SUBPOENAS TO PRIVATE BANKING FIRMS THE LINE JUDGES WHO LOOKED AT BOTH OF THOSE CASES REMOVED THEM VERY QUICKLY.
IN A MATTER OF WEEKS THEY SAID NO TRUMP IS WRONG AND ORDERED THE FIRMS TO COMPLY AND THEN TRUMP APPEALED.
ITS POSSIBLE THAT JUDGES CAN CHOOSE TO MOVE THIS ALONG AND NOT LET IT BE DRAGGED OUT BUT FOR NOW ITS CLEARLY THE STRATEGY OF THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TO JUST BUY TIME AND STALL.
CHARLIE SAVAGE DAVID CAY JOHNSON GOOD TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.
AHEAD OF TOMORROWS ACTIVITIES WHY SOME MILITARY OFFICIALS ARE EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMPS CONTROVERSIAL FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
NT TRUMPS CONTROVERSIAL FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
the clock is ticking on irreversible joint damage.
Ongoing pain and stiffness are signs of joint erosion.
HUMIRA can help stop the clock.
Prescribed for 15 years HUMIRA targets and blocks a source of inflammation that contributes to joint pain and irreversible damage.
HUMIRA can lower your ability to fight infections.
Serious and sometimes fatal infections including tuberculosis and cancers including lymphoma have happened as have blood liver and nervous system problems serious allergic reactions and new or worsening heart failure.
Tell your doctor if youve been to areas where certain fungal infections are common and if youve had TB hepatitis B are prone to infections or have flulike symptoms or sores.
Dont start HUMIRA if you have an infection.
Help stop the clock on further irreversible joint damage.
Talk to your rheumatologist.
Right here.

SO HERES THE PROMISE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TWEETING THIS MORNING.
HELL GIVE THE U.S. QUOTE A SHOW OF A LIFETIME AT TOMORROWS EXPANDED JULY FOURTH CELEBRATION IN WASHINGTON.
HERES ONE LOOK AT HOW THATS COMING ALONG.
POLITICOS HEATHER CAGEL TWEETED THAT A CRANE HAD TO BE USED TO GET AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE.
THERE IS ALSO A REPORT THAT THE EXTRAVAGANZA THAT HES WANTED TO HAVE FOR TWO YEARS NOW WILL BALLOON TO 25 MILLION AND WILL MEAN LESS MONEY FOR THE NATIONAL PARKS.
THE NATIONAL PARKS HAS DIVERTED 2.5 MILLION IN FEES TO COVER SOME OF THE COSTS.
MONICA ALBA JOINS US NOW WITH MORE FROM THE CAPITOL MALL.
WE KNOW THE PENTAGON HAS SCRAMBLED TO GET TOGETHER ON SHORT NOTICE WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE NEEDS.
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON THE GROUND?
Reporter YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME THESE ARE ACTUALLY TWO BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLES.
THIS IS JUST SOME OF THE MILITARY MIGHT THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE ON FULL DISPLAY TOMORROW NIGHT HERE OF COURSE ON THE NATIONAL MALL RIGHT BEHIND ME.
THIS IS JUST SOME OF AN EXAMPLE.
YOU MENTIONED THAT THEY WERE MOVED OVERNIGHT ON TRAINS AND ON FLATBED TRUCKS BECAUSE THESE TANKS ARE SO HEAVY.
THE PRESIDENT FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS TWO YEARS AGO IN PARIS ON BASTILLE DAY AND WANTED TO RECREATE IT BUT A LOT OF CRITICS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER HELL BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS EVENT THAT IS TYPICALLY NONPARTISAN PARTISAN WHETHER HELL GO INTO A CAMPAIGN MODE.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE SPEECH HES GOING TO GIVE WHETHER IT WILL UNIFY ALL AMERICANS HE SAID I THINK SO BUT HES GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.
TOURISTS ARE HERE.
ITS JUST ANOTHER HOT SUMMER DAY.
TOMORROW THIS WILL LOOK DIFFERENT WITH MANY PEOPLE EXPECTED ON THE MALL.
CHRIS?
MONICA ALBA THANK YOU FOR THAT.
PHIL RUCKER IS BACK WITH ME AS WELL AS JACK JACOBS A MEDAL AFTER HONOR RECIPIENT AND MSNBC MILITARY CONTRIBUTOR.
PHIL YOU SAID QUOTE THIS YEARS GATHERING ON THE MALL MARKS A DEPARTURE BECAUSE PRESIDENTS TYPICALLY HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS.
WHY INDEPENDENCE DAY IF YOURE DOING A MILITARY PARADE?
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT ALL THIS BECAUSE IT WAS ALL PRETTY FAST.
THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO DO A MILITARY PARADE AND THOSE PLANS WERE THWARTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OVER CONCERNS ABOUT COST AND JUST INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS WITH ROLLING TANKS THROUGH THE STREETS OF A CITY.
SO THE PARADE WAS NOT TO BE.
THE PRESIDENT SEIZED ON THIS JULY 4th MOMENT AS A CHANCE TO PUT HIS OWN MARK ON WHAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A DECIDEDLY NONPARTISAN CELEBRATION IN THE NATIONS CAPITOL.
HES WANTED TO HAVE BIGGER FIREWORKS THAN NORMAL HES WANTED TO PUT HIMSELF AT CENTER STAGE HES GIVEN OUT VIP TICKETS TO HIS POLITICAL DONORS AND MEANWHILE ITS BEING FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT BY HIS CAMPAIGN.
AND IN FACT MY COLLEAGUES AT THE POST HAVE REPORTED LAST NIGHT THAT 2.5 MILLION ON NATIONAL PARK ENTRY FEES THESE ARE THE FEES YOU PAY WHEN YOU GO TO VISIT YOSEMITE OR YELLOWSTONE OR ANY OF THESE NATIONAL PARKS THAT THAT MONEY HAS BEEN DIVERTED AWAY FROM THE PARKS TO HELP FUND TOMORROWS CELEBRATION.
THERE ARE COLONEL AS YOU KNOW RUSSIA HAS VICTORY DAY WE MENTIONED HE WAS AT BASTILLE DAY WHERE HE KIND OF GOT THE IDEA THAT HE WANTED THIS.
DO YOU SHARE THE CONCERNS WEVE HEARD FROM FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS THAT LOOK YOU HAVE TO KEEP THIS STUFF APOLITICAL AND IT CLEARLY IS NOT?
I DO AND PEOPLE IVE TALKED TO DO AS WELL.
WEVE HAD A LONG HISTORY TRADITION OF AGO AN APOLITICAL FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
WERE CELEBRATING THE FOUNDER OF THE COUNTRY NOT CELEBRATING OUR MILITARY MIGHT.
THE THING THAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST IS THE FACT THAT WE DONT HAVE TO SHOW OUR MILITARY MIGHT.
YOU KNOW THERE ARE TANK COUNTRIES AND THERE ARE NON TANK COUNTRIES.
WE ARE A NONTANK COUNTRIES.
IRAN IS A TANK COUNTRY.
NORTH KOREA RUSSIA CHINA THOSE ARE ALL TANK COUNTRIES.
WE DONT HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE  AS A MATTER OF FACT ITS PART OF OUR STRENGTH THAT WE DONT HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR STRENGTH IN THIS WAY.
AND THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE DRAWS IS THAT THIS IS MERELY A ITS NOT EVEN A THINLY VEILED CAMPAIGN EVENT IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A CAMPAIGN EVENT AND IT PANDERS TO THE LEAST SAVORY OF ALL OF OUR POLITICAL NOTIONS CHRIS.
WELL THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT WERE SEEING A LITTLE BIT HERE PHIL IS THAT THIS IS IN SOME WAYS NOT UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT TWEETING THAT HED LIKE TO MEET KIM JONGUN AT THE DMZ AND THEN THERES A BIG SCRAMBLING.
THE PRESS SECRETARY GETS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND ALL THESE THINGS NEED TO GET DONE AT THE LAST MINUTE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THATS WHAT HAPPENED WITH PENTAGON IN THIS CASE.
CHRIS I THINK WHATS GOING ON HERE IS THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IS TRYING TO PRODUCE THIS EVENT.
REMEMBER HIS BACKGROUND IS IN PUTTING ON REALITY TELEVISION SHOWS.
HE CARES INTENSELY ABOUT THE STAGING OF HIS POLITICAL RALLIES ABOUT WHAT GOES WHERE WHAT EQUIPMENT WOULD BE INVOLVED.
HES BEEN VERY HANDSON IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE PLANS FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY ON THE MALL.
CURRENTLY JACK DOES IT BOTHER YOU WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD MULTIPLE NUCLEAR THREATS AMONG THEM THAT THIS IS HOW THE PRESIDENT IS SPENDING HIS TIME?
WELL OF COURSE ITS BOTHERSOME BUT DONT FORGET  LOOK HES NOT ALONE.
ALL PRESIDENTS ARE ALWAYS CAMPAIGNING ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
BUT THIS IS REALLY IN YOUR FACE AND ITS CLEAR THAT HIS FOCUS IS LESS CLEAR ON THE KIND OF THINGS THAT KEEP US FREE THAN THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY KEEP US FREE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO GO BACK A COUPLE WEEKS AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE POSITIVITY OF INTELLIGENT AND STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING TAKING PLACE JUST IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WITH IRAN BEING AGGRESSIVE IN THE GULF THE ATTACKS ON THE SHIPS THERE WHATS TAKEN PLACE IN IRAN NOW PLUS UPPING ITS NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.
NO RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES TO SPEAK OF.
SAME THING IN KOREA AND NORTH KOREA CHINA SPREADING OUT ACROSS THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND SO ON.
THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO WITH OUR MILITARY.
THIS ISNT ONE OF THEM.
COLONEL JACK JACOBS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HAPPY FOURTH AND TO YOU PHIL RUCKER AS WELL.
THANKS GUYS.
UP NEXT IT MIGHT NOT COME AS A SURPRISE THAT POLLS SHOW ELIZABETH WARREN AND KAMALA HARRIS GETTING A BUMP AFTER THEIR DEBATE PERFORMANCES BUT A NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS EXACTLY WHERE THEIR GAINS ARE COMING FROM.
THIS MORNING A NEW WASHINGTON POSTABC POLL SHOWS WHILE KAMALA HARRIS AND ELIZABETH WARREN DID GET A BOOST JOE BIDEN STILL LEADS.
AND THAT LEAD HAS DIMINISHED THOUGH HE REMAINS AT THE TOP OF EVERY NATIONAL POLL WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE DEBATES.
THIS MORNING WE MAY KNOW WHY.
IT GOES BEYOND IOWA AND BEYOND THE NOMINATION.
45 OF VOTERS THINK THAT HE IS THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP IN THE GENERAL LOCATION.
JOINING ME TO WEIGH IN IS FOUNDER OF PULSO A SOCIAL MEDIA.
TYLER ARE BACK WITH ME.
DOUG DO YOU THINK ITS THAT SIMPLE?
BIDEN IS STILL IN THE LEAD BECAUSE HE IS VIEWED AS MORE MODERATE AND DEMOCRATS THINK HE CAN WIN IN THE GENERAL?
WELL I THINK IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT.
AFRICANAMERICANS HAVE BEEN A BASE OF HIS SUPPORT SINCE HE STARTED.
HES DOING WELL WITH OLDER VOTERS.
HES DOING WELL WITH MODERATE VOTERS.
SO HES GOT A BROADER COALITION.
DEPENDING WHAT POLLS YOU LOOK AT THEY ARE SAYING DIFFERENT THINGS.
I WOULD JUST BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT INTERPRETING THEM TOO MUCH UNTIL A COUPLE WEEKS AFTER THE DEBATES HAVE PASSED.
WELL LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING THOUGH.
THIS IS INTERESTING.
538 DID SOMETHING REALLY SMART.
THEY TOOK A GROUP OF VOTERS BEFORE THE DEBATES AND POLLED THEM.
THEN THEY DID ONE AFTER THE DEBATE.
SO YOU ACTUALLY SEE HOW THE DEBATES MOVED THINGS.
THE BIG WINNER KAMALA HARRIS UP JULIAN CASTRO ELIZABETH WARREN ALSO GAINING.
DOWN IS JOE BIDEN BETO OROURKE AND PETE BUTTIGIEG.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT LIZ?
I WOULD SAY THERE ARE SEVERAL POLLS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT.
THE POLL THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY THAT SURVEYED VOTERS SHOWED THAT KAMALA HARRIS WENT UP FROM SIXTH PLACE UP TO FIRST AND JULIAN CASTRO HAD A BIG JUMP.
WE KNOW THAT THE LATIN COMMUNITY WILL BE THE LARGEST MINORITY VOTING BLOC IN 2020.
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?
WELL MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN OUR COMMUNITY IS INCREASING NOT ONLY IN VOTING AGE BUT NUMBERS OVERALL.
WILL 00000 EVERY SINGLE DAY.
SO WE KNOW THE CANDIDATE THAT IS ELECTED IN 2020 IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES WILL NOT WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION.
SO THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO WON WHO LOST AND RICK I THINK THESE POLLS ARENT JUST BEING WATCHED CLOSELY BY THESE CAMPAIGNS BUT BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
WHAT DO THEY TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR?
WELL I THINK JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN MOVED.
HARRIS IS RIGHT WHERE SHE WANTS TO BE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THE FRONT RUNNER THIS EARLY O.
WOULDNT TRUMP RATHER RUN AGAINST HER THAN BIDEN?
ITS TOO EARLY TO SAY.
THE LEADERS WILL SHIFT A LITTLE BIT.
LOST GROUND IN EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC.
IT PROBABLY CAME OUT OF JOE BIDEN.
ELIZABETH WARREN WAS FLAT ACTUALLY.
SHE LOST SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT.
JOE BIDEN STILL REMAINS THE TOP OF THE HEAP AND THE PERSON BELIEVE WILL BEAT DONALD TRUMP.
KAMALA HARRIS HAS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN HER BELIEVABILITY SHE CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP.
THAT IS A HUGE FACTOR THIS TIME AROUND.
OBVIOUSLY DOUG YOU HAVE TO BUILD A WINNING COALITION.
A NEW PIECE BY ALEX SIGHTSWALD WHO WRITES HARRIS STUNNED BIDEN BUT CAN SHE WIN AN OBAMA COALITION?
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AT THIS POINT WHO IS DOING THE RIGHT THINGS TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION.
YOU START PUTTING ORGANIZERS ON THE GROUND.
KAMALA HARRISS CAMPAIGN IS DOING THAT MORE AND MORE IN IOWA AND SOUTH CAROLINA.
ELIZABETH WARREN HAS A HUGE FIELD STAFF SHE HAS INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF KEY EARLY STATES.
SO HAVING THAT DIRECT PERSONTOPERSON COMMUNICATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF BUILDING OUT YOUR COALITION.
WHEN THE CANDIDATES START TO ADVERTISE AND GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT THATS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT.
BUT LOOK I WOULD JUST I WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH ONE THING THAT RICK SAID.
I THINK WITH KAMALA HARRIS YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDNT KNOW HER OR ELIZABETH WARREN.
BOTH DID VERY WELL.
LIZ WETTING WARREN DID WELL AS WELL.
SEIZE THE DAY RIGHT?
THANKS TO ALL OF YOU.
HAPPY FOURTH.
