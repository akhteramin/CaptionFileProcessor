FIVE OF THE TOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE SHARING THE SAME STAGE TONIGHT WITH YOUNG ADULTS
FOR STUDENTS WHO PLAN TO VOTE IN THEIR STATE AND PRIMARY CAUCUSES.

WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM SENATORS AMY KLOBUCHAR, ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS.

RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO WELCOME TO THIS STAGE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS OF CALIFORNIA.
HI, HI.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

HAVE A SEAT.
THANK YOU.
WOW, THEY'RE HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
LET'S GET TO IT. WE WANT YOU TO GET AS MUCH OUT OF THE NEXT HOUR AS POSSIBLE.

LET'S START WITH WHAT'S DOMINATING THE NEWS,
THE FALLOUT FROM THE MUELLER REPORT.
YES.
WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM C CARCARLA ALVARADO,
A SENIOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
GOOD EVENING, SENATOR HARRIS,

IN LIGHT OF MUELLER'S REPORT DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS A CONGRESS SHOULD RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION ON IMPEACHMENT?
IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO ON WHAT THEIR POSITION IS,
HERE'S WHAT I FEEL ABOUT IT AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, CARLA.
LOOK, FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION AND HAVE SEEN ANY PART OF THAT REPORT
IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD EVIDENCE POINTING TO OBSTRUCTION AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
AND I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY, FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR -THE TABLE SET.
I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THAT IS PART OF THE PREMISE, OBVIOUSLY, OF MY PLAN.
BUT I THINK WE ARE VERY GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WHICH HAS PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT TELLS US THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED IN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE THE STEPS TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT.
BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T END THERE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THIS.
I'M ALSO A REALIST. AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE TWO YEARS AND SOME MONTHS I'VE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE
I HAVE ALSO WITNESSED FOLKS IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE GOP
WHO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH MANY REASONS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT AND THEY HAVE NOT.
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS
THERE WILL BE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE AND AN INVESTIGATION THAT TAKES PLACE.
I THINK WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN
AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO OVER TO THE SENATE. AND THE HOUSE NEEDS TO BE A VOTE BY A MAJORITY, A SIMPLE MAJORITY
AND THEN IT'S GOING TO COME OVER TO THE SENATE
AND I'VE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE, SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE,
THAT SENATE AND THE REPUBLICANS HOLD THE MAJORITY,
I'VE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY WILL WEIGH ON THE FACTS INSTEAD OF ON PARTISAN ADHERENCE TO BEING PROTECTIVE OF THIS PRESIDENT
AND THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS ME AND WHAT WILL BE THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME.
WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE END RESULT
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE PROCESS SHOULD NOT TAKE HOLD.
THANK YOU, SENATOR.

A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE AT THE HARVARD INSTITUTE OF POLITICS,
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THEM AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
BEN.

THANK YOU, SENATOR,

AS A FUTURE EDUCATOR I AM REALLY BOTHERED THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BEING TARGETS FOR MASS SHOOTINGS.
TWO DAYS AGO WAS THE 20th ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE,
BUT TWO DECADES LATER NO MAJOR GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED.
AS PRESIDENT WHO WILL YOU GO ABOUT KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS SAFE AND KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM?
I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF STUDENTS HERE, WHILE YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, EVEN MIDDLE SCHOOL, THAT YOU HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN A DRILL, RIGHT,
WHERE YOU WERE CONVENED AND YOUR TEACHERS TAUGHT YOU ABOUT HOW YOU NEED TO GO AND RUN IN A CLOSET BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF YOUR SCHOOL.
AND IN OUR AMERICA THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO HAPPEN.
CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE
EVERY NIGHT,
CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE EVERY NIGHT BETWEEN STATUTES AND THEIR PARENTS,
WHY DO THESE THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN,
WHY DO WE HAVE A DRILL LIKE THAT
AND THE RESPONSE IS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., SUPPOSED LEADERS.
WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE
WHICH YOU'RE EITHER IN FAVOR OF SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE'S GUNS AWAY.
SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO HAVE FAILED THE COURAGE TO RECOGNIZE,
YOU WANT TO GO HUNTING, THAT'S FINE,
BUT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY, STARTING WITH UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN
BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT. BEN HERE IS MY RESPONSE TO YOU.
UPON BEING ELECTED I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO PASS REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
AND IF THEY FAIL TO DO IT, THEN I WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WILL DO IS PUT IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT THAT FOR ANYONE WHO SELLS MORE THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS WHEN THEY SELL THOSE GUNS.
I WILL REQUIRE THAT FOR ANY GUN DEALER THAT BREAKS THE LAW THE ATF TAKE THEIR LICENSE.
AND BY THE WAY, ATF, ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS,
THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF "A" ANDTâ– IF" WE NEED TO FIX THAT.
AND THEN
-ON THE THIRD PIECE, BECAUSE NONE OF US HAVE BEEN SLEEPING THE LAST TWO YEARS,
PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENED UNDER THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS THEY TYKE FUGITIVES OFF THE LIST OF PROHIBITED PEOPLE.
I PUT THEM BACK ON THE LIST, MEANING THAT FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A HANDGUN OR ANY KIND OF WEAPON.
SO THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.
WOULD THIS BE YOUR FIRST EXECUTIVE ACTION AS PRESIDENT?
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT ELSE HAPPENS. AFTER 100 DAYS.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS.
ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.
ANGELA IS A FRESHMAN STUDYING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
SHE IS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. ANGELA?
GOOD EVENING, SENATOR, MY QUESTION IS AS A COLLEGE STUDENT WITH OVER $25,000 OF DEBT IN MY FIRST YEAR ALONE
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ALLEVIATE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS.
DO YOU SUPPORT INITIATIVES SUCH AS FREE COLLEGE, LOAN PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION, OR STUDENT REPAYMENT PLANS?
YEAH, ANGELA. KNOW, LISTEN, THE STUDENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE AMONG THE TOP FIVE IN THE COUNTRY WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE HAVE STUDENTS IN AMERICA WHO ARE IN ABSOLUTE FEAR ABOUT THE DEBT THAT THEY WILL OWE UPON GRADUATION.
AND I HAVE MET AND KNOW SO MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CAREER BASED ON THEIR FEAR THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS.
I KNOW SO MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE GRADUATED WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE A FAMILY
BASED ON THE BURDEN OF THEIR STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND BEING CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE MONTH.
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE AN INVESTMENT OF THEIR TIME AND THEIR RESOURCES
BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANT AN EDUCATION TO LIVE A PRODUCTIVE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY AND BE LEADERS.
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO SPECIFICALLY. I DO SUPPORT DEBT FREE COLLEGE.
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBT
AND IN PARTICULAR I'M SUPPORTING AN INITIATIVE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBTING TO BE ON PAR WITH FEDERAL LENDING AMOUNTS.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU -PROBABLY NONE OF YOU HERE, BUT ANY OF YOUR OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
IF YOU TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANS BETWEEN 2006 AND 2013, THE INTEREST RATE WAS ABOUT 7%.
WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS REGARDLESS OF THE INTEREST RATE AT THE TIME THAT YOU TOOK OUT OUR STUDENT LOANS, THAT UPON REPAYMENT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT
THE OTHER THING IS THIS. PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT TERMS OF REPAYMENT
THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU OWE AND YOUR INCOME.
WHAT I WOULD BE REQUIRING IS THAT THERE BE A ROBUST PROCESS BY WHICH INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT WOULD BE THE NORM.
AND FINALLY LET'S LOOK AT THE FACT THAT FOR ALL OF YOU AND ALL OF ANYBODY WHO HAS APPLIED FOR FINANCIAL AID
THAT IS AN AWFUL PROCESS.
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
ALL THOSE PAGES.
YOU CAN'T BARELY GET THROUGH THAT FORM.
AND SO PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SIMPLIFY THAT PROCESS.
BUT WE HAVE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, TEACHERS.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME,
I THINK A LOT ABOUT EDUCATION IN TERMS OF EVERY ASPECT OF IT FROM STUDENT LOANS TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PAY OUR TEACHERS THEIR VALUE.
AND NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHO HAVE LEFT THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY OFF THEIR STUDENT LOANS
RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT ACTUALLY A DEFICIT OF TEACHERS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WE NEED TO ACTUALLY TEACH AND THE FEW TEACHERS WE HAVE, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS,
IT'S A BIG ISSUE AND CROSSES A LOT OF SUBJECTS.
TEACHERS CAN'T PAY THEIR LOANS.
ELIZABETH WARREN IS HERE, AS YOU KNOW,
SHE SAID THAT SHE SUPPORTS STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR 42 MILLION AMERICANS.

WOULD YOU GO THAT FAR? DO YOU SUPPORT THAT?
WELL, I SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT IS ABOUT REDUCING THE DEBT OF STUDENT LOANS. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE.
FAIR ENOUGH.
LET'S MOVE ON NOW. RYAN WILSON IS HERE, A SOPHOMORE AT HARVARD STUDYING NEUROSCIENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND A SUPPORTER OF JULIAN CASTRO. RYAN.
HI, GOOD EVENING SENATOR HARRIS,
I'M A CONSTITUENT OF YOURS FROM ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.
AT JANUARY TOWN HALL WHEN ASKED ABOUT YOUR APPROACH TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGED YOU WOULD SUPPORT
-HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE 74% OF AMERICANS WHO WISH TO HAVE THE OPTION TO KEEP THEIR PRIVATE INSURERS?
WELL, I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. AND I SUPPORT IT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.
THAT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT
AND THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE AND I BELIEVE IT'S A MORAL ISSUE
AND IT IS A SIGN OF WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO BE A CIVIL SOCIETY. TO DETERMINE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD IT
WHEN, IN FACT, THAT SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE OF THE FEW WHO CAN AFFORD IT.
THAT IS THE VALUE WITH WHICH I WILL ALSO SAY THIS.ION.
ON THE ISSUE OF THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC ABOUT ACCESS TO PRIVATE INSURANCE, OF COURSE PRIVATE INSURANCE YOU CAN GET SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE AND ALL OF THAT.
BUT LET'S NOT BE DUPED BY A MESSAGING CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BEEN WAGED FOR YEARS BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES
TO HAVE YOU INTO BELIEVING YOU NEED TO DEFEND THEM. YOU NEED TO DEFEND YOURSELF.
YOU KNOW WHAT, 91% OF THE DOCTORS ARE IN MEDICARE.
SO THE IDEA AND THE SUGGESTION THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE TO YOU IS REALLY A FALSE ONE.
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR DOCTOR.
91% OF THEM ARE IN THE MEDICARE SYSTEM.
AND I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING, AND IT'S A PERSONAL STORY,
MY MOTHER, WHO -YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER WAS ALL OF 5'0" TALL, IF YOU WOULD HAVE MET HER, YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS 7'0".
INCREDIBLE WOMAN, BREAST CANCER, RESEARCHER.
WE GOT CANCER.
AND SHE ULTIMATELY PASSED AWAY FROM CANCER.
BUT IF YOU HAVE EVER HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF GOING THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS AN ACUTE ILLNESS,
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS.
IT IS HAVING A DOCTOR SAY TO YOU HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE TERM ANTICIPATORY GRIEF?
WHICH YOU HADN'T HEARD BEFORE BUT WHEN YOU HEAR IT IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE,
YOU'RE STARTING ALREADY TO GRIEVE THE LOSS OF SOMEONE THAT IS STILL AROUND.
YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS HELPING SOMEONE WHO IS FRAIL AND WEAK, IN AND OUT OF CARS TO GET INTO A HOSPITAL.
YOU LOOK AT MEDICAL CHARTS AND SOMETIMES THE MEDICINE JIVES, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T,
SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS IS THE MEDICATION THAT CAUSES DROWSINESS
THEY DON'T WANT OR PAIN THEY CAN'T BEAR.
YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WORRYING ABOUT IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN COOK AND BE ABLE TO FOR YOU TO EAT AND HOLD DOWN.
THE PROCESS OF BEING CONCERNED ABOUT CHEMOTHERAPY, CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING SOFT ENOUGH TO WEAR THAT WILL NOT IRRITATE YOUR SKIN.
THANKFULLY OUR MOTHER HAD MEDICARE, PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS EVERY DAY IN AMERICA,
FOR THEM TO ALSO HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THAT BILL IS UNCONSCIONABLE.
AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS SUBJECT.
COSTS SHOULD NOT BE THE BARRIER TO RECEIVING THE CARE THAT WILL RELIEVE YOU OF PAIN OR HELP IMPROVE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE.
AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT. THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
YEAH. SO YOU MENTIONED THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO DEFEND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES.
NO, I DON'T HAVE TO --
THE BILL THAT YOU CO-SPONSORED WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE PRIVATE INSURANCE.
IS THERE ROOM FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE IN
-- OF COURSE THERE IS, FOR SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE, ABSOLUTELY.
FOR COMPANIES, FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES. LULT. ROOM IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION FOR THAT.
YEAH.
BUT LISTEN IN THIS BILL.
BUT DON, I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GOAL.
RIGHT, I MEAN, WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE INTERMEDIATE STEPS.
BUT THE GOAL HAS TO BE, AND WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE, ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT AND SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS A RIGHT AND PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD CREATE IT
SUCH THAT IT IS A REAL RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT
AND IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IMPACTING AMERICAN FAMILIES RIGHT NOW.
I'M TRAVELING THIS COUNTRY. IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES.
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SIT DOWN AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OR NOT BASED ON MONEY, YOU WOULD BE SHOCKED,
ONE OUT OF FOUR DIABETES PATIENTS IN OUR COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD THEIR INSULIN.
THERE IS A DRUG THAT HELPS SAVE A LIFE IF THERE HAS BEEN AN OVERDOSE OF OPIOIDS.
AND THAT DRUG CAN COST UP TO THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE.
LISTEN, BUT TO BE CLEAR, THIS BILL THAT YOU CO-SPONSORED ESSENTIALLY PHASES OUT PRIVATE INSURANCE IN FOUR YEARS.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT THE STUDIES SHOW, THAT IT WOULD PHASE OUT PRIVATE INSURANCE.
I'M ACTUALLY SUPPORTING

-- MEDICARE FOR ALL?
CO-SPONSORING WITH BERNIE SANDERS
PHASES OUT PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES
-- AS THE MAIN SOURCE, BUT THERE WILL STILL BE SUPPLEMENTAL,
THERE WILL STILL BE ACCESS TO SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE.


MEDICARE FOR ALL UNDER THE CARE I'M SUPPORTING WILL EXTEND COVERAGE,
IT DOES NOT COVER DENTAL, VISION, HEARING AIDS,
UNDER THE PLAN MEDICARE FOR ALL IT WILL COVER -THOSE NEEDS WILL BE COVERED. THEY WILL BE AN EXTENSION OF IT,
INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, INCLUDING WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AROUND WOMEN HAVING GREATER ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE.
NOW THEEN NEW DEAL.
YES.
REEN NEW DEAL, EVERYONE HERE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.
MAX RATNER,
NOW A STUDENT,
HE INTERNED FOR SENATOR ED MARKEY.

SENATOR HARRIS, THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS NOT A LAW BUT RATHER A MEMORANDUM THAT HAS NO ACTUAL LEGISLATIVE EFFECT.
IT'S BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS EXPENSIVE, DIVIDES DEMOCRATS AND HAS NO CHANCE OF PASSING THROUGH CONGRESS IN ITS CURRENT STATE.
WHY DO YOU SUPPORT IT?
I SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I, TO MY CORE, KNOW THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS REPRESENTING AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS,
WE HAVE SUPPOSED LEADERS PUSHING SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT
AND THIS IS TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL IF WE DON'T TAKE THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY WITH A SENSE OF YOU ARE URGENCY.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL APPRECIATES THAT
WE NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING EVERY DAY ON THIS ISSUE AND EVERY DAY WE FAIL TO ACT WILL BE TO OUR COLLECTIVE CONSEQUENCE.
THE U.N. HAS ALREADY SAID OVER THE NEXT 12 YEARS IF WE DON'T GET THIS STRAIGHT THERE WILL BE SEVERE CONSEQUENCE
AND THIS IS WITHIN OUR ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
LISTEN, I HAVE -FAMILIES ARE IMPACTED BY THIS.
YOU KNOW, CHILDREN, SENIORS, WE ALL NEED TO DRINK CLEAN AIR -- WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR.
AND DON'T DRINK THE AIR.
YOU LOOK AT FARMERS. FARMERS ARE IMPACTED BY THIS. CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FIREFIGHTERS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.
ACROSS THE BOARD PEOPLE ARE BEING IMPACTED BY THIS.
LET'S ALSO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE IN SO MANY STATES GREAT WORK THAT IS HAPPENING
THAT IS ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMY AROUND AN INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES.
THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS CAME OUT WITH A LIST LAST YEAR OF THE TOP 20 JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO SEE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH IN OUR COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO, INSULATION MAINTENANCE OF WIND TURBINES AND SOLAR PANELS, LOOKING AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE KNEE TO BE TRUE ABOUT WATER,
WATER IS A PRECIOUS AND DIMINISHING RESOURCE ON OUR PLANET.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND SHIFTING POPULATIONS, AROUND THE GLOBE, CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS IN WHAT IS HAPPENING.
THERE WAS A TIME AND STILL TO THIS DAY WHERE WE'RE FIGHTING WARS OVER OIL.
IN A SHORT MATTER OF TIME, GUYS, WE'RE GOING FIGHTING WARS OVER WATER.
PART OF WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ON ALL THESE MATTERS,
INCLUDING THE PRECIOUS NATURE OF WATER AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE SMARTER ON PUBLIC POLICY.
I THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE NEED TO REALLY DIVERSIFY PUBLIC POLICY ON WATER
WITH AN EQUAL EMPHASIS ON RECYCLING, CONSERVATION, CAPTURE OF WATER, STORAGE OF WATER. DESALINATION.
WE NEED TO INVEST IN ELECTRIC CARS.
WE NEED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.
ALL OF THAT IS IN THE GREEN NEW DEAL.
THE GREATEST THING ABOUT IT THAT I AM REALLY ENJOYING,
THIS IS CAUSING THESE CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN AROUND OUR COUNTRY IN A WAY THEY'VE NOT BEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.
AND HOPEFULLY EVERYONE IS UNDERSTANDING THAT SO MUCH OF THE HARM WE ARE DOING TO OUR PLANET IS CAUSED BY US AS HUMAN BEINGS.
AND THE SOLUTIONS WILL BE BECAUSE WE CHANGE OUR BEHAVIORS WITHOUT MUCH REQUIREMENT OF CHANGE TO LIFESTYLE
AND IT WILL BE URGENT IN TERMS OF THE WORK WE NEED TO DO AND THE APPROACH HAVE.
BUT WE CAN SEE SUCCESS.
WE'VE SEEN IT IN CALIFORNIA.
IN CALIFORNIA WE MADE A DECISION THAT WE WOULD GO BACK TO THE 1990 STANDARDS IN TERMS OF EMISSIONS, BY THE YEAR 2020. AND WE'VE ALREADY MET THOSE GOALS.
THIS CAN HAPPEN. WE CAN DO IT. BUT THERE HAS TO BE LEADERSHIP IN OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE NEED A NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
ALL RIGHT. SO SPEAKING OF AIR AND WATER, LET'S TAKE A BREATHER,

GET A SIP OF WATER AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE OF CNN'S PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL EVENT,
STAY WITH US.
