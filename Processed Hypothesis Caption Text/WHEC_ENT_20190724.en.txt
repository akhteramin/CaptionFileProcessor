 LIVINGSTON COUNTY SHERIFF TOM DOUGHERTY SAYS ITS UP TO HIS DEPUTIES Sheriff Tom Dougherty Livingston County Sheriff 5659 And ultimately if their license is removed and they dont have that privilege anymore theyre extremely upset.
They have to rely on friends and neighbors and families for rides.
08 But I would say as sheriff my number one priority is keeping the roads safe.
12 TYPING I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MANY TYPING I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MANY REPORTS ARE FILED EVERY YEAR?
HOW MANY DRIVERS LOSE THEIR LICENSE?
AND WHY DOES ONE PERSON GET A ROAD TEST LIKE ROSALIE AND ANOTHER DRIVER DOESNT?
THE STATE DMV WOULDNT ANSWER THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.
BUT WROTE IN AN EMAIL... The thorough review process allows a driver to demonstrate their fitness to drive and helps the DMV ensure safety on New Yorks roadways for all who use them which is our top priority.
