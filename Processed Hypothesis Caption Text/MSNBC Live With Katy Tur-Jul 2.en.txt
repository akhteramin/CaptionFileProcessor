Learn more at FreeStyleLibre.us IT WAS JULY 2017 WHEN DONALD TRUMP JUST MONTHS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY VISITED FRANCE ON BASTILLE DAY.
HE ATTENDED A MILITARY PARADE.
HE WAS IMPRESSED.
THE MILITARY MIGHT THE SOLDIERS THE TANKS.
HE WANTED HIS OWN PARADE.
TWO YEARS LATER IT LOOKS LIKE HES GETTING HIS WISH.
THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL IS BEING PREPPED FOR A JULY 4th SPECTACULAR A POSSIBLE AIR FORCE ONE FLYOVER AND YOU GUESSED IT THANKS.
THERES NOT ONLY CONCERN ABOUT POTENTIAL PARTISAN NATURE OF THE PRESIDENTS EVENT BUT THOSE TANKS HAVE PROVEN TRICKY FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
HERE HE WAS YESTERDAY.
WERE GOING TO HAVE SOME TANKS STATIONED OUTSIDE.
GOT TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE TANKS BECAUSE THE ROADS HAVE A TENDENCY NOT TO LIKE HEAVY TANKS SO WE HAVE TO PUT THEM IN CERTAIN AREAS.
WE HAVE THE BRANDNEW SHERMAN TANKS THE BRANDNEW ABRAM TANKS AND WE HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE EQUIPMENT MILITARY EQUIPMENT ON DISPLAY.
BRANDNEW.
AND WERE VERY PROUD OF IT.
SO A COUPLE ISSUES HERE FOR THE PRESIDENT.
ONE SHERMAN TANKS HAVE NOT BEEN IN ACTIVE SERVICE SINCE THE 1950s.
PROBLEM TWO THE TANKS THAT ARE COMING WEIGH ABOUT 60 TONS EACH AND THERE IS VERY REAL CONCERN THEY COULD DO MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE CAPITOL CITY STREETS BRIDGES AND OF COURSE OUR COUNTRYS FAMED NATIONAL MALL.
JOINING ME NOW WASHINGTON POST SENIOR NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT JULIET AND MARK JACOBSON.
WERE GOING TO TALK WITH MARK IN A SECOND ABOUT THE TANKS BUT FIRST THE CONCERNS POTENTIALLY HERE ABOUT PARTISANSHIP ON WHAT IS TYPICALLY YOU KNOW A PATRIOTIC HOLIDAY CELEBRATED BY ALL AMERICANS.
KELLYANNE CONWAY THIS MORNING INSISTED THAT IT WOULD BE APOLITICAL.
TAKE A LOOK.
WHY IS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE GIVING OUT TICKETS TO SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT?
WHY ARE  THIS IS A PUBLIC EVENT.
ITS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
THE PUBLIC IS WELCOME TO COME AND CELEBRATE OUR GREAT COUNTRY.
THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY.
THE CONSTITUTION ALL THE AMENDMENTS NOT JUST THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT SEEMS TO ONLY INTEREST YOU ONLY.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT ALL THE OTHERS.
BUT REALLY JUST THE BIRTH OF THIS COUNTRY THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY THAT EVER LIVED.
IM NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO POLITICIZE IT.
FAIR TO SAY THAT IT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
HOWEVER THERE IS THIS VIP SECTION RIGHT UP FRONT WHERE YOU KNOW TYPICALLY ANYONE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE IN THAT AREA OF THE MALL TO WATCH THE FIREWORKS IF YOU GOT THERE EARLY ENOUGH.
NOW THE RNC HAS GOTTEN TICKETS AND THE DNC TELLS PETER ALEXANDER THEY HAVENT RECEIVED AN ALLOTMENT OF TICKETS FOR THAT AREA.
IT KIND OF UNDERMINES THIS ARGUMENT.
SURE THE FACT THERES LIMITED VIP SEAT CHICAGO WE REPORTED ON LAST WEEK SHOWS YOU THAT REALLY THAT THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME POLITICAL ELEMENTS.
NOW THE RNC WE CHECKED WITH THEM TODAY.
THEYRE ARGUING IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF A DEMOCRAT WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE THEY WOULD GIVE TICKETS TO THEIR PARTY.
THAT THESE THINGS HAPPEN FOR WHITE HOUSE HOLIDAY TOURS FOR THINGS LIKE THAT.
THATS ACCURATE ALTHOUGH AGAIN THOSE ARE WHERE YOU HAVE LIMITS ON WHO CAN BE HERE.
THIS TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN AN ENTIRELY OPEN EVENT AND ITS NOW BEING MODIFIED TO YOU KNOW TO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS IN PART OF THE MALL.
AND WE ARE OF COURSE GOING TO GET A SPEECH FROM THE PRESIDENT.
I MEAN ITS HARD TO ARGUE THAT ANY SPEECH IN THIS KIND OF A FORUM WOULD BE AN APOLITICAL ONE.
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS IT REALLY WILL MATTER WHAT HE SAYS WHETHER HE REFERS TO FOR EXAMPLE ANY OF THE DEMOCRATS CURRENTLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020.
WHETHER HE TALKS ABOUT POLLING.
THOSE ARE ALL COMMENTS THAT COULD TRIGGER THIS PROVISION WHERE UNDER FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW YOU CANT USE PUBLIC RESOURCES FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.
AND IF THEY DEEM THAT PART OF THIS IS A POLITICAL SPEECH THE CAMPAIGN TRUMPS PRESIDENTIAL REELECTION CAMPAIGN MIGHT HAVE TO REIMBURSE THE U.S. TREASURY FOR SOME OF THE EXPENSES OF THIS EVENT.
SPEAKING OF THOSE EXPENSES MARK JACOBSON THESE TANKS ARE LOGISTICALLY DIFFICULT TO GET HERE.
THIS IS ALSO GOING TO COST THE U.S. MILITARY NOT AN INSIGIVE IN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY.
DOES THE MILITARY COMMUNITY KIND OF AGREE HERE WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?
I SUSPECT THE MILITARY COMMUNITY AND GOING BASED ON CONVERSATIONS IVE HAD WITH THOSE ON ACTIVE DUTY AND VETERANS THERES A MIX OF  MIXED VIEW ON THIS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ENTIRE WEEK THIS SHOULD BE A BLIP COMPARED TO ALL THE MISTAKES TRUMP SEEMS TO HAVE MADE ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY FRONT.
AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE THATS IN DEBT ALREADY.
THERES A COST THEY CANT BEAR.
YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF TROOPS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO SPEND JULY 4th WITH THEIR FAMILIES WHO NOR LONGER GOING TO SPEND JULY 4th WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS MEANT IN TERMS OF SYMBOLISM.
THE UNITED STATES WAS BORN OF A FEAR OF A STANDING ARMY.
THE FOURTH OF JULY HAS NEVER BEEN A MILITARY CELEBRATION.
ITS A CELEBRATION OF POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE IDEALS OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN THIS TRADITIONALLY AMERICAN WAY.
ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE NORTH KOREA OR THE SOVIET UNION.
AND THATS WHAT TRUMP SET UP HERE.
THATS A GREAT POINT ABOUT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS AND THE WAY THEY ENVISIONED THIS HOLIDAY AND WHAT FREEDOM AT THE TIME FROM ENGLAND MEANT.
THERES A GREAT QUOTE WHERE THE LATE HUMORIST TALKED ABOUT FOURTH OF JULY IS ABOUT POTATO SALAD AND HOT DOGS AND ISNT IT GREAT WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY WE DONT HAVE TO HAVE A PARADE WITH GUNS AND TROOPS AND TANKS AND THE PATRIOT TRUE PATRIOTISM ON THIS DAY IS FEELING THAT  LIKE YOUVE EATEN TOO MUCH.
THATS FREEDOM.
JOHN McCAIN THERES A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THATS GOING TO PRINT OUT SHIRTS THAT FEATURE THE USS JOHN McCAIN.
WHATS YOUR TAKE ON THE SYMBOLISM OF THAT?
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT ARE SUPPORTING HIM.
AS YOULL RECALL THERE WAS THIS MISSION ACCOMPLISHED MOMENT DURING THE VISIT TO JAPAN WHERE THE USS JOHN McCAIN WAS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO HAVE ITS NAME HIDDEN AND ITS SAILORS WERENT INVITED TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
I THINK THATS AGAIN A WAY OF POKING BACK AT THE PRESIDENT.
AGAIN ITS A DAY WHERE WE CELEBRATE OUR FREEDOMS INCLUDING FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION.
THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD JUST HAVE TRUMP GO GOLFING.
THATS WHAT PRESIDENTS ACTUALLY DO ON JULY 4th.
THEY GO GOLF.
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT DAY TO DO IT.
NOT TO GET INVOLVED.
SIT IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHICH USED TO HAVE A GREAT VIEW OF THE FIREWORKS AND LEAVE THIS A CELEBRATION FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVES AND REPORTING TODAY.
COMING UP NEXT HISPANIC CAUCUS CHAIR JOAQUIN CASTRO JOIN S ME TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE WITNESSED DURING A TOUR OF A BORDER FACILITY.
ONE OF THE WOMEN SAID THAT SHE WAS TOLD BY AN AGENT TO DRINK WATER OUT OF THE TOILET.
THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS  THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
THESE ARE THE INHUMANE CONDITIONS THAT FOLKS ARE FACING.

Nothing!
i Theyre completelyi i different people.i Thats why they make customized car insurance from Liberty Mutual.

Yes and they could save a ton.
Youve done it again LiMu.
 LiMu grunts  i Only pay for what you need.i i  Liberty Libertyi i Liberty Liberty i AT THIS HOUR NATIONWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE UNDER WAY WITH PROTESTERS DEMANDING THE CLOSURES OF DETENTION FACILITIES HOLDING MIGRANT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.
ADVOCACY GROUPS ORGANIZED MORE THAN 150 DEMONSTRATIONS SOME OUTSIDE OF CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OFFICES WHILE OTHERS GATHERED OUTSIDE OF DETENTION FACILITIES.
THE PROTESTS FOLLOW REPORTS OF POOR CONDITIONS INSIDE SOME MIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES IN TEXAS.
AND VISITS TO THOSE FACILITIES BY DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS JUST YESTERDAY.
THIS AS CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION HAS LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION FOLLOWING A PROPUBLICA REPORT EXPOSING A SECRET FACEBOOK GROUP OF FORMER AND CURRENT BORDER PATROL.
IN IT MEMBERS REPORTEDLY MOCKED THE DEATH OF MIGRANTS AND POSTED SEXIST MEMES.
NBC NEWS HAS NOT VERIFIED THE FACEBOOK GROUP OR SEEN THE POSTS.
JOINING ME NOW MSNBC CORRESPONDENT GABE GUTIERREZ.
YOURE IN EL PASO I UNDERSTAND SPEAKING WITH PEDIATRICIANS THAT HAVE TREATED MIGRANT CHILDREN RELEASED FROM CUSTODY.
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU ABOUT HOW THESE KIDS ARE DOING?
HI THERE KASIE.
WERE HERE OUTSIDE OF ENUNCIATION HOUSE.
WEVE BEEN COMING TO THIS SHELTER FOR THE PAST YEAR OR SO SINCE THE FAMILY SEPARATION CRISIS OF LAST YEAR.
AND THEY DEAL WITH A LOT OF MIGRANTS.
THEY TAKE IN A LOT OF MIGRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROCESSED BY CBP AND I.C.E.
THEY END UP IN THIS SHELTER BEFORE THEYRE SENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AWAITING ASYLUM PROCEEDINGS.
THEYVE GONE FROM TAKING ABOUT 1000 MIGRANTS A DAY NOW TO ABOUT 100 150.
WERE ALSO SPEAKING WITH SOME OF THE PEDIATRICIANS TREATING THESE CHILDREN INCLUDING DR. LISA RODRIGUEZ.
YOURE A LOCAL PEDIATRICIAN AND YOU ARE TREAT SOMETHING OF THESE CHILDREN VERY YOUNG CHILDREN WHILE THEYRE IN CBP CUSTODY AND THEN AFTERWARD.
WHAT YOUR SEEING?
WEVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN WHO WHILE ARE IN CBP CUSTODY IF THEY NEED TO BE HOSPITALIZED THEY GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND WE CARE FOR THEM.
OR IF AFTER THEY ARE DISCHARGED FROM CBP CUSTODY IF THEY NEED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WE TAKE CARE OF THEM AS WELL.
WE SEE A LOT OF COMMON CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES IN THIS POPULATION.
A LOT OF UNFLUENZA STOMACH BUGS.
THE POPULATION IS UNIQUE IN THAT THEY GET A LITTLE BIT SICKER BECAUSE THEYRE ALREADY A LITTLE COMPROMISED.
THEYRE DEHYDRATED.
THEIR NUTRITION ISNT AS EXPECTED.
SO THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE SICKER FASTER.
WHEN WE TOURED THE CLINT TEXAS BORDER PATROL STATION LAST WEEK WE WERENT ALLOWED TO TALK TO ANY CHILDREN.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE BEEN THERE AND TELLING STORIES OF THEIR COMMUNICATION WITH THESE CHILDREN.
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM PARENTS CHILDREN.
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING THAT TROUBLES YOU?
YEAH I OFTEN TALK TO THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN IN CBP CUSTODY AND ASK THEM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THEIR TIME THERE HAS BEEN LIKE.
MOST RECENTLY I MET A YOUNG MOM WHO HAD A NEWBORN BABY.
AND WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF KEEPING HER LITTLE NEWBORN WARM.
SO THEY HAD GIVEN HER A PLASTIC BLANKET AND THE BABY WAS IN A ONESIE BUT SNUGGLE WITH THE BABY AND I JUST COULDNT KEEP THE BABY WARM DESPITE WHATEVER I DID I COULDNT KEEP MY BABY WARM.
TALKED ABOUT THE HANDS AND FEET BEING BLUE.
THATS JUST A SIMPLE BASIC HUMAN NEED THAT CONCERNED ME.
THANK YOU DR. RODRIGUEZ.
BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOUR OPINION SHOULD CHILDREN THIS YOUNG BE KEPT IN THESE TYPES OF HOLDING FACILITIES?
NO CHILDREN SHOULD BE IN A HOLDING FACILITY.
THEY NEED ACCESS TO THEIR BASIC NEEDS.
IF THEIR CHILD IS SICK THEY NEED ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE BY A TRAINED PEDIATRIC PROFESSIONAL.
REALLY ITS NOT A PLACE FOR ANY KID TO BE.
THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR SPEAKING WITH US.
THIS THE ONGOING SITUATION DOWN HERE ON THE BORDER.
EARLIER AT THE BORDER PATROL STATION IN CLINT TEXAS.
THAT CONTROVERSY FOLLOWING THE PROPUBLICA REPORT.
THIS APPEARS TO BE A DEBATE WITH NO END IN SIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR ABOUT AN INFANT SO COLD THEIR HANDS AND FEET TURN BLUE.
WHEN THE DELEGATION OF DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS TOURED THOSE MIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS ALONG THE BORDER THEY WERE TOLD TO SURRENDER THEIR DEVICES BEFORE THEYD BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE FACILITIES.
BUT CONGRESSMAN JOAQUIN CASTRO OF TEXAS WAS ABLE TO SNEAK A PHONE IN WITH THE CONSENT OF THE WOMEN IN CUSTODY CASTRO FILMED THEIR SMALL CELL WHICH INCLUDED A TOILET BUT NO RUNNING WATER.
HE POSTED THE IMAGES ON TWITTER SAYING MANY SAID THEY HAD NOT BATHED FOR 15 DAYS.
SOME HAD BEEN SEPARATED FROM CHILDREN.
SOME HAD BEEN HELD FOR MORE THAN 50 DAYS.
SEVERAL COMPLAINED THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED THEIR MEDICATION.
JOINING ME NOW TEXAS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN JOAQUIN CASTRO.
IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY.
HAVING ME.
I WANT TO START WITH THE BASICS HERE.
I THINK ITS HARD FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS TO WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND THE IDEA THAT YOU AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REGARDLESS OF WHAT PARTY YOU MAY BELONG TO ARENT ABLE TO GO INTO FACILITIES OUR GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR AND ACTUALLY DOCUMENT WHAT YOU SEE.
WHAT DID IT TAKE FOR YOU TO GET YOUR PHONE INTO THIS FACILITY SO THAT THOSE IMAGES COULD GET OUT THERE?
I JUST KEPT IT IN MY POCKET WHEN THEY TOLD US TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE.
WE ASKED THEM REPEATEDLY.
WE CHALLENGED THEM AND ASKED THEM WHAT LAW ALLOWS THEM TO FORCE US TO KEEP OUR PHONES AND CAMERAS AWAY FROM THE FACILITY.
AND THE BORDER PATROL CHIEF THERE COULDNT GIVE US AN ANSWER.
THERE WAS A LAWYER THERE AND SHE COULDNT GIVE US AN ANSWER.
AND SO AT THAT POINT AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO TRY TO KEEP LEGISLATORS WHO ARE ENTRUSTED WITH OVERSIGHT OF THEIR AGENCY FROM DOCUMENTING WHAT THEY SEE.
PARTICULARLY GIVEN WHATS AT STAKE AND GIVEN WHATS GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
SO WHAT IN YOUR VIEW COULD POSSIBLY BE THE EXPLANATION?
I THINK IT STRIKES A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THEY SIMPLY DONT WANT ANYONE TO FIND OUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON.
AND I THINK THAT THATS RIGHT.
I THINK THEYRE SCARED.
THAT THE REASON THINGS DONT CHANGE THE WAY THEY SHOULD IS BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE KEPT SECRET.
FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS A POINT AT WHICH WE WERE IN ONE OF THE TENTS THAT WAS EMPTY.
THEYD ALREADY MOVED EVERYBODY OUT.
THESE ARE DARK TENTS WITH CHAIN LINK FENCES.
WHEN THE SURGE HAPPENED THEY HAD YOU KNOW MAYBE 100 200 PEOPLE IN THERE.
AND THEY HAD SAID YOU CANT TAKE PICTURES BECAUSE YOU CANT VIOLATE THE PRIVACY OF THESE CHILDREN.
AND SO WE SAID OKAY.
WELL THIS TENT IS EMPTY.
THERES NOBODY IN HERE.
CAN WE TAKE A PHOTO OF THE TENT.
THEY SAID NO.
IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.
THEYRE TRYING TO KEEP EVERYTHING SECRET.
SO THEY ARE OF COURSE PUSHING BACK ON SOME OF THE CLAIMS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THESE WOMEN THAT YOU SHOW IN YOUR VIDEO AND FROM OTHERS THAT YOU SPOKE TO.
DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON NOT TO BELIEVE WHAT THESE MIGRANT DETAINEES TOLD YOU?
I DONT.
THEY SPOKE SINCERELY.
THERE WAS A POINT WHERE ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAS CUBAN SHE SPOKE SOME ENGLISH.
AND IN FRONT OF ALL OF US MANY OF THE LEGISLATORS AND ALSO SEVERAL CBP OFFICERS SHE CHALLENGED THEM VERY DIRECTLY AND SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE STANDARD OF CARE AND THE TREATMENT.
AND SHE SAID THAT SOME OF THE AGENTS HAD USED DEROGATORY WORDS LANGUAGE AGAINST THE WOMEN.
NOW IM NOT SAYING THAT SHE SAID THAT ALL OF THE AGENTS DID THAT.
BUT SHE SAID THAT IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE A FEW OF THEM HAD.
SO SHE VERY DIRECTLY CHALLENGED THEM IN FRONT OF ALL OF US.
AND THATS ONE OF THE REASONS THESE WOMEN WERE SCARED OF RETRIBUTION.
BUT IF THERES A DISPUTE ABOUT WHAT THE TRUTH IS IN THOSE FACILITIES THEN I THINK THERES A VERY EASY WAY TO SOLVE THAT.
THEY HAVE CAMERAS UP IN ALL OF THOSE ROOMS.
THEY CAN SIMPLY PUT OUT THE VIDEO FROM ALL THOSE CAMERAS AND THEY CAN LET THE PRESS DO THEIR JOBS AND GO INSIDE THERE AND THE PRESS CAN BE THE TIEBREAKER ABOUT WHATS GOING ON.
SO THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOOTAGE OF WHATS GONE ON IN THESE FACILITIES?
THEYVE BEEN VIDEOTAPING?
ALL OF THIS IS ON CAMERA AND YET WE AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC JUST CANT SEE IT?
YEAH LOOK THEY KNEW I WAS TAKING A PICTURE OF THOSE FOLKS.
THEY KNEW THAT I PULLED MY CAMERA OUT.
IM SURE SOMEBODY WAS WATCHING ME IN THAT ROOM.
I SAW THE OVERHEAD CAMERA RIGHT THERE.
THERE WERE PROBABLY FIVE AGENTS THAT WERE WATCHING THAT.
SO THEY HAVE FOOTAGE OF ALL OF THAT.
SO TO PICK UP ON ANOTHER POINT THAT YOU WERE MAKING.
YOU SAID IN THIS FACILITY THERE WERE BORDER PATROL AGENTS OR PERSONNEL THAT HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF BEHAVING FRANKLY IN A WAY THATS NOT BECOMING OF PEOPLE WHO WEAR A UNIFORM IN THE UNITED STATES OF THE UNITED STATES.
THERES ALSO BEEN PROPUBLICA REPORTING ON A SECRET FACEBOOK GROUP THAT MANY BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND FORMER AGENTS ARE A MEMBER OF WHERE THEY HAVE SAID SOME DESPICABLE THINGS ALLEGEDLY AND THAT THERES NOW AN INVESTIGATION GOING ON.
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN BE MAKING THESE TYPE OF COMMENTS AND BE TREATING PEOPLE THIS WAY?
WELL THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THOSE VERY DIRECT COMMENTS ABOUT SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ENTRUSTED IN THEIR CARE THEY ARE DESENSITIZED TO THE POINT OF BEING DANGEROUS TO THE MIGRANTS AND ALSO TO THEIR COWORKERS.
AND THEY NEED TO BE RELIEVED OF DUTY.
THEY REALLY SHOULD NOT BE WEARING ANY UNIFORM THAT REPRESENTS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
AND ALSO THE AGENTS THAT WERE ON THERE THAT DID NOT TURN THOSE PEOPLE IN NEED TO BE DEALT WITH AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN SOME WAY ALSO.
DO YOU TAKE ANY ISSUE WITH HOW YOUR DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN CONGRESS HANDLED THE RECENT FUNDING BILL TO TRY AND HELP ALLEVIATE THIS CRISIS?
THE MONEY THAT ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO BE SPENT AS PART OF THAT BILL DOESNT HAVE SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT DEMOCRATS WANTED.
MANY PROGRESSIVES WERE VERY ANGRY ABOUT HOW THAT ALL PLAYED OUT.
DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOUR LEADERSHIP ACTED IN BAD FAITH AND ARE YOU GIVING DID CONGRESS GIVE TOO MUCH TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS THEY CLAIM THAT THEYRE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS?
WELL I THINK THEY MOSTLY RAN UP AGAINST A BUZZSHAW OF MITCH McCONNELL AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO DONT CARE VERY MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE IN THOSE DETENTION CENTERS.
THERES NO QUESTION THAT WE NEEDED STRONGER SAFEGUARDS OR GUARDRAILS AROUND THAT MONEY SO THAT IT CANT BE TRANSFERRED OUT AND AWAY FROM HUMANITARIAN AID.
AND ALSO WE ALSO NEEDED NOT JUST TO PUMP A BUNCH MORE CASH INTO THESE FACILITIES.
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE PASSED THROUGH SOME OF THE WALKWAYS WE SAW STACKS OF GRANOLA BARS.
I LOOKED AT ANOTHER CELL AND THERE WAS A FAMILY EATING RAMEN HUDDLED ON THE FLOOR EATING RAMEN NOODLES.
ITS NOT JUST ABOUT MORE CASH FOR THEM TO BUY RAMEN NOODLES AND GRANOLA BARS.
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE MEDICAL STANDARDS AND ALSO THE STANDARDS OF CARE AND TREATMENT.
AND UNFORTUNATELY IN THAT SENATE BILL THAT FINALLY PASSED THERE ISNT ENOUGH OF THAT.
WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB.
TEXAS CONGRESSMAN JOAQUIN CASTRO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.
I APPRECIATE IT.
COMING UP NEXT THE PRESIDENTS QUEST TO NOT BE FORGOTTEN.
N. the worst... ...especially when your easily distracted teenager has the car.
At Subaru were taking on distracted driving PING with sensors that alert you when your eyes are off the road.
The allnew Subaru Forester.

USUALLY TO HIMSELF.
HE WAS AS HE WAS IN A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH FOX NEWS TUCKER CARLSON.
A LOT OF PEOPLE GAVE ME A LOT OF CREDIT.
THE PUBLIC WAS ON YOUR SIDE IF SURE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS A GREAT PRESIDENTIAL MOMENT.
I WON.
THEY WERE TOTALLY AGAINST ME.
I WON.
I HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON TWITTER.
A POLL CAME OUT TODAY.
IM AT 54 55 AND THEY SAY YOU CAN ADD 10 TO WHATEVER POLL I HAVE.
AND YET I WON.
AND I WON AGAIN.
THEY DO?
THAT WAS TAPED DURING TRUMPS TRIP TO ASIA WHEN HE BECAME THE FIRST SITTING MOMENT TO STEP INTO NORTH KOREA.
THE PRESIDENT ALREADY THINKS THAT IT DID.
HE TOLD REPORTERS HIS PRESIDENCY WAS QUOTE THE HOTTEST SHOW IN TOWN.
THE NEW YORK TIMES PETER BAKER WROTE ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS QUEST FOR SUPERLATIVES SAYING WHATEVER HE IS DOING MUST BE THE FIRST THE MOST THE BIGGEST AND IT SHAPES HIS POLICY CHOICES EVEN AS HE FRAMES HIS OWN NARRATIVE WITH THE BRANDING SKILLS OF A CAREER IN BUSINESS AND ENTERTAINMENT.
JOINING ME IS MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST PETER BAKER.
PETER I JUST SAW YOUR TWEET A COUPLE MINUTES BEFORE WE CAME ON THE AIR THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE NEWS CONFERENCE THE PRESIDENT USED BEST NINE TIMES INCREDIBLE 16 TIMES TREMENDOUS 28 TIMES AND GREAT OR GREATEST 50 TIMES.
KUDOS WHO WHOEVER WENT THROUGH AND COUNTED UP ALL OF THOSE WORDS.
WITH THE REALITY HERE SOMETIMES HELL MAKE STATEMENTS THAT ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE IN THE INTEREST OF TAKING YOU KNOW PRESENTING HIMSELF IN THE WAY THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT.
YEAH LOOK.
THIS IS A SALESMAN.
WHAT HIS HISTORY IS.
HES AN ENTERTAINER AND I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT REPETITION AND SELLING UP SELLING IN EFFECT WORKS.
AND IF THE FACTS ARE INCONVENIENT OR GET IN THE WAY YOU JUST EITHER IGNORE THEM OR REWRITE THEM.
AND IN THIS CASE HE HAS THE BEST ECONOMY EVER.
HE HAS THE STRONGEST PRESIDENT EVER THE BEST NEGOTIATION EVER.
DEAL EVER.
AND THIS HAS AN IMPACT.
IT DOES IN FACT CREATE A NARRATIVE OUT THERE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE WITH EVEN IF OTHERS ARE SORT OF SPINNING MAD BECAUSE HES KIND OF PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE WITH THE FACTS.
YOU KNOW HE CLEARLY WANTS TO BE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS.
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE GOES TO THE DMZ AND WALKS ACROSS THAT LINE INTO NORTH KOREA BECAUSE HE WAS TOLD NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAD DONE IT BEFORE.
ITS A FIRST.
HE LIKES TO BE SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE THE FIRST.
BROKEN A BARRIER AND DONE SOMETHING THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE.
THE QUESTION IS YOU JUST PUT IT CORRECTLY DOES THIS MEAN SOMETHING MORE ENDURING?
AND THATS THE UNANSWERED QUESTION.
AND IN THAT INTERVIEW WITH TUCKER CARLSON PETER FIRST OF ALL I THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING SHALL WE SAY THAT CARLSON WAS ON THE TRIP ACTING AS A DE FACTO FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER WHILE HIS OWN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER WAS OFF IN MONGOLIA.
BUT SETTING THAT ASIDE THERE WERE SOME INTERESTING  INTERESTING SHALL WE SAY ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS CARLSON POSED.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU HIS ANSWER ON HOMELESSNESS SPECIFICALLY AND THEN WELL TALK ABOUT IT.
LETS TAKE A LOOK.
IN NEW YORK CITY SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES THEYVE GOT A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH  ITS VERY SAD.
WITH FILTH.
ITS VERY SAD.
WHY IS THAT?
ITS A PHENOMENA THAT STARTED TWO YEARS AGO.
ITS DISGRACEFUL.
I AM GOING TO MAYBE AND IM LOOKING TAT VERY SERIOUSLY.
YOU KNOW I HAD A SITUATION WHEN I FIRST BECAME PRESIDENT.
WE HAD CERTAIN AREAS OF WASHINGTON D.C. WHERE THAT WAS STARTING TO HAPPEN AND I ENDED IT QUICKLY.
WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS OF THE WORLD COMING IN TO SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEY CANT BE LOOKING AT THAT.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT HURTS OUR COUNTRY.
SO PETER NOT ONLY IS HE SAYING IN ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS PHENOMENON WHERE HE SOLVED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS.
HE REMOVED HOMELESS PEOPLE SO OTHER LEADERS WOULDNT SEE THEM.
BUT ALSO SAID THIS IS A PHENOMENON THAT ONLY STARTED TWO YEARS AGO.
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
YEAH WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT TODAY.
WEVE BEEN SCOURING YOU KNOW FOX AND SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES HE GETS HIS INFORMATION FROM TO SEE IF HES REACTING TO SOMETHING SPECIFIC.
AND ITS HARD TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY.
OBVIOUSLY HOMELESSNESS DID NOT JUST START TWO YEARS AGO.
NO QUESTION THERES BEEN YOU KNOW AN UP TICK IN SOME PLACES.
IN FACT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THIS.
ITS BEEN A BIG ISSUE IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR.
HE OF COURSE YOU KNOW BUT HE SEES IT NOT AS A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE THE WAY HE FRAMES IT IN THAT INTERVIEW AS WELL.
ITS A PUBLIC RELATIONS ISSUE.
ITS AN ISSUE YOU DONT WANT WORLD LEADERS TO SEE AND THEREFORE YOU WANT TO GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY.
NOT TO MAKE SURE THEYRE GETTING CARE OR TO GET THEM INTO HOMES BUT TO MAKE SURE THEYRE NOT VISIBLE FOR VISITING LEADERS.
THATS A STRIKING FRAMEWORK ON HIS PART.
BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT.
HE SAID TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN ISSUE AND HE SNAPS HIS FINGER AND SUDDENLY ITS GONE.
I LIVE IN WASHINGTON.
ITS HARD TO KNOW WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE HERE FOR A LONG TIME.
HASNT CHANGED SPECIFICALLY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.
IF ANYTHING ITS GOTTEN TO BE ONE OF OUR MORE VISIBLE PROBLEMS.
PETER BAKER THANK YOU.
ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE WESTERN LIBERALISM QUESTION DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE.
WE WERE ALL A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY THE PRESIDENTS INTERPRETATION OF YOUR QUESTION BUT THANK YOU FOR ASKING IT.
AND THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY.
COMING UP NEXT AS THE FIELD OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DEBATE CLIMATE CHANGE REMAINS A TOP ISSUE AMONG PRIMARY VOTERS.
BUT HOW DOES THE COUNTRY BALANCE CONCERNS OVER THE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE NEED FOR JOBS AND REVENUE FROM INDUSTRIES LIKE COAL?
NBCS CAL PERRY TRAVELED TO MONTANA TO FIND OUT.
CAL THIS IS REALLY THE CENTRAL QUESTION AS WE KIND OF TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS AS A COUNTRY AND AS WE FRANKLY FAIL TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS AS A COUNTRY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON THESE OLD INDUSTRIES FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND MAKING THAT TRANSITION IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.
YOU TALKED TO ONE CANDIDATE WHO DIDNT MAKE THE DEBATE STAGE ABOUT ALL OF THIS.
YOURE NAILING THE ISSUE.
ITS A DIFFICULT BALANCE ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE LIKE MONTANA.
WE WENT OUT THERE.
SPENT TIME WITH THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BULLOCK.
HES TRYING TO DO THAT WALK THAT FINE LINE IN AN INDUSTRY AND STATE THAT STILL RELIES ON FOSSIL FUELS.
TAKE A LOOK.
IM JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZED AT THE BIG OPEN SKIES.
EVERYTHING THAT WERE SEEING AROUND US IS JUST ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULLY CARVED.
ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO COME HERE WAS JUST ENJOY THE PARK BUT TELL PEOPLE THIS PLACE MATTERS.
THESE PLACES ARE SET ASIDE TO BE BECAUSE THEYRE SPECIAL.
THESE PLACES ARE CHANGING AND CHANGING FAST.
ITS GORGEOUS.
AND WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE RECEDING GLACIERS.
WHILE TEMPERATURES ARE ON THE RISE ACROSS MONTANA MONTANA IS WARMING TWICE AS FAST.
TAKE ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENTS OWN CLIMATE ASSESSMENT.
THE STATE IS HOME TO TINY COOL TOWNS WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY PROVIDED THE COUNTRY WITH NEEDS AN AREA WITH TREASURED NATURAL WONDERS.
ANY TIME YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE AND POLITICS IN AMERICA GLACIER NATIONAL PARK HAS TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION.
THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 150 GLACIERS HERE IN 1850.
TODAY THERES ONLY 25.
FEWER DAYS BELOW FREEZING AND MORE ABOVE 90 DEGREES IS CHANGING THE STATE.
LESS SNOWFALL AND EARLIER MELT EACH YEAR MEANS MORE FIRES.
THEYRE BIGGER AND BURNING LONGER.
PROFESSOR DIANA SIKS.
WE ARE JUST SEEING A LOT OF FIRES NOW.
DAN FAYE MEASURES THE DISAPPEARING GLACIERS FOR THE U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.
HIS FIELD OF CHANGE IS WIDENING.
WHEN YOU HAVE CHANGES LIKE THIS THEY TEND TO CASCADE THROUGH THE SYSTEM.
THE SAME THINGS MELTING THE GLACIERS ARE CAUSING CHANGES IN FOREST FIRE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY.
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SAYS THEY DONT LOSE SLEEP ABOUT THIS I CERTAINLY DO.
MONTANA GOVERNOR STEVE BULLOCK IS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO BALANCE THE REALITIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN A STATE WITH AN ENERGY INDUSTRY THAT DEPENDS ON COAL ALL THE WHILE DOING IT WHILE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
AS WE MAKE TRANSITIONS WE CANT BE LEAVING COMMUNITIES BEHIND.
THERE ARE FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW THEYVE WORKED THEIR WHOLE LIFE POWERING THIS COUNTRY AND AT TIMES AND DEMOCRATS AND OTHERS TRY TO MAKE THEM INTO THE VILLAINS.
FOR SMALL TOWNS LIKE COOL STRIP MONTANA ANY DISCUSSION OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT REVENUE AND JOBS.
THE PLANT BEHIND ME IS WITHIN CITY LIMITS.
BETWEEN THAT AND A COAL MINE OFFICIALS HERE SAY IT ACCOUNTS FOR 90 OF THE TOWNS REVENUE.
TWO BUILDINGS AT COOL STRIP POWER PLANT IN OPERATION SINCE THE MID 70s WILL SHUT DOWN JUST A WEEK AFTER CHRISTMAS.
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A DROP IN REVENUE LOCALLY.
Reporter LAURA SHAW IS A FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER.
SHES ALSO THE FOUNDER OF COOL STRIP UNITED A PROCOOL ADVOCACY GROUP.
WHEN A TOWN A STATE A COMMUNITY IS WHOLLY RELIANT ON ONLY ONE OR TWO INDUSTRIES THAT MAKES US VULNERABLE.
I THINK WE SHOULD BE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DIVERSIFY AND BECOME MORE RESILIENT.
Reporter EVEN WHILE FACED WITH CERTAIN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE MANY HERE WANT PEOPLE OUTSIDE MONTANA TO KNOW THEY UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT BALANCE.
WERE NOT JUST LIKE A BUNCH OF NATUREHATING MONSTERS YOU KNOW.
WE HAVE OUR LIVES HERE AND WE HAVE FAMILIES.
I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT BUT WHAT PEOPLE DONT GET IS COAL GOT US WHERE WE ARE.
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.
WE MIGHT BE NOT LEAVING ANYTHING FOR OUR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN IF WERE NOT CAREFUL SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT.
WE HAVE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW ACTUALLY ARE AT THE POINT NOW IN A COUNTRY WHERE MAYBE IT WAS LIP SERVICE 30 YEARS AGO BUT IF WERE NOT TAKING IMMEDIATE AND DURABLE ACTION NOW THE AMERICA WERE GOING TO GIVE AND THE WORLD THAT WERE GOING TO GIVE TO OUR KIDS AND GRAND KIDS ISNT GOING TO BE THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN.
CASEY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NOT ONLY DOESNT WANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THEYRE ACTIVELY TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM HAVING THE CONVERSATION INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
FOR THE DEMOCRATS PART THE DNC SAID THEYRE NOT HAVING A STANDALONE DEBATE ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
HOWEVER AS RACHEL MADDOW WOULD SAY WATCH THIS SPACE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THEYRE REDISCUSSING THAT AND THERE COULD BE A VOTE IN AUGUST.
SO WE MAY HAVE A CLIMATE CHANGE FORUM ON THE HORIZON CASEY.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY DECIDE IT IS SOMETHING THAT DESERVES THEY RECEIVED A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR SAYING HEY WE CANT SPEND AN ENTIRE EVENING TALKING ABOUT THIS WHEN OF COURSE IT IS SOMETHING THATS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY AFFECT ALL OF US.
CAL PERRY THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING.
IT LOOKED LIKE A FANTASTIC BEAUTIFUL TRIP TO MONTANA.
COMING UP NEXT A TENNIS PRODIGY TAKES DOWN A TENNIS TITAN WHO HAPPENS TO BE HER IDOL.
ONE MORE THING NEXT.
OL ONE MORE THING NEXT THING BEFORE WE GO.
MEET COREY COCO GAUFF.
SHES 15 YEARS OLD.
BORN IN ATLANTA SHE STARTED PLAYING TENNIS AT THE AGE OF 7 INSPIRED BY WHO ELSE?
VENUS AND SERENA WILLIAMS.
AFTER NOTICING SHE HAD A KNACK FOR IT ON THE COURT HER FAMILY MOVED TO FLORIDA TO GIVE HER BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN.
BY THE TIME CORI WAS 11 SHE HAD THE CHANCE TO TRAIN WITH SERENA WILLIAMS AS COACH IN FRANCE AND BY 14 SHE HAD WON HER FIRST MATCH AS A PROFESSIONAL.
JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER SHE WAS SIGNED BY NEW BALANCE.
DESPITE ACHIEVING SO MUCH IN HER SHORT 15 YEARS NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED HER FOR WHAT WAS TO COME.
FIRST CAME FRIDAY WHEN COCO BECAME THE YOUNGEST PERSON TO QUALIFY FOR THE MAIN DRAW AT WIMBLEDON.
SHE SAID RIGHT AFTERWARD THAT SHE HOPED THAT MAYBE SHE COULD PLAY AGAINST ONE OF HER IDOLS.
SO THEN CAME YESTERDAY.
SHE TOOK THE COURT AT WIMBLEDON AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NET SEVENTIME GRAND SLAM CHAMPION VENUS WILLIAMS COCOS DREAM COME TRUE TAKING ON ONE OF THE VERY WOMEN WHO INSPIRED HER TO PICK UP A RACKET IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THERE THEY WERE THE YOUNGEST AT WIMBLEDON COCO VERSUS THE ELDEST AT WIMBLEDON VENUS WILLIAMS 39 YEARS OLD.
NO ONE AND I MEAN NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED WHAT THIS 15YEAR OLD WOULD DO NEXT.
STANDING OVATION!
COCO GAUFF CONQUERS VENUS WILLIAMS.
JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
COCO BECOMING THE YOUNGEST PLAYER SINCE 1991 TO WIN IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE WOMENS TOURNAMENT.
A RISING STAR TAKING DOWN A TITAN IN STRAIGHT SETS COCO OVERCOME WITH EMOTION AS YOU WOULD EXPECT.
HER PARENTS BEAMING WITH PRIDE FROM THE STANDS.
SO WHAT DOES A TEEN STAR TELL HER IDOL AFTER BESTING HER IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD?
AFTER THE MATCH I TOLD HER THAT JUST THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING SHE DID.
I WOULDNT BE HERE IF IT WASNT
