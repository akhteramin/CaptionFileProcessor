WENDI NIX DIANNA RUSSINI VICTOR CRUZ AND MIKE TANNENBAUM AND WELL START WITH NEWS REGARDING IZZY GILL ELLIOTT.
THE DALLAS COWBOY RUNNING BACK EXPECTED TO MEET WITH THE COMMISSIONER TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY REGARDING A MAY INCIDENT IN LAS VEGAS.
THE MEETING COMES AFTER AN INCIDENT AT A LAS VEGAS MUSIC FESTIVAL WHERE HE HAD A CONFRONTATION WITH A SECURITY GUARD BRIEFLY DETAINED BUT NEVER ARRESTED OR CHARGED IN THE INCIDENT.
NEVERTHELESS THE COMMISSIONER WANTS TO HEAR HIM OUT.
DIANNA WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US.
AT THIS POINT WE DONT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT MEETING BUT THEY ARE MEETING IN MANHATTAN TO DISCUSS ZEKES BEHAVIOR IN THAT LAS VEGAS INCIDENT.
JERRY JONES OF COURSE HAS STOOD BY HIS RUNNING BACK SAYING THAT HE DOESNT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH WHAT HE SAW ON VIDEOTAPE AGAIN ZEKE IN THOSE HANDCUFFS AND THEN THOSE HANDCUFFS WERE REMOVED.
HE COULD STILL FACE PUNISHMENT IN GOODELL DECIDES HE VIOLATED THE LEAGUES PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY AND THATS WHAT THIS MEET SOMETHING TO DISCUSS.
BUT AS OF NOW WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT THE FUTURE HOLES BUT THOSE THAT IVE SPOKEN TO WITH THE COWBOYS ORGANIZATION STRONGLY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT ZEKE WILL NOT FACE A SUSPENSION IN THIS BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT.
MIKE AS A GM I KNOW YOU HAVE PLAYERS WHO HAD FACETOFACE MEETINGS WITH THE COMMISSIONER WHO HAD HEARINGS OR DUE DILIGENCE.
WHATS YOUR TAKE GENTLEMAN.
DESPITE HOW THE COWBOYS ARE FEELING A SUSPENSION CERTAINLY IS IN PLAY.
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER UNDER THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY A PLAYER CAN BE SUSPENDED EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY NOT BE CHRISMAN CHARGES AND THE FACT THAT EZEKIEL ELLIOTT IS MEETING IN PERSON WITH THE COMMISSIONER SIGNALS TO ME THAT A SUSPENSION ALBEIT ONE GAME TWO GAMES COULD BE IN PLAY HERE AND HE WAS SENT TO NEW YORK FOR A REASON SO WELL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT IN THE COMING DAYS BUT HIS PRIOR BEHAVIOR WILL CERTAINLY BE A FACTOR IN THEIR ASSESSMENT.
WELL LETS SHIFT GEARS TO BETWEEN THE LINES.
VICTOR HOW IMPORTANT IS THE RUN GAME TO THIS CURRENT DALLAS COWBOYS TEAM.
HUGE ESPECIALLY EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
HES BEEN THE FOCAL POINT OF THE OFFENSE YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT.
HANDING HIM THE FOOTBALL BEHIND THAT FANTASTIC OFFENSIVE LINE I MEAN HE IS IN MY OPINION THE HEARTBEAT OF THAT OFFENSE.
OBVIOUSLY DAK IS THE LEADER.
BUT EZEKIEL MAKES HIM GO.
YOU GOT THE PLAYACTION PASS AND EVERYTHING COMPLIMENTS THE ATTRIBUTES SO IF HES THERE TO MISS ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME THE COWBOYS WOULD BE LOOKING TO REPLACE THAT YOU KNOW THOSE STATISTICS AND NUMBERS THAT HE PUTS UP WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
YEAH AND VIC YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT DAK PRESCOTT HIS PASS RATING CHANGED SO YOU CAN SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RUNNING GAME EZEKIEL ELLIOTT OBVIOUSLY OPPOSING DEFENSES ARE FOCUSING IN ON STOPPING EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND THATS A VERY IMPACTFUL IN TERMS OF HIS IMPACT ON DAK PRESCOTTS PRODUCTION A HUGE JUMP IN TERMS OF HIS PLAY ACTION PRODUCTIVITY.
HUGE JUMP.
WELL TALK ABOUT DAKS DEAL AND WHEN IT MAY GET DONE.
THIS DLABS TEAM STACKS UP IN THE DIVISION.
I THINK THEYRE RIGHT THERE AT THE TOP.
I THINK THEYRE COMPETING OBVIOUSLY THEM AND PHILADELPHIA RIGHT THERE NECK AND NECK GOING TO BE BATTLING IT OUT THROUGHOUT THE SEASON BUT I THINK THEY GOT ALL THE TOOLS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM DEFENSIVELY FROM THE DEFENSIVE LINE BACK TO THE SECOND DRI THEYRE LOADED AT EACH POSITION AND THEN OFFENSIVELY LIKE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT DAK EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AMARI COOPER RANDALL COBB I COULD GO ON FOR DAYS WITH THIS BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE TALENT EXACTLY.
THEY GOT ALL OF THE TALENT NOT TO MENTION  NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
WHICH OBVIOUSLY COMES FROM YOU KNOW COLLEGE AND DOING THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS SO HELL PROVIDE SOME CREATIVITY THAT WE PROBABLY HAVENT SEEN FROM DIFFERENT TYPE OF PLAYS THAT WE HAVENT SEEN NECESSARILY FROM THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
YOURE NOT GOING WITH THE EAGLES YOURE GOING WITH THE DALLAS COWBOYS TO WIN THAT DIVISION.
YES UNFORTUNATELY NOBODY IN NEW YORK KILL ME.
THAT WAS VICTOR.
WHEN DOES DAKS DEAL GET DONE?
DO WE SEE THAT DONE BEFORE THE START OF THE SEASON?
I THINK THAT WILL GET DONE BEFORE THE START OF THE SEASON.
EVEN TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE COWBOYS ORGANIZATION ABOUT THE TIMING OF IT ITS FUNNY BECAUSE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE WAY IT WAS BEING EXPLAINED TO ME IT WAS GOING TO BE A WHILE.
IT WASNT GOING TO GET DONE AND NOW IT SEEMS THAT IM NOT SURE WHERE THE PRESSURE IS COMING FROM.
I DONT KNOW WHY THEYRE FEELING THE PRESSURE BUT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET IT DONE IT SEEMS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY.
THE PRESSURE COMES FROM WHAT DAKS DRAFT DAY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS IS NOW BECOMING THE REALITY OF A FREE AGENT OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT A FIRST ROUND PICK WHICH WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT HES IN THE FINAL YEAR OF HIT CONTRACT SO UNLIKE GUYS LIKE JARED GOFF AND CARSON WENTZ WHO HAD THE ADDITIONAL FIFTH YEAR HE COULD GET TO THE MARKET AND MAY NOT BE A PERFECT PLAYER.
IM A BELIEVE IN DAK PRESCOTT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE CAN DO FROM A PASSING STANDPOINT BUT THE PLAYS HE MAKES WITH HIS LEGS IF HE MADE IT TO THE OPEN MARKET THE WAY KIRK COUSINS DID A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HARD TO SAY WHAT HE CAN GET.
CERTAINLY GET FRAN CHRIST BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM AN ORGANIZATION STANDPOINT WHEN YOU USE THE FRANCHISE TAG THE LAST POSITION YOU WANT TO USE IT ON IS THE QUARTERBACK.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A FRANCHISE TAG THAT MEANS THAT THE PLAYER DOESNT HAVE TO BE THERE FOR THE OFFSEASON PROGRAM.
DOESNT HAVE TO BE THERE FOR TRAINING CAMP.
HE COULD COME IN THE TUESDAY BEFORE OPENING DAY SIGN THE TAG GET PAID FOR THE WHOLE SEASON AND IT REALLY PUTS THE OFFENSE AND ALL THOSE REPS YOU DONT HAVE TOGETHER VIC SO THE SENSE OF URGENCY IS COMING FROM THE FACT THAT THIS PLAYER IS 16 GAMES AWAY FROM BECOMING A FREE AGENT.
THAT QUARTERBACK ALSO FEELS THAT PRESSURE.
I MEAN THEY DONT EVER REALLY FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG.
WITH THE KIRK COUSINS SITUATION IN WASHINGTON.
HE WAS ALWAYS OUT THERE PROVING AND PROVING AND PROVING.
AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO HIM ABOUT IT AND YOU COULD TELL IT WAS  WEIGHS ON HIM.
IT WAS LIKE THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS ORGANIZATION WERE LOOKING TO DATE AND DATE AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A RING.
HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED AND FEEL THAT LOVE AND NEVER DID.
FOR THE COWBOYS TO PUT THAT ON DAK THAT MAY NOT WORK OUT FOR THEM YOU KNOW IF THEY WANT TO MAKE THAT WORK.
YOU KNOW WHAT HES MARRIED TO MONEY.
A LOT OF MONEY.
I AM NOT CRYING FOR KIRK COUSINS BUT IT IS A POINT WELL MADE.
ALL RIGHT.
ANYWAY CIRCLING BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED ZEKE ELLIOTT AND THE COWBOYS HOPING HE WILL NOT MISS ANY TIME.
VIDEO SHOWS BROWNS RUNNING BACA REAM HUNT BEING QUESTIONED BY POLICE AFTER AN APPARENT INCIDENT SATURDAY NIGHT.
THIS IS AT A CLEVELAND BAR.

THAT LIGHTS A FIRE UNDER MY BUTT AND PROBABLY GETS ME EXCITED TO TRY TO PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ABOUT IT.
Thats the only circumstance to which you would separate.

This is Caitlin Dickerson from The New York Times.

PRESS CONFERENCE FROM OUR OWN DAN GRAZIANO.
SOURCE AS CORDYING TO DAN CBA COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE NFL AND PLAYERS ASSOCIATION ARE EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY THIS SUMMER IN AN EFFORT TO GET A NEW DEAL DONE BY THE START OF THE 2019 SEASON.

FORMER PACKERS WIDE RECEIVER RANDALL COBB SIGNED BY THE COWBOYS IN FREE AGENCY TEAMED UP WITH AARON RODGERS FOR OVER 5000 RECEIVING YARDS AFTER BEING DRAFTED BY THE PACK IN HE WILL FACE HIS FORMER TEAM WEEK FIVE IN DALLAS AND HE HAD TO SAY THIS ABOUT MOVING ON FROM GREEN BAY.
ITS LIKE THE EXGIRLFRIEND THAT BREAK UP WITH YOU.
WHEN YOU SEE HER FIVE YEARS LATER YOU HOPE YOURE IN A BETTER SITUATION THAN YOU WERE BEFORE.
MARRIED WITH KIDS AND ABLE TO SAY YEAH I DID BETTER WITHOUT YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT HES RIGHT.
NOBODY SAYS THAT BUT THATS HOW EVERYBODY FEELS.
NOT EVERY BREAKUP HAS TO BE CONTENTIOUS.
I DONT CARE IF ITS THE BEST BREAKUP EVER.
LIFE WASNT SO GREAT  YOURE WINNING IM NOT.
YOU WANT TO WIN.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
ANYWAY THAT GOT US THINKING FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WHO IS BETTER OFF?
WE SAW A NUMBER OF NFL BREAKUPS IF YOU WILL SO FIVEYEAR MARK.
RANDALL COBB OR THE GREEN BAY PACKERS WHOCHLT IS BETTER OFF.
IM GOING WITH RANDALL.
HES JOINING A TEAM IN THE COWBOYS THATS A YOUNGER TEAM.
I THINK THEYRE AN OVERALL BETTER TEAM RIGHT NOW THAN THE GREEN BAY PACKERS BUT I THINK IN FIVE YEARS HELL BE IN THE PLAYOFFS A COUPLE OF TIMES.
HELL HES OBVIOUS IN THE MIX THAT HAVE WIDE RECEIVING CORE AND THAT SLOT POSITION IS IMPORTANT IN THE NFL NOWADAYS AND I THINK OVERALL HELL JUST BE BETTER.
DAK PRESCOTT HAS A BETTER QUARTERBACK.
THAT WILL SERVE HIM BETTER GIVEN THAT LONGEVITY AND BE THERE FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND BUILD THAT CAMARADERIE WITH DAK THAT WILL SERVE HIM.
HE WONT MISS AARON RODGERS AT ALL.
THEYRE A BETTER OVERALL TEAM.
FIVE YEARS.
A LOT CAN HAPPEN.
ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN THERE WERE NO IN MY OPINION NO MORE NOTABLE BREAKUP THAN THAT ONE BETWEEN ODELL BECKHAM JR. AND THE NEW YORK GIANTS.
THIS IS EASY IF YOURE TALKING ABOUT NOW.
BUT FIVE YEARS.
ODELL BECKHAM JR. IS GOING TO BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION.
HE GOT PAID TONS OF MONEY AND HAS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MORE MONEY.
PRICE OF LIVING IN CLEVELAND IS LOWER.
TAKKS ARE LOWER.
SO FROM A PERSONAL FINANCIAL STANDPOINT ODELL BECKHAM JR. IS WINNING BIG TIME BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FOOTBALL THERE IS NO QUARTERBACK THAT I BELIEVE HAS MORE POTENTIAL TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST THAN I BELIEVE IN WHAT BAKER MAYFIELD COULD DO IN TERMS OF THE CONTINUITY AND THE TEAM THEYRE BUILDING COMPARED TO NEW YORK.
WERE NOT SURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HAT SHURMUR IF HE WILL BE THERE.
HE COULD BE ON THE HOT SEAT IF IT DOESNT WORK.
IT SEEMS CLEVELAND IS A MUCH BETTER OFF PLACE FOR ODELL BECKHAM JR.
SO I THINK HES GOING TO LOOK BACK AND GO YOU KNOW WHAT THATS GOOD.
WHAT IS INTERESTING THE GIANTS HAD A COUPLE OF BREAKUPS.
LANDON COLLINS BETTER OFF IN FIVE YEARS.
ILL GO THE OTHER WAY.
THE NEW YORK GIANTS AND DAVE GETTLEMAN.
WHAT WE LOOK AT WHAT DMEFS DONE TO REHIM THEY ACQUIRED BETHEA AND PEPPERS THAT SENT ODELL BECKHAM TO CLEVELAND AND ALTHOUGH COLLINS IS A GOOD PLAYER I THOUGHT HE WAS MORE PRODUCTIVE CLOSER TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY PEPPERS PLAYS HE CAN REPLACE HIM.
SO ITS NOT FIVE YEARS WE KNOW WERE BETTER OFF WITHOUT LANDON.
WOW.
ALL RIGHT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
NOTED.
YOU KNOW SAID THERE WAS NO BIGGER BREAKUP THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT A.B.
AND THE STEELERS.
I WANT TO RETRACT THAT.
ANTONIO BROWN AND THE STEELERS.
THIS ONE I THINK IS TRICKY AGAIN TALKING ABOUT FIVE SEASONS OUT.
WHO IS BETTER OFF.
IM GOING WITH THE STEELERS.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE THE STEELERS ORGANIZATION AS A WHOLE WILL BE FULLY TURN THE PAGE FULLY FROM ANTONIO BROWN DRAMA AND BE LOOKING TO JUJU.
HELL BE TENURED A TRUE VETERAN LEADER ON THAT TEAM.
UNDERSTAND WHO HE IS.
BIG BEN WHO KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS HE HAS LEFT BUT WITH THAT BODY FRAME HE CAN STILL BE THERE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW PLAYING AT A HIGH LEVEL BUT THESE GUYS ARE READY TO PLAY AS A TEAM AS A PERSPECTIVE ONCE THEY GET RID OF THE DRAMA AND NEGATIVITY SURROUND THE TEAM WITH LeVEON BELL AND ALL OF THESE THINGS I THINK FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THIS TEAM WILL BE BETTER.
BEN ROETHLISBERGER WILL BE RELAXED AND THE TEAM WILL BE GOOD TO GO.
PERFECT SEGUE.
HOW ABOUT LeVEON BELL AND THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS.
I THINK WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF A PREVIEW LAST YEAR RIGHT?
BELL WAS A STEELER BUT HE REALLY WASNT.
SO WELL GO WITH THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS AND TALKING ABOUT JAMES CONNER WHO FILLED IN LAST YEAR FOR LeVEON BELL.
WE HAVE ANOTHER YEAR WITH HIM NOW IN THE OFFSEASON PROGRAM AND I THINK REALLY WHERE WERE GOING TO MISS BELL GUYS IS AS A RUSHER BUT A RECEIVER BUT JAMES CON CERRA A REALLY GOOD RUNNING BACK.
PRODUCTIVE BETWEEN TACKLES AND GOOD PASS PROTECTOR AND ANOTHER YEAR OF GOING INTO THE JOB I THINK PITTSBURGH YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT DOES A GREAT JOB OF LETTING GUYS MOVE ON AND REPLACING BELL AND AGREE WITH VICTOR AND THINK THEYLL REPLACE A.B.
AND REPLACE BELL VERY WELL WITH JAMES CONNER.
ALL RIGHT I DO THINK THAT TEAM HAS SORT OF RALLIED AROUND THE DEPARTURES.
THATS NOW.
WELL SEE WHERE THEY ARE IN A FEW SEASONS.
THIS LAST ONE IM NOT SURE THEY DATED.
I DONT KNOW.
THEY WENT OUT.
IT WAS A HOOKUP.
THE CARDINALS AND  I THINK JOSH ROSEN WILL BE BETTER OFF.
HE HAD THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ON HIS SHOULDERS.
HE WAS A TOP DRAFT PICK.
THE ANSWER TO THE ARIZONA CARDINALS ORGANIZATION.
OF COURSE THAT DIDNT WORK OUT SO HERE HE IS IN MIAMI NOW THE PRESSURE IS REALLY OFF.
HES GOT A NEW HEAD COACH HERE.
THEYRE GOING TO BE RUNNING A NEW ENGLAND SYSTEM.
BY THE WAY IF YOU RUN THE NEW ENGLAND OFFENSIVE SYSTEM YOU GOT TO BE A SMART GUY.
THATS WHAT JOSH ROSEN IS.
ELSES A SMART GUY AND I THINK HES GOING TO FIT IN WELL THERE AND IS GOING TO BE A PLACE  OH BY THE WAY HE HAS FITZPATRICK BEHIND HIM THAT DOESNT HAVE THE ATTITUDE OF A START THEIR DOESNT WANT TO HELP.
TWO SMART GUYS IN THE QUARTERBACK ROOM A MUCH BETTER PLACE FOR JOSH.
DIANNA WHAT ABOUT KYLER MURRAY?
YOU DONT THINK THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO BE A DYNAMIC PLAYMAKER  THATS WHAT THE QUESTION IS.
AN ASSESSMENT OF KYLER MURRAY IN A LOT OF WAYS.
THE BIG QUESTION MARK WILL IT WORK?
TO ME MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH ARIZONA IS LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR IS THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE SO AS MUCH AS WE CAN SAY KYLER MURRAY.
I GOT FIVE YEARS  THATS RIGHT.
LOOKING FOR A GM.
NO.
TRYING TO GET RID OF ME?
I GOT FIVE YEAR.
BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO.
YOU GAVE ME FIVE YEARS.
I DID.
FAIR ENOUGH.
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN WE COME BACK JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER ISNT THINKING FIVE YEARS.
HES THINKING RIGHT NOW AND WELL TALK ROLE MODELS AND STEELERS CULTURE COMING UP.
HI IM JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER AND WANT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH FUN IM HAVING THIS OFFSEASON.

SMITHSCHUSTER PAST MIDFIELD.
EXTRA POINT.
BY THE MAN CALLED JUJU.
JUJU JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER IN THE BACK OF THE END ZONE.
WOW.
WERE JOINED THIS AFTERNOON BY JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER WHO IS MAKING HIS WAY ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.
HE IS IN LONDON THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE NFL ACADEMY WHERE HES AN AMBASSADOR.
JUJU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS AND WHAT IT MEANS THERE IN LONDON.
SO HERE IN LONDON WERE WORKING WITH THE NFL ACADEMY WHICH IS AN AMAZING THING.
THEY GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAYERS YOUNG PLAYERS FROM THE AGE OF 15 AND UP YOU KNOW WHO LEARN THE NEW GAME AMERICAN FOOTBALL.
THIS IS NEW TO THEM WHICH IS AWESOME BUT ITS AWESOME BECAUSE IT JUST GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ANOTHER CAREER ANOTHER WAY TO PLAY IN THE STATES IN THE NFL.
WE TALKED TO JAMES CONNER YESTERDAY.
HE TALKED ABOUT TURNING THE PAGE.
ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT HAD GONE ON IN PITTSBURGH DURING THE OFFSEASON.
WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE OF THIS TEAM AS YOU GET READY FOR TRAINING CAMP?
WERE NOT TOO COLD.
HOT.
THE WEATHER IS NICE.
EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE.
FOCUS ON THE SAME GOAL WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE THATS WHAT WERE ALL ABOUT.
ABOUT THE TEAM.
THERES NO INDIVIDUALS AND HERE TO WIN GAMES.
JUJU TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE TALENT YOURE SEEING IN LONDON.
ANY BALLERS OUT THERE?
ANY FUTURE STEELERS OUT THIS OR WHAT?
MAN THERES SOME TALENT HERE.
THERES SOME POTENTIAL.
I MEAN YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND THIS GAME IS NEW TO THEM.
WE STARTED LIFTING WEIGHTS AT THEYRE BARELY STARTING AT 16 IF WERE TO GET THEM ON THE RIGHT PAGE IT WOULD BE AMAZING TO START A POP CARNER AND START IN MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AND THAT WOULD BE THEIR ACADEMY.
ALL RIGHT JUJU ITS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED THAT ANTONIO BROWN IS NO LONGER WITH THE STEELERS.
NOW YOURE THE NUMBER ONE GUY.
HOW DOES IT FEEL?
DO YOU FEEL A DIFFERENCE IN THE LOCKER ROOM?
ARE PEOPLE TREATING YOU DIFFERENTLY?
ARE DUDES GETTING YOUR TRAYS OF LUNCH FOR YOU?
IS IT A DIFFERENT FEELING BEING THE NUMBER ONE GUY?
HOW DOES IT FEEL?
NO MAN IT FEELS NO DIFFERENT.
I MEAN ALWAYS PEOPLE SAY OH YOURE THE NUMBER ONE GUY THIS YEAR BUT MORE FOR MYSELF I GIVE MYSELF MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHERS GUY TO STEP UP.
TALK ABOUT A.B.
HAVING A HUNDRED CATCHES OVER A THOUSAND YARDS.
THOSE WILL BE SPREAD OUT BETWEEN JAMES CONNER JAMES WASHINGTON DONTE MONCRIEF JAMES SAMUELS.
SO MANY GUYS WILL GET MORE TOUCHES MORE CATCHES MORE YAC.
IM THE STILL SAME GUY IN THE LOCKER ROOM.
THE 22YEAROLD VERSION OF JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER AND JUJU YOU REFERENCED THE FOOTBALL BEING SPREAD AROUND.
THAT MAKES THE COMMUNICATION WITH BEN ROETHLISBERGER ALL THAT MORE IMPORTANT.
WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH YOUR QUARTERBACK?
ITS AMAZING MAN.
BEN HES A GREAT LEADER.
GREAT DUDE.
HE TOOK THE WHOLE OFFENSIVE GROUP DOWN TO HIS HOUSE IN GEORGIA.
AMAZING YOU KNOW WE SPEND TIME TOGETHER.
BONDING WORKED HARD.
THREW.
AT THE END OF THE DAY ITS LIKE DURING THAT BONDING THAT CONNECTION AND WHAT HE DID FOR US WAS AMAZING.
I THINK ITS SO CRAZY THAT A GUY WHO HAS BEEN IN THE LEAGUE FOR 15 16 YEARS SEES SO MANY GUYS COME AND GO AND YOU KNOW FOR ME IM ONLY 22 YEARS OLD.
I MET HIM I WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND OUR BOND IS JUST WERE JUST GOING TO KEEP GROWING.
AS AN ATHLETE AS THE SUPERSTAR ATHLETE YOU ARE YOURE ALWAYS WORKING ON SOMETHING NEW.
GIVE ME ONE THING YOUVE BEEN WORKING ON TO EITHER GET BETTER AT OR SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO YOUR GAME OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE?
MAN I WANT TO REALLY REALLY FOCUS AND PLAY MORE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LEARNING THE WHOLE PACKAGE LEARNING THE WHOLE OFFENSE.
THATS WHAT SPATES BEING ON THE FIELD THE WHOLE GAME AND BEING ON THE FIELD CERTAIN PLAY CERTAIN PACKAGES.
I THINK ITS GREAT IM ABLE TO PLAY OUTSIDE INSIDE RIGHT SIDE LEFT SIDE.
YOU KNOW MOVEMENT AND ITS THE SAME THAT WILL HELP OUT A LOT AND THATS SOMETHING IVE BEEN FOCUSED ON STUDYING THAT PLAYBOOK AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT EVERYBODY HAS TO DO.
JUJU WE ALSO GET TO SEE EVERYTHING ELSE YOU DO VIA SOCIAL MEDIA.
DOES ANYBODY IN THE NFL HAVE MORE FUN THAN YOU DO?
NOT NECESSARILY.
I MEAN I DO A LOT OF STUFF ON YOUTUBE SO A LOT OF STUFF I DO ON THAT END.
I REALLY LOVE TO SHOW MY PERSONAL SIDE ON MY FUN SIDE WHAT I DO IN MY FREE TIME PLAYING AND MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS.
I THINK A LOT OF GUYS IN THE NFL JUST POST A LOT OF WORKING OUT WHICH IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT YOU KNOW BUT WHAT DO THEY LIKE TO DO IN THEIR FREE TIME?
DO THEY LIKE TO TRAVEL THE WORLD STAY HOME AND WATCH MOVIES.
I THINK A LOT OF THEIR FANS WOULD LIKE THAT.
SOME LIKE TO GO TO PROM WHICH APPARENTLY YOU DID RECENTLY.
TELL US ABOUT THE PROM.
SO THE PROM WAS AWESOME.
YOU KNOW A KID HES FROM P.A. PITTSBURGH.
IDEALLY HE WANTED TO TAKE THIS GIRL THAT HE LIKED A LOT AND HIS BEST FRIEND ENDS UP TAKING HER.
HE TOLD HIS BEST FRIEND BUT HIS WENT BEHIND HIS GIRL AND TOOK THIS GIRL SO HE ASKED ME MAN LETS ONEUP BUY A SUIT GET A PARTY BUS.
WE BASICALLY STOLE THE NIGHT AWAY FOR HIM AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I MET THE GUY.
HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD KID SO HES GREAT.
MY FRIEND IS GREAT BECAUSE HE GOT LIKE 20K FOLLOWERS ANTHONY SO HES SUPER EXCITED ABOUT HIS COLLEGE CAREER COMING SOON.
ANTHONY ONE FRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND NOTHING.
HE WINS.
JUJU WE SAW YOU GETTING BUSY ON THE DANCE FLOOR RIGHT THERE.
TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT CELEBRATIONS YOU GOT IN STORE.
I KNOW YOURE ALWAYS CREATIVE AND BRING NEW STUFF TO THE TABLE.
WHAT YOU GOT IN STORE FOR US THIS YEAR FROM THE CELEBRATION STANDPOINT?
MAN DONT LOOK.
IM SO EXCITED.
YES IM THE YOUNG DUDE IN THE ROOM BUT IM VOCAL.
ITS MY TIME TO STEP UP AND BE A LEADER AND GETTING EVERYBODY ON THE PAGE TO DO A CELEBRATION.
DONTE MONCRIEF IS OLDER BUT ALL THESE GUYS MY RECEIVERS JAMES WASHINGTON IS ON THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE WERE IN THE SAME CLASS AND THEN IM STILL WORKING ON BIG BEN YOU KNOW AND THE OLINEMEN.
THEY ARE A LOT OLDER SO THEYRE VETS.
BEEN HERE BEFORE.
WELL FIGURE IT OUT.
MAJOR CELEBRATION COMING SOON.
WE CANT WAIT.
LAST QUESTION WE ASKED JAMES CONNER THIS YESTERDAY TO CLOSE THINGS OUT.
WHY SHOULD STEELER FANS BE OPTIMISTIC AS WE LOOK TOWARDS MAN YOU KNOW STEELER FANS ARE ALWAYS SUPPORTING US SINCE DAY ONE WHETHER WE DO BAD OR GOOD.
I DONT DOUBT THEYLL SUPPORT US TO THE END.
IM KIND OF HAPPY LIKE WHERE WERE AT RIGHT NOW WERE NOT LIKE THE HEADLINE THE BROWNS THEYRE THE TEAM THAT EVERYONE IS WATCHING WHAT KIND OF NOISE THEYLL MAKE.
IM SUPER EXCITED TO WATCH THEM PLAY TOO.
SEEING OBJ COMMENTING ON MY POST AND IM COMMENTING ON HIS POST.
CANT WAIT.
THE FANS WILL SUPPORT UNTIL THE END BECAUSE WELL FINISH STRONG AND ALWAYS FOE THAT.
BEST OF LUCK.
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US JU.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.
WITH ANTONIO BROWN NOW DEPARTED TO OAKLAND JUJU WILL BECOME BIG BENS NUMBER ONE MAN AND HE SHOULD RECEIVE TIGHTER COVERAGE.
OVER THE LAST TWO SEASONS WHEN FACING PRESS COVERAGE JUJU ACTUALLY HAD A BETTER PASS RATE AND YARDS PER TARGET THAN ANTONIO BROWN.
CLEARLY VICTOR PERSPECTIVE CHANGES A LITTLE BIT I WILL THINK.
HES THE NUMBER ONE GUY.
HE CAN SAY WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FOR JUJU STARTING THIS SEASON TAN SAY LAST YEAR.
THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT IS THE MINDSET PERSPECTIVE.
COMING INTO THAT LOCKER ROOM AND ANTONIO BROWN IS NOT THERE.
JUST YOU AND NOW YOU BECOME KIND OF THAT LEADER.
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO YOU.
YOUVE BEEN THERE.
YOU UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE.
22 YEARS OLD BUT NOW YOU BECOME THE GUY THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE TEAMMATES ARE LOOKING UP TO YOU WANTING TO KNOW WHAT YOURE DOING AND WANT TOCK HANG OUT WITH YOU IN THE OFFSEASON AND STEAL A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE FROM YOU AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BEN AND GET A HEAD START ON WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO GET BETTER AND HE LEADS THE CHARGE IN THAT REGARD AND ITS PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL.
I THINK THE STEELERS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AND WERE PREPARING FOR THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THERE WAS THAT WHOLE NOTION OF WE HAVE TO BIN FOR TODAY AND DEVELOP FOR TOMORROW.
AND YOU LOOK AT THAT POSITION AND THAT ORGANIZATION GOING BACK TO MIKE WALLACE SANTONIO HOLMES OBVIOUSLY ANTONIO BROWN SMITHSCHUSTER DO A GREAT JOB OF GETTING GUYS IN THE PIPELINE AND DEVELOPED AND NOW ANTONIO BROWN MOVES ON SMITHSCHUSTER STEPS UP AND HAVE DONE A REMARKLY GREAT JOB FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AT THIS POSITION.
I THINK THATS A GAIT POINT AND WOULD ARGUE OUTSIDE OF NEW ENGLAND THEY POSSIBLY DO IT AS WELL AS ANYBODY IN TERMS OF CONTINUITY AND NOW ANTONIO BROWN ENDED IN A WAY THEY PROBABLY DIDNT ANTICIPATE BUT DID ANTICIPATE IT WOULD END AT SOME POINT AND TO YOUR POINT THEY SEEM TO BE SORT OF IN LOCKSTEP WITH PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
I THINK THERES THREE THINGS THAT JUJU JOOUMG HAS TO PROBABLY FOCUS ON THIS SEASON.
ITS GOING FROM BEING A GREAT RECEIVER TO AN ELITE RECEIVER.
HE NEEDS TO PLAY AT THAT LEVEL.
VICTOR TOUCHED ON THE LEADERSHIP ASPECT.
OBVIOUSLY JUST FROM THAT INTERVIEW YOU CAN HEAR HE HAS STEPPED UP TO BE THE LEAD EVER TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO GET BIG BEN AND THE OFFENSIVE LINE TO PARTICIPATE IN HIS CELEBRATION DRILLS AND THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY THERE AND THEN THAT THIRD LAYER IS BEING A MENTOR TO THOSE YOUNGER GUYS SO HES GOING TO BE ASKED A LOT MORE OF HIM AS A FOOTBALL PLAYER OUT ON THE FIELD AND OF COURSE IN THE LOCKER ROOM BUT IF THERES ONE THING I THINK WEVE LEARNED ABOUT JUJU OVER THE YEARS IS HE ATTACKS EVERYTHING WITH OPEN ARMS.
HE IS AN OPEN BOOK HIMSELF.
HE EMBRACES THAT ROLE AND HE WANTS TO BE THAT CHARACTER GUY.
HE WANTS TO BE THAT GOOD GUY AND WHEN HE TAOS TO PLAYERS ON THE STEELERS ABOUT JUJU SMITH AND WHAT HIS PERSONALITY IS LIKE OBVIOUSLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA HES SO MUCH FUN APPARENTLY HE DOES A LOT OF HIS WORK SILENTLY.
HES NOT THE LOUDEST GUY IN THE ROOM.
NOT THE ONE JOKING AROUND DURING DRILLS.
HE LIKES TO HAVE FUN BUT HE IS LOCKED IN AND FOCUSED AND I THINK IF HE CAN TAKE HIT GAME TO THATS LET LEVEL THE ANTONIO BROWN CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE GOING TO BE HAVING WILL FEEL SO LONG AGO.
HE SAID THAT WAS REALLY IMPRESSIVE IN THE INTERVIEW AND TOUCHED ON THE END ABOUT THE STEELERS ARE ALWAYS THERE IN THE EN.
ITS NOT WHERE YOU START.
ITS WHERE YOU END AND YOU LOOK AT PITTSBURGH AND NEW ENGLAND.
THOSE TEAM ALWAYS IMPROVE DURING THE COURSE OF THE SEASON SO JAMES CONNER SMITHSCHUSTER IN A NEW ROLE.
NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER.
ARE THEY ASCENDING AND GETTING BETTER AND MIKE TOMLIN DESERVES SO MUCH CREDIT.
PLAYER DEVELOPMENT.
THE WAY THEY COACH THEIR PLAYERS GET BETTER AND I THOUGHT HIS POINT WAS A GOOD ONE WHICH IS HEY WELL BE THERE IN THE END BECAUSE THATS WHERE THEYVE BEEN YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT.
SEEMS LIKE THEY TRANSFORM AND MORPH INTO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO BE TO WIN TOWARD THE SECOND HALF OF 9 SEASON AND KEEPS THEM IN THE HUNT.
FROM ALL KIND OF REASONS WHY EVERYBODY IS LOOKING TO CLEVELAND BUT I THINK YOUD BE UNWISE TO SLEEP ON PITTSBURGH IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.
MIKE TOMLIN A VETERAN SQUAD A GOOD TEAM.
I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE UNDERACHIEVED LAST SEASON.
WELL SEE.
WHAT DO PATRICK MAHOMES SAQUON BARKLEY AND KYLER MURRAY HAVE IN COMMON?
THEY TURN HEADS.
WELL CROWN THE HIGHLIGHT KING NEXT.
YOU EVER WATCH HIGHLIGHTS FROM YOUTUBE?
PATRICK MAHOMES ON FIRE.
ONE WAY ZINGS IT ANOTHER.
GIANTS OVER THE TOP.
TOUCHDOWNS KYLER MURRAY.
AN ABSOLUTE DIME.
HES THE BEST QUARTERBACK YOULL EVER SEE AT EVERYTHING ELSE EXCEPT HEIGHT.
PATRICK MAHOMES WITH MAHOMES MAGIC.
If only there was a place nearbyyou could get one of these.
Or these.
Good thing theyre sold literally everywhere business is done.
Im pretty sure you could buy them at a bank.
Not Sorry.

LETS TAKE A LOOK AT A FEW NFL PLAYERS NOMINATED FOR THE ESPYS.
AFTER AN IMPRESSIVE SOPHOMORE SEASON THROWING OVER 5000 YARDS AND WON AN MVP JUST THAT PATRICK MAHOMES NOMINATED FOR BEST MALE ATHLETE.
SAQUON BARKLEY NOMINATE THE FOR THE BEST BREAKTHROUGH ATHLETE LAST SEASON BARKLEY RUSHED FOR 1307 YARDS.
BROKE A GIANTS ROOKIE RECORD.
KYLER MURRAY BECAME THE SEVENTH PLAYER TO WIN THE HEISMAN IN OUS HISTORY.
NONE OF THOSE ARE TOO SHABBY.
TODAY WE GIVE OUT THE HIGHLIGHT KING AWARD.
AN ESPY.
IT IS NOT?
IT SHOULD BE.
FUNNY MY CHOICE HERE IS KANSAS CITY QUARTERBACK PATRICK MAHOMES.
HE IS UP FOR MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR.
GETS MY VOTE.
HEARD WHY.
AGAINST THE RAVENS FACING FOURTH AND NINE FROM THE TEAMS 40.
MAHOMES IS HIT.
WE HAVE SEEN HIM DO COUNTLESS TIMES WHICH WAS BUY TIME WITH HIS FEET.
GET OUT OF BOUNDS RELIES ON HIS RIGHT HAND.
FINES TYREEK HILL DOWNFIELD AND AFTER THE PART ANDY REID SAID THATS HOW WE DESIGN I HAD IT.
OH SURE ANDY.
AGAINST THE BRONCOS.
WE KNEW HIS RIGHT HAND WAS MAGICAL.
DID YOU JUST SAY LUCKY.
WE NEW HIS RIGHT HAND WAS MAGICAL.
HIS LEFT HAND HERE SPOTS VON MILLER COMING RIGHT AT HIM.
EVEN WHEN YOUR DEFENSE IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY SHOULD BE DOING THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CANNOT BE PATRICK MAHOMES BECAUSE HE COMES UP WITH SOME UNTHINKABLE MOMENT HERE.
HIS ATHLETICISM.
VISION OF THE FIELD AND HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN THE POCKET MAKE PLAYS AND OUTSIDE THE POCKET IS WHERE HES PERHAPS PROBABLY MOST DANGEROUS.
YOUR HIGHLIGHT.
OH WAIT.
HES YOUR HIGHLIGHT KING.
HE IS MY HIGHLIGHT KING BECAUSE HE IS A HIGHLIGHT MACHINE.
AS YOU CAN SEE HES BROKEN AT LEAST 47 TACKLES ON THAT ONE TO GET TO THE END ZONE.
HES JUST PUTTING HIS FOOT IN THE GROUND.
WILL NOT BE DENIED AGAINST PHILADELPHIA.
OBVIOUSLY A RIVALRY IN THAT DIVISION AND HES TAKING OFF ON THAT ONE.
IN THIS ONE THIS ONE IS THIS PRETTY GOOD.
OKAY.
WE KNOW THIS GUY GETS A TREMENDOUS BLOCK BY 73.
THIS RUN IS JUST INDICATIVE OF THE TYPE OF ATHLETE THAT SAQUON BARKLEY IS.
HE CAN SHAKE GUYS BEHIND HIM.
IN FRONT OF HIM AND HAS THE SPEED TO OUTRUN ANYONE IN THE LEAGUE.
THATS WHAT WE SEE HERE AND ALWAYS ON DISPLAY.
A BONUS DIANNA WHEN I HEAR THIS ONE HURDLE.
NOT ONLY A HANDFUL OF GUYS THAT CAN PROBABLY COUNT THEM ON ONE HAND WHO CAN HURTLE GUYS LIKE THAT AND KEEP IT MOVING.
YOU.
YOU TALK ABOUT THAT PLAY.
EXACTLY.
PILE ON YOUR GIANTS BUT THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT WITH THAT OLINE.
MIKE TANNENBAUM.
I GOT KYLER MURRAY.
I WAS AT THIS GAME.
HIS RESILIENCY WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
THEY GOT OUTPLAYED BADLY IN THE FIRST HALF.
COMES OUT IN THE SECOND HALF.
HE STEPS UP OUT OF THE POCKET.
KEEPS HIS EYES DOWNING THE FEEL.
PUTS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON A DEFENSE.
THROWS A REALLY ACCURATE PASS.
THIS WAS A GREAT PLAY.
GOT OKLAHOMA BACK IN THE GAME.
THIS WAS ANOTHER GAME I WAS AT.
WEST VIRGINIAS DEFENSE WAS HORRIFIC IN THIS GAME.
IF THEY WERE PLAYING FLAG FOOTBALL KYLER MURRAY STILL WOULD HAVE GOT UNTOUCHED AND  FLAG FOOTBALL.
YEAH.
THIS WAS WHAT ARIZONA WAS HOPING FOR.
LOOK AT HOW MANY GUYS HE CAN MAKE MISS IN SPACE AND HAVE THE SPEED TO TAKE IT ALL THE WAY.
THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE HELL PUT ON DEMPS WILL BE FORMIDABLE IN THE FALL BECAUSE IT WILL BE HIS ARM AND SPEED.
LOOK AT THIS ONE.
OKLAHOMA STATE BIG RIVALRY GAME.
AGAIN 50 YARDS DOWN THE FIELD.
HOLLYWOOD BROWN IN STRIDE.
THIS GUY WILL BE A DYNAMIC PLAYMAKER.
HE IS A HIGHLIGHT MUNGONGO THE HIGHLIGHT TEAMMAKER AND ARIZONA CARDINAL FANS IS WHAT THEYRE LOOKING FORWARD TO IN THE FALL.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH ROB MENDEZ WHO WILL BE THE RECIPIENT OF THE JIMMY V AWARD FOR PERSEVERANCE.
BORN WITH AN EXTREMELY RARE CONDITION THAT AFFECTS BLESS THAN 100 PEOPLE IN THE WORLD MENDEZ FOUND HIS CALLING COACHING A SPORT HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO PLAY HIMSELF.
FEATURED CHRONICLED AND HIS FIRST SEASON AS A HEAD FOOTBALL COACH CAPTURING THE INSPIRING AND UNLIKELY STORY OF A COACH WHO TRANSFORMED A GROUP OF YOUNG ATHLETES FROM SKEPTICS INTO BELIEVERS.
AT THIS TIME I JUST WANT TO INTRODUCE TO YOU SOMEBODY I THINK CAN REALLY HELP TURN THIS PROGRAM AROUND.
A COACH THAT I HIRED BECAUSE I WAS IMPRESSED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME.
HIS PASSION BLEW ME AWAY.
EVERYTHING ELSE THATS ON TOP OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE DOES ON A DAYTODAY BASIS INSPIRES ME.
YOUR NEW COACH ROB MENDEZ.
 APPLAUSE  IT WAS AWFUL.
REALLY REALLY AWFUL.
I HAD TO KEEP ROBERT.
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ASKING WHY WHY MY SON?
YOU KNOW LESS THAN 100 BORN LIKE HIM IN THE WORLD.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DID WITH THIS BOY?
IT WAS HARD TO SEE HIM.
I REALLY DIDNT WANT TO SEE ROBERT.
I DIDNT SEE ROBERT FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS BECAUSE I JUST I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I JUST REMEMBER STARING YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF STARING.
LIKE HE WAS NOT A HUMAN OR SOMETHING.
BUT HES DIFFERENT.
YEAH.
HE SEES PEOPLES STARING AS AN OPPORTUNITY.
EVERYONE OUT THERE YOU KNOW ME ROBERT MENDEZ.
THINGS THAT YOU AND I GET TO DO IN TEN MINUTES MIGHT TAKE HIM AN HOUR BUT HE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT IT.
ROBERT WAS JUST A REALLY EASY CHILD.
AND HE JUST WAS REALLY REALLY HAPPY.
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE TEAM?
SAN FRANCISCO 49ers.
HAS A GIFT THAT DOESNT REQUIRE HIM TO BE PHYSICAL.
MAKING HIM AWARE OF THAT I THINK HE JUST TOOK THE BALL AND RAN.
I THINK THE MOST DIFFICULT PART ABOUT HAVING NO ARMS AND NO LEGS IS SIMPLY NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY SPORTS.
I DONT SHOW IT.
IM GOOD AT NOT SHOWING IT BUT YEAH I GET MAD.
MAD AT GOD.
THE LORD.
LIKE WHY.
HIS FRESHMAN YEAR AND HE WAS STANDING BEHIND THE FENCE AT A DISTANCE WATCHING THEM PRACTICE.
THAT WAS THE BEGINNING.
WE WANTED TO GET HIM INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM SO INVITED HIM TO BE OUR MANAGER.
THEY DIDNT KNOW WHAT I COULD DO.
THEY OBVIOUSLY KNEW I COULDNT PLAY BUT TO INCLUDE ME MADE ME FEEL A PART OF IT.
MADE ME FEEL I GUESS YOU CAN SAY NORMAL.
HE PAID ATTENTION TO US AS COACHES BUT HE LEARNED THE GAME BY MADDEN FOOTBALL.
HE CREATED GAME PLANS ON MADDEN AND THEN HED COME TO PRACTICE AND TRY TO CREATE THE SAME GAME PLANS AND EXECUTE THEM THE SAME WAY.
I STARTED TO GIVING ROBERT A LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBILITY WITH MY QUARTERBACKS.
EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK.
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW HE WAS THERE RUNNING THE DRILLS FOR US.
GO GO GO GO.
WHEN YOU ROLL OUT BIG EYES.
BIG EYES OKAY.
HIS ABILITY TO STUDY THE GAME AND HIS ABILITY TO TRANSLATE THOSE THINGS TO THE KIDS IS UNMATCHED BY MOST OF THE COACHES THAT I KNOW.
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LINE.
RAM OVER.
W 6 ORBIT.
GOOD JOB.
AWESOME.
IVE BEEN OVERLOOKED THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS IVE BEEN READY FOR IT.
WHEN I GO TO A JOB INTERVIEW I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES SCARING IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD.
SURPRISES AND I DONT THOUGH HOW THEYLL TAKE THE SURPRISE.
AS HE ROLLS OUT TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST WHEN I SAW THAT HOW CAN THIS GUY COACH.
AND AS HE COMES CLOSE GIVE ME A FIST PUMP.
GIVE ME A FIST PUMP.
I JUST GIVE HIM A FIST PUMP ON THE SHOULDER AND ALL THAT NERVES THAT I HAD WAS JUST MELTED AWAY.
WE HAD OTHER POLITICS SO I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT HE WOULD BE A GREAT FIT FOR THESE YOUNG ATHLETES.
I REMEMBER WHEN COACH HIRED ME AND RECRUITED ME OFF CAMPUSS OF LIKE YES I FELT REALLY ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE IT TOOK ME SO LONG.
I KNEW IVE BEEN READY FOR IT AND IVE BEEN OVERLOOKED AND FINALLY SOMEONE GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY SO I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT.
AT THIS TIME I JUST WANT TO INTRODUCE TO YOU YOUR NEW JV HEAD COACH ROB MENDEZ.
 APPLAUSE  APPRECIATE THAT COACH CABLE.
THANK YOU COACH.
YOU KNOW FOOTBALL IS MY PASSION.
I CANT WAIT TO GET TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF YOUR TEAMMATES AND WHAT YOURE DOING.
ARE WE CLEAR GENTLEMEN?
YES SIR.
IM EXCITED GUYS.
 APPLAUSE  OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A LITTLE SHOCKING AND THERE WAS JOKES GOING AROUND.
TYPICAL TEENAGERS YOU KNOW A GUY WITH NO ARMS OR LEG NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THAT.
IF YOURE TAKEN BACK THATS JUST NATURAL AND THATS HUMAN.
BUT AFTER THE FIRST TWO SECONDS ITS JUST A NORMAL GUY.
I DONT CARE HOW GOOD YOU ARE I DONT CARE HOW EXPERIENCED YOU ARE YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING AS A TEAM.
THOUGH HE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE A COACH HE DEFINITELY ACTS LIKE ONE.
SO WHAT WELL TEACH RIGHT NOW IS CALLED 31 ZONE.
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME TORE SOMEBODY THAT HASNT ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH IT IS IMPRESSIVE.
ON HIS PHONE HE CAN DIAGRAM A PLAY FASTER THAN I CAN DO WITH A PEN AND PAPER.
THERES DEFINITELY DOUBTERS OUT THERE LIKE PARENTS LIKE MY SON IS GETTING COACHED BY A QUARTERBACK WITH A GUY WITH NO ARMS AND NO LEGS.
THAT LIGHTS A FIRE UNDER MY BUTT AND PROBABLY GETS ME EXCITED BECAUSE I REALLY JUST TRY TO PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ABOUT IT.
WHEN THEY SEE HIM AND WITNESS HEAR HIM ID LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY TAKE A MOMENT TO EVALUATE THEMSELVES AND ANYTHING THAT THEYVE GONE THROUGH IN LIFE CANT BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN WHAT HE ENDURES ON A DAILY BASIS.
ONE THING I CARE ABOUT MORE THAN ANYTHING IS BEING A FAMILY.
THAT IS ONE THING I TAKE PRIDE ON.
I LOVE PEOPLE.
YOU I LOVE I LOVE YOU.
EVERYONE.
SO IF YOU GUYS CANT GET ALONG YOU BETTER GET OFF ME.
WHOM AM I GOING TO GO TO?
SO SO SO.
IT WAS A FRACTURED ORBIT TALL BONE AND MY CHEEKBONE WAS FRACTURED AS WELL.
I COULDNT SLEEP.
CHEW.
I JUST FELT BAD FOR HIM.
HES GOT A HARD LIFE.
I TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS I CAN.
THINGS THAT YOU AND I TAKE FOR GRANTED LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH OR WASHING YOUR FACE OR TAKING A SHOWER OR GOING TO THE RESTROOM ROBERT NEEDS SOMEONE TO HELP HIM.
BUT HES TOUGH.
TWO DAYS LATER EVANS AT HIS PRACTICE.
WIDEN OUT.
WIDEN OUT BOTH OF YOU.
HIS THING IS NO I GOT TO BE THERE FOR THE KIDS.
GO TO THE FLACK.
HES BEEN WAITING TO BE A HEAD COACH FOR A LONG TIME.
I DIDNT WANT TO LET THEM DOWN.
I DIDNT WANT TO LET THE KIDS DOWN.
I JUST CANT STAY AWAY I GUESS.
ME BEING CHALLENGED HAS BEEN MY MOTIVATION.
ALL I GOT TO SAY IS WHO SAYS I CANT.
 CHANTING NOBODY  WHO SAYS I CANT ORIGINALLY CAME FROM KNEE JUST HAVING A DRIVE TO ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER PEOPLE DOUBTED ME FOR.
WHO SAYS I CANT.
NOBODY.

I CANT REMEMBER ONE GAME WE WERE BIGGER THAN THE OTHER TEAM BUT WE GOT THE JOB DONE.
THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT.
THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT.
WE GOT THE MOMENTUM.
KEEP IT UP.
LETS GO.
THEYVE HAD MOSTLY LOSING SEASONS.
HE JUST REALLY HAS DONE A JOB THAT I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO SEE OTHER COACHES DO AT THAT LEVEL BEFORE.
IM TRAINED TO SEND THEM OVER THE MIDDLE BECAUSE ITS GOING TO BE RIGHT HERE OVER THE MIDDLE.
LETS GO.
YEAH.
ITS GOOD.
APPRECIATE IT GUYS.
LETS GO.
WHO SAYS I CANT.
WHAT?
WHO SAYS I CANT?

I REALLY SINCERELY WANT YOU GUYS TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THIS.
YOU GUYS HAVE GIVEN ME A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES.
OUR OPPONENTS THEYD ALWAYS DOUBT HIM BECAUSE THEY SEE A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR.
TO US WE SEE OUR COACH WHO IS PERFECT.
AFTER THE GAME MAKES ME FEEL LIKE PROUD TO HAVE HIM AS MY COACH.
THESE KIDS WOULD FOLLOW HIM NO MATTER WHERE HE GOES.
WE CAN SEE THE CHANGES IN THE KIDS.
CAN I GET A HUG?
YOU WANT THE BEST FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND I TOLD HIM ONE TIME NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN THIS ROBERT.
AND HE TOLD ME NOT EVERYBODY DOES WHAT THEY DO FOR MONEY.
HES RIGHT.
THEY GAVE ME THE FEELING OF IMPORTANCE.
AND I DONT THINK THEY KNOW THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT.
MAYBE THEY WILL ONE DAY BUT I LOVE THOSE KIDS AND IM ALWAYS GOING TO REMEMBER THEM.
YEAH.
I THINK WE MAKE A PERFECT TEAM.
CAN WE AGREE ON THAT.
YES SIR.

JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER WILL ENTER TRAINING CAMP WITH THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS NUMBER ONE WIDE RECEIVER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER.
HERES MR. SMITHSCHUSTER ON WHAT ITS LIKE AND THE EXPECTATION OF STEPING INTO THAT ROLE.
ALL THESE PEOPLE SAY YOURE THE NUMBER ONE GUY THIS YEAR BUT MORE FOR MYSELF I SEE MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND OTHER GUYS TO STEP UP.
A.B.
HAVING 100 CATCHES OVER A THOUSAND YARDS.
THOSE YARDS THOSE CATCHES WILL BE SPREAD OUT BETWEEN OUR OFFENSE AND JAMES CONNER AND JAMES WASHINGTON DONTE UPON CHIEF.
A LOT OF GAMES JAMES SAMUELS.
THERES SO MANY GUYS THAT WILL GET MORE TOUCH MORE YARD MORE YAC TO HELP THEM INDIVIDUALLY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY IM THE SAME JUJU.
LAST YEAR I WAS 21 THIS YEAR IM 22 SAME THING.
THE OLDER WISER MORE MATURE JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER WITH A GOOD JAC REFERENCE.
ALWAYS.
GOT US THINKING OBVIOUSLY BIG SHOES TO FILL WITH ANTONIO BROWN DEPARTED.
HES NOW AN OAKLAND RAIDER SO LETS GO ONE BY ONE RECEPTIONS MORE OR LESS RAN TONE YORE OWE JUJU.
JUJU MADE ALL MY POINTS AND WILL SPREAD THE BALL AROUND AND HAVE A HEAD COACH IN JON GRUDEN THE PLAY CALLER GAVE UP A LOT OF MONEY A.L.
WILL HAVE MORE RECEPTIONS.
I THINK JON GRUDEN IS MOTIVATED TO GET BROWN THE FOOTBALL.
TOUCHDOWNS.
A.B.
AS WELL.
AND YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY TEED ME UP PERFECTLY BECAUSE I THINK IF THERE IS ANYONE THAT WANTS TO MAKE ANTONIO BROWN WORK IN OAKLAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE MONEY IT WOULD BE JON GRUDEN SO HES CALLING ALL THE SHOTS AND IN TERMS OF WIDE RECEIVERS WE CAN DEBATE ALL DAY LONG WHO IS THE BEST BUT KNOW HOW SPECIAL A.B.
CAN BE AND AS SOON AS HE FIGURES OUT THAT CHEMISTRY WITH DEREK CARR HE WILL HAVE MORE.
RECEPTION TOUCHDOWNS AND HOW ABOUT ALL PURPOSE YARDS VICTOR CRUZ.
ILL GIVE JUJU SOME LOVE HERE.
FINALLY.
MIKE AND DIANNA HAVE NOT GIVEN HIM ANY LOVE BUT IM GIVING HIM YARDS.
IN THOSE PRESSURE SITUATIONS BEN WILL LOOK FOR HIM TO BE THE NUMBER ONE RECEIVER AND GET HIM THE BALL IN SPACE AN DEEP ROUTES AND CAN RUN ANY ROUTE IN THE BOOK.
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY USE HIM AS THE NUMBER ONE GUY.
A TEAM GAME AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT THEY ARE.
WHAT REALLY MATTERS OF COURSE YOU HOPE IS THE NUMBER OF WINS FROM EACH TEAM.
WE GOT THE STEELERS AND RAIDERS.
WHO GETS THE EDGE.
PITTSBURGH IMPROVEMENT WITH OAKLAND ON OFFENSE JOSH JACOB TERRELL WILLIAMS A.B.
OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER YEAR WITH DEREK CARR AND JON GRUDEN REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE DEFENSE AND THEY LOST KHALIL MACK.
WHILE THEY DRAFTED THOSE PLAYERS FROM CLEMSON IN THE FIRST ROUND IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO GET GOING AND BE A WORK IN PROGRESS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ARE ON DEFENSE.
ILL GO WITH MIKE TOMLIN AND VERY MATURE PITTSBURGH STEELER ORGANIZATION.
I THINK THATS A PRETTY GOOD BET.
HOW ABOUT CELEBRATIONS?
IS THIS TEAM A QUESTION?
NOT A QUESTION AT ALL.
IM GOING WITH JUJU MAIN LAY BECAUSE IT DOESNT EVEN HAVE TO BE HIM TO SCORE TO DO THE CELEBRATION.
HES MADE THAT CLEAR.
EVERYBODY IS IN ON THIS THING WHETHER ITS HIM OR McDONALD OR ANY OTHER PERSON ON THAT TEAM THEYLL BE CELEBRATING AND JUJU WILL BE LEADING THE WAY.
LET ME TELL YOU IF YOU DID NOT SEE IT JUJU WAS WITH US ABOUT AN HOUR AGO AND SAID HE IS WORKING ON BEN ROETHLISBERGER TO GET HIM INVOLVED.
HES NOT COMMITTED BUT TRYING.
VALIANT EFFORT.
WELL SEE ABOUT THAT.
THE RESIDENT CELEBRATION EXPERT FOR US.
LIKE ANYTHING CELEBRATION WE HAVE TO GO TO HIM.
HERE I AM TAKING A BOW FOR YOU.
WE HAVE ONE MORE CATEGORY.
HOW ABOUT THE DRAMA.
UHOH.
THE DRAMA.
IS IT ON THERE OR NO.
WELL SEE HERE.
I GUESS NOT.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL JUST DO THE DRAMA.
IM GOING TO GO WITH WHAT HISTORY SAYS AND I THINK ITS GOING TO BE ANTONIO BROWN ON THIS AND ILL STICK WITH THAT.
I LIKE THE WAY JUJU SMITHSCHUSTER IS MATURING INTO NOT JUST A MENTOR TO THESE YOUNGER PLAYERS BUT AN ACTUAL LEADER ON THE STEELERS TEAM AND FOR ANTONIO BROWN THERE ARE A LOT OF PERSONALITIES ON THE ROSTER.
JON GRUDEN IS THE FOCAL POINT OF THIS TEAM NO MATTER WHO IS ON IT BUT I THINK THERES GOING TO BE POINTS DURING THE SEASON WHERE THE A.B.
OF PITTSBURGH WILL SHOW ITS FACE IN OAKLAND.
YOU CANNOT WE WILL NOT GET TO THIS SEASON WITHOUT HIM GETTING IRKED WITH DEREK CARR.
NO WAY.
IT TAKES ONE BALL ENALE HE BE LIKE REALLY.
PUT SOME MONEY ON IT.

DREW BREES FINDS HIHIMSELF ONLYLY 35 YARDS AWAY.
ITS ABOUT OUR STRENGTH.
JUST PEYTON MANNING LEFT TO PASS.
HE STARTS IN THE SHOTGUN.
DROPS BACK.
LOOKS TO THE FAR SIDELINE.
WIDE OPEN AND WHAT A WAY TO DO IT.
UHOH.
DREW BREES IS THE NFLS ALLTIME LEADING PASSER.
HEY BOYS.
HOW ABOUT THAT HUH.
ONLY ONE WORD THAT COMES TO MIND.
GREATNESS.
WELL WE CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE STAVETSKIS AND THE NFL THAT EARNED ESPY NOMINATIONS THIS YEAR.
THE AMAZING MOMENT FROM DREW BREES IS UP FOR THE ESPY FOR BEST RECORDBREAKING PERFORMANCE.
BREES BROKE THE PASSING RECORD WHEN HE PASSED PEYTON MANNINGS MARK AND VICTOR YOU MADE THIS POINT YESTERDAY ITS TRUE.
I THINK LAST YEAR WAS HIS BEST BET AT WINNING MVP.
YOU JUST HAD THIS PESKY PATRICK MAHOMES WHO DID THINGS THAT JUST DIDNT SEEM POSSIBLE TO KEEP BREES FROM WINNING THAT AWARD.
EXACTLY.
HOW DO YOU AMASS SUCH A MONUMENTAL RECORD LIKE THIS ON AN ILLUSTRIOUS AND NOT WIN THE LEAGUE MVP ONE TIME.
PEYTON MANNING TOM BRADY HES GOT TO GET IT ONE TIME.
HES PUTTING UP NUMBERS EACH AND EVERY YEAR AND THERE ARE YEARS HE GOES UNDER THE RADAR WITH THOSE PLAYMAKERS AND EVERYBODY HE HAS.
THIS IS A YEAR LETS PUT A NICE PRETTY RED BOW ON THIS CAREER AND PUT A LEAGUE MVP UNDER MY BELL AND GET BACK TO THE BIG DANCE HOPEFULLY AND KEEP THINGS GOING.
SO IN FAIRNESS HE HAS BEEN A SUPER BOWL MVP TWOTIME OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR.
BUT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING QUALITY QUARTERBACK OF DREW BREES HE WOULD TAKE A LOMBARDI TROPHY ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.
AT LEAST GIVE HIM ONE LEAGUE MVP.
HES EARNED IT.
HOW ABOUT THE BEST OF THE DREW BREES.
THIS IS VINTAGE RIGHT HERE.
