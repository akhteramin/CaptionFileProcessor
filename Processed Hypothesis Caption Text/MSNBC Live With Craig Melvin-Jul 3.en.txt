 LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE THE LAST ONE.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OURSELVES BETTER AND PUT OURSELVES IN THE BEST POSITION?
THERE YOU GO.
ENTIRE COUNTRY IS ROOTING FOR THOSE WOMEN.
THE WHITE HOUSE JUST ANNOUNCED THEYRE SENDING A DELEGATION OVER TO THE GAME IN FRANCE LED BY THE DEPARTMENT COMMERCE OF SECRETARY AND OTHERS.
ITS GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW AND THANK YOU ALL FOR WATCHING THIS HOUR OF MSNBC LIVE.
CRAIG WHERE ARE YOU WATCHING THE GAME?
GO TEAM USA.
ILL BE WATCHING FROM THE COMFY CONFINES OF MY BASEMENT.
VERY NICE.
BIG SCREEN.
LOVE IT.
CRAIG MEDICAL SIN HERE MSNBC HEADQUARTERS NEW YORK CITY.
TANKS IN POSITION PREPARATIONS UNDER WAY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMPS BIG FOURTH OF JULY EVENT INCLUDING THOSE MILITARY VEHICLES NOW ON THE NATIONAL MALL AS NEW DETAILS ABOUT HOW ITS BEING PAID FOR ARE GENERATING MORE FURRY.
ALSO HAWKEYE SWING.
2020 CANDIDATES MAKING THEIR WAY TO IOWA FOR THE HOLIDAY AS A NEW POLL OF VOTERS IN THAT STATE REVEALS SOME NEW CHALLENGES FOR SOME OF THOSE CONTENDERS.
TWO OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS WILL JOIN ME LIVE THIS HOUR.
TWO OF THEM.
ALSO TICKING TIME BOMB.
THAT IS HOW ONE OFFICIAL IN A NEW GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG REPORT DESCRIBES THE HORRIFIC CONDITIONS INSIDE MIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES.
IT INCLUDES SHOCKING NEW IMAGES FROM INSIDE.
WELL GET TO THAT STORY IN JUST A MOMENT.
BUT WE START WITH THOSE TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES DESCENDING ON THE NATIONAL MALL FOR PRESIDENT TRUMPS SELFPRODUCED FOURTH OF JULY EVENT TOMORROW.
IN A BREAK FROM TRADITION THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDER A DISPLAY OF AMERICAN MILITARY MIGHT IN THE CAPITAL THAT.
PLAN ITS MEANING AND ITS COST ALL STIRRING CONTROVERSY.
JOINING ME NOW NEW HAMPSHIRES MONICA ALBA LIVE ON THE NATIONAL MALL.
ASHLEY PARKER WHITE HOUSE REPORTER FOR THE WASHINGTON POST.
AN MSNBC SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST.
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN DON BAIRD IS WITH ME HIS DISTRICT INCLUDES NORTH VIRGINIA.
AND WASHINGTON POST OPINION RATE WRITER JENNIFER REUBEN AND MARK PRESIDENTIAL HORN AND PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE LBJ FOUNDATION.
QUITE ESTEEMED PANEL HERE.
MONICA ILL START WITH YOU.
WHAT ARE WE SEEING THERE ON THE MALL TODAY?
SO CRAIG ACTUALLY IF I TURN HERE YOURE GOING TO SEE TWO BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLES.
AND THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE MILITARY MIGHT THATS GOING TO BE ON DISPLAY TOMORROW EVENING.
THIS IS OF COURSE BEING TRANSPORTED ON SUCH A LARGE FLATBED BECAUSE OF HOW HEAVY THEY ARE.
THE ABRAMS TANKS WHICH ARE OTHER TANKS PARKED NEARBY AND GOING TO BE ON THE MALL WEIGH AS MUCH AS 60 TONS.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THATS SOMETHING THAT COULD DAMAGE D.C.
STREETS AND SOME OF THE PRESIDENTS CRITICS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THAT.
BUT THATS WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS ON DISPLAY.
HE WANTS TO DO THE SALUTE TO AMERICA AND FEATURE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT MILITARY VEHICLES AFTER BEING INSPIRED TWO YEARS AGO AT THE BASTILLE DAY CELEBRATIONS IN PARIS WHERE HE SAW THE PARADE WITH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON AND SAID I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO DO THIS.
HE THEN THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE ON VETERANS DAY BUT THAT GOT CANCELED YOU MAY REMEMBER AND MOVED TO THE FOURTH OF JULY BECAUSE OF HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.
THE WASHINGTON POST IS REPORTING THAT ITS GOING TO BE AT LEAST 2.5 MILLION IN ENTRANCE FEES REDIRECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EVENT TOMORROW.
AND OF COURSE WE DONT KNOW WHAT THE COST IS YET OF THE OTHER MILITARY FLYOVERS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED THAT A LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO BE FREE BECAUSE WE OWNERSHIP THE EQUIPMENT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE SECURITY AND OTHER CONCERNS OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO KIND OF PUT THAT PRICE TAG UP HIGH.
AND WE DONT KNOW HOW MUCH THATS GOING TO COST.
NOW THESE TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES ARE GOING TO BE MOVED.
WE DONT KNOW EXACTLY WHEN WERE JUST STEPS FROM THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
BUT THEYRE ALL GOING TO BE PLACED UP AND DOWN THE MALL BUT WE DONT KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY THERE WILL BE.
AND TOMORROW A LOT OF THE EXCITEMENT IS AROUND OF COURSE THE MILITARY FLYOVERS AND WHATS EXPECT TO BE A FLYOVER OF THE AIR FORCE ONE.
BUT THATS THE SCENE FROM HERE THE DAY BEFORE.
MONICA THANK YOU.
ASHLEY YOUR PAPER REPORTING THAT THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE IS DIVERTING 2.5 MILLION IN PARK FEES TO PAY FOR THIS.
THE STORY ADDS QUOTE THE DIVERTED PARK FEES REPRESENT JUST A FRACTION OF THE EXTRA COSTS THE GOVERNMENT FACES AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT WHICH WILL INCLUDE DISPLAYS OF MILITARY HARDWARE FLYOVERS BY JETS INCLUDING AIR FORCE ONE THE DEPLOYMENT OF TANKS ON THE MALL AND AN EXTENDED PYROTECHNIC SHOW.
IS THERE A CONCERN AT THE WHITE HOUSE OF JUST THE SHEER OPTICS OF SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON THIS EXTRAVAGANZA AT THAT POINT?
WELL THERES CERTAINLY NOT A CONCERN FROM THE PRESIDENT.
THIS IS WHAT HE WANTS.
BUT YOU CAN SEE IN THAT TWEET HE SENT THAT HE IS CERTAINLY AWARE OF THE CRITICISM.
THATS SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN VERY COGNIZANT OF WHEN THE POST FIRST REPORTED I BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE SORT OF A LONGER FIREWORKS DISPLAY THAN USUAL BECAUSE SOME COMPANIES HAD VOLUNTEERED TO HELP WITH THAT.
ONE THING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE REALLY TRIED TO MAKE CLEAR WAS THAT YOU KNOW THESE WERE SORT OF NOT QUITE FREE FIREWORKS SHOW BUT AT A REDUCED RATE AND THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SORT OF BE FOOLISH NOT TO TAKE THESE COMPANIES UP ON THE OFFER.
SO THEYRE AWARE OF THIS CRITICISM.
AND KEEP IN MIND YOU MENTIONED THIS EARLIER BUT THE WHOLE REASON THAT HIS PLANS FOR A VETERANS DAY PARADE WERE SCUTTLED WAS BECAUSE THE PRICE TAG GOT TO ABOUT 90 MILLION.
IT WAS JUST WAY TOO HIGH THERE WAS A TON OF OUTCRY INCLUDING THE D.C. GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOT FEASIBLE.
THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT CARE NECESSARILY HES CLEARLY PROCEEDING FULL STEAM AHEAD.
BUT THAT TWEET SHOWS IN OTHER CONVERSATIONS WEVE HAD WITH THE WHITE HOUSE SHOWS THAT THEY ARE AT LEAST AWARE THAT THERE IS A NUMBER THERES A LOT OF CRITICISM COMING FROM ALL SIDES.
ASHLEY WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS REPORTING ON THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE THEY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF VIP TICKETS THAT THEYRE HANDING OUT AS WELL.
ARE THEY HANDING OUT TICKETS TO A TAXPAYER FUNDED EVENT?
WELL THERES CONCERN  THERES BEEN A LOT OF FAIR CRITICISM ABOUT THAT FOR SORT OF POLITICIZING YOU KNOW ONE OF THESE RARE THINGS IN THE NATION THAT IS APOLITICAL A HOLIDAY SYMBOLIC AND ABOUT FIREWORKS AND SPENDING TIME WITH FAMILIES AND BARBECUES.
THEYVE TRIED TO ARGUE THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN SOMETIMES TICKETS ARE HANDED OUT FOR SAY THE EASTER EGG ROLL OR SOMETHING ELSE ON THE SOUTH LAWN.
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT WERE HEARING IS THERES ALSO A LOT OF KIND OF QUIET CHATTER IN THE PRESIDENTS ORBIT THAT THEYRE DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT ANOTHER INAUGURATION FIASCO.
NO ONES GOING TO SHOW UP.
THAT THE PRESIDENTS CROWDS WERE NOT AS BIG AS HIS PREDECESSORS EXACTLY NO ONE WILL SHOW UP.
WHAT HAPPENS IF IT RAINS?
PEOPLE IN A DEEPLY BLUE DISTRICT WHO ARE NOT FANS OF THE PRESIDENT ARE FLEEING TOWN.
PART OF THAT IT SEEMS IS DESIGNED TO KIND OF ENSURE THAT AT LEAST FOR THE CAMERA SHOT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS PACKED AND THERES NOT THESE SORT OF SPLOTCHES OF GREEN GRASS WHERE THE PRESIDENT WANTS A HUGE CROWD BEHIND HIM CELEBRATING HIM.
MARK GIVE US SOME PERSPECTIVE HERE.
HOW UNUSUAL IS IT TO HAVE A MILITARY DISPLAY AND FOR A PRESIDENT TO SPEAK FROM THE MALL IN THE WAY THAT HE IS REPORTEDLY GOING TO ON INDEPENDENCE DAY?
UNPRECEDENTED OR NOT?
WELL LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING THIS PRESIDENT DOES THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED.
THIS IS THE KIND OF MILITARY DISPLAY WE WERE USED TO SEEING FROM THE SOVIET UNION ON MAY DAY.
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DO AS A NATION.
WE HAVE FIREWORKS AND PARADES BUT WE DONT SHOW OUR MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE NATION AND TO THE WORLD.
I THINK THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO VERY MUCH WANTS TO BE SEEN AS A STRONG MAN NOT ONLY TO HIS OWN CITIZENS BUT TO CITIZENS OF THE WORLD.
SO ITS NOT SURPRISING THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD WANT TO DO A DISPLAY LIKE THIS.
CONGRESSMAN BEYER YOU REPRESENT VIRGINIAS EIGHTH DISTRICT HOME THE PENTAGON YOURE JUST ACROSS THE RIVER FROM WASHINGTON D.C. WHATS YOUR OBJECTION TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS PLANNED FOR THE FOURTH?
MELVIN I HAVE THREE BIG.
FIRST THAT HES TAKING SOMETHING THATS ALWAYS BEEN BIPARTISAN I GREW UP IN THE CITY AND MY DAD WOULD LOAD THE SIX KIDS OF US TAKE US DOWN TO THE MALL WITH THE BLANKET AND THE PICNIC BASKET AND NOW ITS TURNED INTO THIS MAJOR PARTISAN THING.
IM STILL ENCOURAGING OUR FOLKS DO BECAUSE I DONT WANT IT TO BE DIVISIVE.
I OBJECT TO THE MILITARIZATION.
WHEN I THINK OF TROOPS WALKING DOWN THE MIDDLE IM THINKING RED SQUARE NORTH KOREA EGYPT NOT THE UNITED STATES WHERE WERE GOING TO SPEND 3QUARTERS OF A TRILLION DOLLARS ON OUR MILITARY.
EVERYONE KNOWS WERE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
YOU ALSO AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU ARE CALLING FOR THE PRESIDENT TO PERSONALLY REIMBURSE TAXPAYERS FOR ANY INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE CAUSED BY MILITARY HARDWARE BROUGHT IN FOR THE CELEBRATION.
I THINK YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE PRESIDENTS NOT GOING TO DO THAT BUT WHAT IS YOUR GOAL WITH THAT DEMAND?
WELL HES FAMOUS FOR NOT PAYING HIS BILLS.
I THINK HE STILL OWES THE DISTRICT 53 MILLION UNREIMBURSE FROM THE INAUGURATION.
ITS JUST TO MAKE THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU TAKE THESE VERY WEIGHTY 60TON ABRAMS TANKS AND PUT THEM NEXT TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL WHO KNOWS WHAT ITS DOING TO D.C.
ROADS.
THERES SOME CONCERN FROM THE PARK SERVICE THAT THE BASEMENTS UNDER THE MEMORIAL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS UP.
ITS JUST AT A TIME WHEN THE PARK SERVICE HAS AN 11 OR 12 BILLION INFRASTRUCTURE BACKLOG TO BE REDIRECTING FUNDS FOR HIS VANITY SHOW JUST DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.
CONGRESSMAN BEYER I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME SIR.
THANK YOU.
TO BE CLEAR YOURE GOING TO GO?
BE THERE?
IM GOING TO GO ON THE EASTERN SHORE WITH MY FAMILY SO NO I WILL NOT BE THERE.
YOULL BE WATCHING ON TELEVISION.
NOT OUT OF PROTEST.
PREVIOUSLY PLANNED.
BUT YOURE ENCOURAGING YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO GO.
YEAH.
ONLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW HES THE MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENT WEVE HAD.
BUT ONE OF OUR GREAT CHALLENGES IS WE LIVE IN A DIVIDED COUNTRY AND WE NEED TO DO OUR BEST TO HEAL.
AND THEY DONT HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIS SPEECH BUT THEY SHOULD ENJOY THE FIREWORKS.
WHY ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO IF YOURE NOT GOING TO GO?
WELL YOU KNOW IF I WERE IN TOWN I PROBABLY WOULD BUT MY WIFE AND KIDS ARE ALREADY ON THE EASTERN SHORE.
GOT IT.
CONGRESSMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
JENNIFER I WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS SURVEY.
THERES A SURVEY OF AMERICAN PRIDE.
ITS FROM GALLOP.
AND ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY 45 OF FOLKS WHO ARE POLLED ARE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN.
THATS THE SECOND STRAIGHT YEAR OF THE SUB50 RATINGS THAT.
PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN WEAKENING IN RECENT YEARS.
TO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE DROP.
FIRST OF ALL I WANT BE GOING TO THE MALL AND IT WONT BE IN PROTEST.
GOOD FOR THE CONGRESSMAN HES A BETTER PERSON THAN I. I THINK PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY DISTURBED WITH WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN DOING TO OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.
TO THE RULE OF LAW TO THE CELEBRATION OF POWERS HIS DISRESPECT FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT CALLING THE PRESS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.
FOR BETTER OR WORSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EMBODIES THE COUNTRY TO SOME DEGREE.
HE IS BOTH THE HEAD OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT.
AND WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE WORLD STAGE THEY ARE NOT PROUD OF HIM.
THEY FIND HIM TACKY THEY FIND HIM CRUDE RACIST HOMOPHOBIC MISOGYNISTIC YOU CAN GO DOWN THE LIST.
AND I THINK THAT DEEPLY WORRIES PEOPLE.
I THINK YOU SEE THIS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL RACE WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE ESSENTIALLY RUNNING ON A PLATFORM TO RESTORE AMERICAN VALUES OF DECENCY INCLUSIVENESS GENEROSITY COMMUNITY.
BECAUSE WE HAVENT GOTTEN THAT FROM THIS PRESIDENT.
HES NOTORIOUSLY AWFUL ON THESE MOMENTS WHEN YOU LOOK TO THE PRESIDENT TO HEAL TO BRING US TOGETHER HES THE ANTIUNITER.
AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE DISPLAY.
ITS ALSO REALLY A CONTEMPT FOR GOVERNMENT.
THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL HATCH ACT VIOLATIONS.
THIS IS USING THE TAXPAYERS MONEY THE TAXPAYERS PROPERTY REALLY FOR HIS OWN VANITY.
AND WHETHER ITS A LEGAL VIOLATION OR NOT IT IS SO UNSEEMLY.
AND I WOULD JUST ADD ONE FINAL THING.
SEEING TANKS ON THE MALL HAS THE APPEARANCE THAT WASHINGTON IS AN OCCUPIED CITY.
WE PUT TANKS ON THE STREET WHEN THERES A CIVIL UPRISING WHEN CALAMITY OF SOME TYPE.
THERE IS NOT.
AND DONALD TRUMP DOESNT GET THAT THIS IS NOT A SYMBOL OF PRIDE OR OF AMERICA BUT THIS THAT IS A DEEPLY DISTURBING SIGN THAT HE IS POLITICIZING THE MILITARY AND MILL TAR MILITARYI COUNTRY.
ARE WE AT A POINT WHERE WE CANT SEPARATE OUR PATRIOTISM FROM THE PRESIDENT?
I THINK THOSE PLUNGING NUMBERS AROUND AMERICAN PRIDE ARE TOTALLY REFLECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT WERE IN A POLARIZED NATION.
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS LEADING THROUGH DIVISION AND DISCORD.
YOURE SEEING THAT NUMBER INCREASE SLIGHTLY AMONG REPUBLICANS AND PLUNGE AMONG DEMOCRATS.
WERE A VERY DIVIDED SOCIETY.
BUT I WORRY TOO WHAT RONALD REAGAN WARNED ABOUT IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE ERADICATION OF THE AMERICAN MEMORY AND EAT RECOGNITION OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT.
BY WHICH HE MEANT WE ARE NOT  STUDYING CIVICS AND HISTORY IN OUR SCHOOLS ANYMORE.
WERE LOOKING ONLY AT THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP MEANS TO AMERICA NOT THE LARGER AMERICAN STORY.
I THINK IF AMERICANS MORE AMERICANS WERE TO UNDERSTOOD MORE ABOUT CIVICS AND AMERICAN HISTORY THEY WOULD HAVE PRIDE IN OUR NATION KNOWING THAT SOMETIMES WE GO THROUGH GOOD TIMES AND SOMETIMES WE GO THROUGH BAD TIMES BUT WE ARE A STRONG AND RESILIENT NATION ULTIMATELY.
ON THIS EVE OF THE FOURTH OF JULY THAT SEEMS AN APPROPRIATE SPOT TO END IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT MARK.
THANK YOU ASHLEY THANK YOU JENNIFER AND THANK YOU MONICA.
DO APPRECIATE YOUR REPORTING.
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.
CHILDREN LAYING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.
CELLS PACKED AT FIVE TIMES THEIR CAPACITY.
NEW IMAGES BEING RELEASED AS PART OF A GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG REPORT ON CONDITIONS INSIDE THOSE MIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES.
ITS TRIGGERING MORE OUTRAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
ILL TALK ABOUT IT WITH ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS WASHINGTON GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE WILL JOIN ME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BREAK.
LATER IN THIS HOUR ANOTHER CONTEND ARE OHIO CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN WILL ALSO JOIN ME.
HES GOT A WARNING FOR HIS PARTY ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
IT COULD MEAE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
i  LiMu Emu i i And Doug.i What do all these people have in common LiMu?
 guttural grunt  Exactly.
Nothing!
i Theyre completelyi i different people.i Thats why they make customized car insurance from Liberty Mutual.
Theyll only pay for what they need.
Yes and they could save a ton.
Youve done it again LiMu.
 LiMu grunts  i Only pay for what you need.i i  Liberty Libertyi i Liberty Liberty i Tell him were flexible.
Dont worry.
My Dutch is OK. Just OK?
Tell him we need this merger.
Its happening..!
i Just OK is not OK.i i Especially when it comes toi i your network.i iATT is Americas best wirelessi inetworki i according to Americas biggesti i test.i i Now with 5G Evolution.i i The First Step to 5G.i iMore for your thing.
Thats ouri ithing.i A DISTURBING NEW REPORT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HIGHLIGHTS THE CONDITIONS MIGRANTS ARE FACING AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER.
IT INCLUDES IMAGES OF PEOPLE AT A RIO GRANDE VALLEY DETENTION CENTER CRAMMED INTO HOLDING CELLS SLEEPING ON CONCRETE FLOORS.
ONE SENIOR MANAGER AT THAT FACILITY CALLS THE SITUATION A QUOTE TICKING TIME BOMB.
OFFICIALS FOUND ADULTS AND CHILDREN LIVING WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO SHOWERS.
AND ACCORDING TO THAT REPORT QUOTE AT ONE FACILITY SOME SINGLE ADULTS WERE HELD IN STANDING ROOM ONLY CONDITIONS FOR A WEEK AND AT ANOTHER SOME SINGLE ADULTS WERE HELD FOR MORE THAN A MONTH IN OVERCROWDED CELLS.
JOINING ME NOW LIVE FROM SEATTLE WASHINGTON GOVERNOR AND POLITICAL EXCUSE ME DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JAY INSLEE.
GOVERNOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
AS PRESIDENT WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT THESE DETENTION FACILITIES?
HOW WOULD THEY CHANGE?
WE WOULD SHOP THE GROSS INHUMANITY.
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH AND DEPRAVITY OF DONALD TRUMP.
THESE CONDITIONS ARE AN INTENTIONAL ACTION BY HIM.
HE HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID AND HE LIKES THESE INHUMANE CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT IS PART OF HIS INTENTION TO FAN THE FLAME OF DISCORD AROUND HIM AGGREGATION.
IMMIGRATION.
AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS IMMIGRATION PROBLEM TO KEEP PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE AND NOT FORCE THEM TO COME NORTH HE HAS DECIDED TO UTILIZE INHUMANE CONDITIONS AS A TOOL OF HIS GROSS CRUELTY.
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW DEEP THIS DEPRAVITY IS.
SO WE NEED TO HAVE BOTH ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE BUT WE NEED TO GO BACK WHAT WEVE DONE FOR 50 YEARS AS A JUDGE ORDERED YESTERDAY IN SEATTLE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED ON BOND IN THE APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEREAS MUCH AS 80 OR 90 OF PEOPLE DO RETURN FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION HEARINGS.
WEVE DONE THAT FOR 50 YEARS IN AMERICA.
HE HAS DEPARTED FROM AMERICAN TRADITION.
WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THAT.
ON LAST NIGHT FELLOW DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FORMER HOUSING SECRETARY JULIAN CASTRO APPEARED ON RACHEL MADDOW AND HE LAID OUT HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN.
LISTEN HAVE SOME IM GOING TO OFFER A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VISION ON WHAT WE SHOULD DO ON IMMIGRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THATS FIXED THAT WORKS WITH BORDER SECURITY BUT THAT NEVER TREATS PEOPLE LIKE THIS AGAIN.
I BELIEVE ONE CENTERPIECE OF THAT IS REPEALING SECTION 1325 OF THE IMMIGRATION NATIONAL ALT ACT SO THAT NOT ONLY THIS PRESIDENT BUT FUTURE PRESIDENTS CANT EVER USE THAT LAW TO INCARCERATE PARENTS AND SEPARATE THEM FROM THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN.
DO YOU AGREE WITH HIS STANCE THAT CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE CRIMINALIZED?
WE SHOULD NOT USE CRIMINAL STATUTES TO SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS PERIOD.
AND IF THATS BEING USED FOR THAT PURPOSE IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.
AND IS NOT REQUIRED.
LOOK WE HAVE LOTS OF CIVIL SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT ILLEGAL ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES.
AND TO USE DONALD TRUMPS SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM PARENTS WHICH HE HAS DONE INTENTIONALLY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED THROUGH CRIMINAL STATUTES IN THE UNITED STATES.
AND I WANT TO REPEAT LOOK FOR 50 YEARS WEVE HAD A SYSTEM OF BEING ABLE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE A HEARING ON ASYLUM WITHOUT SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS.
WE NEED TO RESTORE THAT BASIC AMERICAN VALUE.
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING FROM THE NEW WASHINGTON POST ABC NEWS POLL THAT WAS TAKEN SINCE LAST WEEKS NBC DEBATE.
29 OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS SAY HEALTHCARE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THEYRE GOING TO BE VOTING ON.
TOP OF THE LIST IN FACT.
YOU HAVE RELIED HEAVILY ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOUVE DRILLED DOWN ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
WHAT DO YOU OFFER VOTERS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO TACKLE OUR NATIONS HEALTHCARE ISSUES?
WELL WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH IN OUR STATE SUCCESSFULLY NOT JUST IN CLIMATE ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS.
WEVE ADOPTED THE VERY FIRST PUBLIC HEALTH OPTION IN THE UNITED STATES.
WERE PROUD OF THAT.
IM THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO PASS THOSE BILLS.
BUT WEVE DONE SO MUCH ON OUR OTHER ISSUES TO HELP FAMILIES HEALTH.
HEALTH IS NOT JUST THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM YOUVE GOT TO HAVE A FAMILY WAGE.
THATS WHY IM PROUD TO SAY WEVE ADOPTED WHILE IM GOVERNOR THE HIGHEST MINIMUM WAGE IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY WHEN THEYRE SICK.
THATS WHY WE HAVE THE MOST ROBUST MEDICAL FAMILY LEAVE IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DECENT WAGE IN GENERAL THATS WHY IM PROUD OF WEVE WON THE HIGHEST EDUCATOR COMPENSATION INCREASE FOR OUR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS IN THE UNITED STATES.
WE HAVE WRAPAROUND SERVICES OF BEING ABLE TO BUILD A MIDMIDDLE CLASS.
THATS HOW YOU REALLY HAVE HEALTH.
BUT I DO WANT TO COME BACK TO THIS ISSUE.
LOOK THIS IS A HEALTH ISSUE OF THIS CLIMATE CRISIS.
ITS INCREASING LYME DISEASE ITS RESPIRATORY DISTRESS ITS AN EPIDEMIC OF AS ASTHMA.
THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS A HEALTH ISSUE AND IM OFFERING A UNIQUE EMPHASIS TON.
I AM THE CANDIDATE AND SO FAR THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO SAID THIS WILL BE THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF THE UNITED STATES.
ITS A HEALTH ISSUE ITS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE ALL ROLLED IN ONE.
ITS YOUR CENTRAL MESSAGE.
YOU BET.
THE LATEST MSNBC POLL SHOWS YOUR MOVEMENT OVER THE LAST FOUR MONTHS IT SHOWS IN MARCH APRIL AND JUNE YOU WERE REGISTERING AT ABOUT 1.
IN THE MOST RECENT PERCENT YOURE NOT AT AN AS SPER RISK.
ASTERISK?
IS IT THAT MESSAGE OR IS IT ABOUT THE MESS SEN JER.
WHERE WERE CLINTON AND CARTER WERE WHEN THEY STARTED.
WERE STILL INTRODUCING OURSELVES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE COULD PICK ME OUT OF A LINEUP IN THE IS A START.
WEVE HAD SOME CONFIDENCE SINCE THE LAST DEBATE.
WE HAD A SURGE OF SUPPORT.
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF DONORS IN 24 HOURS SINCE I STARTED.
WE HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF NEW DONORS.
AND WE ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO GO TO JNZ.COM IF THEY WANT TO SEE THE CLIMATE CRISIS TO REMAIN A CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE DEBATE.
YOURE TALKING NUMBERS HERE YOUVE GOT SOME FUNDRAISING NUMBERS FOR US?
YEAH.
THEYRE GOING UP.
I DONT HAVE A TOTAL NUMBER FOR YOU.
I HAVENT TOTALED THEM FOR THE QUARTER.
BUT WE DID HAVE THE BEST DAY TWO DAYS THAT WEVE HAD DURING THE CAMPAIGN AFTER THE LAST DEBATE.
AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE CLIMATE CRISIS FRONT AND CENTER.
YESTERDAY SENATOR SANDERS PUT OUT HIS NUMBERS HE WAS AROUND 24 MILLION.
PETE PUT OUT HIS NUMBERS AROUND 24 MILLION.
ARE YOU AT 24 MILLION.
NO.
BY THE WAY I WAS HONORED THE OTHER DAY SOMEONE EVALUATED OUR RESPECTIVE CLIMATE PLANS AND OURS WAS HELD TO BE NUMBER ONE IM PROUD OF THAT.
I THINK THATS WHATS NECESSARY IS FOR OUR NATION TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THATS BURNING DOWN OUR TOWNS AND PLANNED TOING OUR FIELDS.
ALL RIGHT.
AND IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THAT THEY CAN GO TO JNZ.COM.
GOVERNOR INSLEE THANK YOU.
YOU BET.
TOP TIER SHUFFLE.
HOW THE LATEST POST NBC NEWS DEBATE POLL SHAKING UP SOME OF THE TOP CONTENDERS AS JOE BIDEN REMAINS AT THE TOP SPOT.
WELL GO LIVE TO IOWA WHERE A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES ARE HITTING THE GROUND FOR THE HOLIDAY.
WELL CATCH UP WITH OUR ROAD WARRIORS IN THE HAWKEYE STATE IN THE IS A LIVE LOOK AT DES MOINES.
E STATE IN THE IS A LIVE LOOK AT DES MOINES i Corey is living withi i metastatic breast canceri i which is breast canceri i that has spreadi i to other parts of her body.i i Shes also taking IBRANCEi i with an aromatase inhibitori i which is for postmenopausali i womeni i or for men with HR  HER2i i metastatic breast canceri i as the first hormonali i based therapy.i i IBRANCE plus letrozole wasi i significantly more effectivei i at delaying disease progressioni i versus letrozole.i i Patients taking IBRANCEi i can developi i low white blood cell countsi i which may causei i serious infectionsi i that can lead to death.i iBefore taking IBRANCE tell youri i doctor if you have feveri i chills or other signsi i of infectioni i liver or kidney problemsi i are pregnant breastfeedingi i or plan to become pregnant.i i Common side effects includei i low red blood celli i and low platelet countsi i infections tirednessi i nausea sore mouthi i abnormalities ini i liver blood testsi idiarrhea hair thinning or lossi i vomiting rash andi i loss of appetite.i i Corey calls it her new normali i because a lot has changedi i but a lot hasnt.i i Ask your doctori i about IBRANCE.i i The 1 prescribed FDAapprovedi i oral combination treatmenti i for HRHER2MBC.i iThis is the story of John Smith.i i Not this John Smith.i i Or this John Smith.i any of the otheri i hundreds of John Smithsi i that are Humana Medicarei i Advantage members.i i No its this John Smith.i i Who we paired with a Humanai i team member to help addressi i his own specific health needs.i i At Humana we take a personali i approach to your healthi i to provide care thats justi i as unique as you are.i i No matter what your name is.i i  LiMu Emu i i And Doug.i What do all these people have in common LiMu?
i No matter what your name is.i  guttural grunt  Exactly.
Nothing!
i Theyre completelyi i different people.i Thats why they make customized car insurance from Liberty Mutual.

Yes and they could save a ton.
Youve done it again LiMu.
 LiMu grunts  i Only pay for what you need.i i  Liberty Libertyi i Liberty Liberty i RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE SWARMING IOWA PREPARING FOR A LONG HOLIDAY WEEKEND.
THERES A LOOK AT THEM THERE.
NEW POLL FROM THE WASHINGTON POST AND ABC NEWS SHEDS SOME LIGHT ON HOW THEY ARE STACKING UP AT THIS EARLY POINT IN THE RACE.
AND THE LATEST POLL SINCE THE NBC NEWS DEBATE JOE BIDENS LEAD OVER HIS CLOSEST COMPETITOR SHRANK TO JUST SIX POINT.
BERNIE SANDERS HOLDING ON TO THE SECOND SPOT IN THE POLL.
ELIZABETH WARREN HOLDING STEADY AT 11.
BIGGEST JUMP SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS ALSO AT 11.
BUT THIS POLL IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT ALSO ASKS IT ASKS VOTERS FOR A SECOND CHOICE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHETHER ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES IS SOMEONES FIRST OR SECOND CHOICE JOE BIDEN HAS THE SUPPORT OF HALF THE PRIMARY VOTERS AND THATS WITH MORE THAN 20 PEOPLE IN THIS RACE.
SANDERS HITS 40 ELIZABETH WARREN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE KAMALA HARRIS RIGHT THERE AS WELL 24.
WE HAVE TWO ROAD WARRIORS COVERING TWO OF THE BIGGEST MOVERS IN ALL OF THESE POLLS RIGHT NOW.
MIKE IS COVERING THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS HE IN CEDAR RAPIDS IOWA.
VAUGHN HILLYARD COVERING THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IN DES MOINES IOWA.
MIKE ILL START WITH YOU IF THE THIS IS BIDENS FIRST CAMPAIGN RALLY SINCE THOSE DEBATES.
WHATS THE PLAN?
WELL CRAIG THERES NO DOUBT THAT A LOT HAS CHANGED FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF WHAT IS HIS THIRD TRIP TO IOWA SINCE ANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY IN APRIL.
HE WAS BEHIND ME HERE IN CEDAR RAPIDS ON THAT FIRST TRIP IN APRIL SAYING AT THE TIME THAT NO ONE WAS GOING TO WORK HARDER THAN HIM TO WIN THE SUCH IOWA VOTERS.
THAT SECOND TRIP TO IOWA YOULL REMEMBER HE WAS HERE AT THE SAME TIME AS PRESIDENT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
GAVE BIDEN AND OPPORTUNITY TO FRAME THAT GENERAL ELECTION MATCHUP OF COURSE ELECTABILITY BEING ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT HE HAS SO FAR.
BUT AS I SAID THERES NO DOUBT WHEN YOU TALK TO BIDEN ADVISERS THEY FEEL THE GAME HAS CHANGED.
GAME ON AS ONE ADVISER SAID.
YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE POLLS THAT SHOW HIM SLIPPING AFTER THAT SHAKY DEBATE PERFORMANCE.
SENIOR BIDEN CAMPAIGN ADVISER TELLS ME WERE NO MORE WORRIED ABOUT THESE LATEST POLLS THAT SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF A DIP THAN THEY WERE OVERCONFIDENT BASED ON THE INITIAL POLLS THAT SHOWED HIM WITH A STRONG LEAD.
BUT WE ARE SEEING HIM RECOGNIZE THAT HE CANT JUST STAY ABOVE THE FRAY IN TERMS OF THE RUN THE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.
WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING WERE GOING TO SEE HIM CAMPAIGNING ON THE FOURTH OF JULY TOMORROW IN INDEPENDENCE IOWA AT THE SAME TIME AS BETO OROURKE.
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS CONTENDERS.
ALSO CRAIG TOMORROW NIGHT JOE BIDEN WILL ALSO BE ATTENDING AN IOWACUBS GAME WITH BETO AROARK.
WHICH MEANS I GET PAID TO ATTEND A BASEBALL GAME.
GOOD POINT.
MR. HILLYARD HOW ARE THEY GOING TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS?
SHELL BE JUST NEXT DOOR IN WEST DES MOINES THIS AFTERNOON AND THEN SHELL BE GOING FROM IOWA TO TO NEW ORLEANS AND IN SOUTH CAROLINA NEXT WEEK.
ESSENTIALLY SHES NOT GOING TO LET UP OFF THE GAS.
SHES GOING TO GO FORWARD.
AND THIS IS PART OF THE CAMPAIGNS EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO SHOW THE CONTRAST OF WHAT KAMALA HARRIS CAN BRING TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
SHE PLANS TO GO FULL ON.
THEY NOW HAVE 65 STAFFERS HERE ON THE GROUND IN IOWA.
AND AS MIKE JUST MENTIONED THE DEBATE WAS A WAKEUP CALL FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN THAT HE COULDNT STAY ABOVE THE FRAY.
BECAUSE WHAT LAST WEEK SHOWED IS THIS IS GOING TO BE A DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN WHICH CANDIDATES WILL SHOW CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM.
KAMALA HARRIS NOT ONLY ON ISSUES OF RACE AND BUSING BUT ALSO ON THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS DEPORTATION POLICIES.
I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT OF SOUND.
THIS WAS ACTUALLY FROM JUST OVER A WEEK AGO WHEN KAMALA HARRIS WAS OVER IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
I THINK ITS VERY PERTINENT TO WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA SENATOR TODAY AND IN THE WEEKS AHEAD.
WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO REBUILD THE PARTY.
WHO UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO GIVE THE RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY DOING THE HARD WORK.
WE CANT JUST HELICOPTER IN HERE.
WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE GROUND WHO KNOW THE COMMUNITY.
KAMALA HARRIS IN THAT DEBATE MADE HERSELF VULNERABLE TO FOLKS TO VOTERS WHO SAY THEY ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT DEMOCRATS ATTACK ONE ANOTHER.
BUT WHAT SHE DID AT THE SAME TIME AND WHAT THE POLLS ARE INDICATING SHE SEPARATED HERSELF AS A WILLINGNESS TO PAINT CONTRAST BETWEEN HER AND OTHERS.
AND AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM HER THERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TO HEAR FROM HER HERE IN IOWA IS THAT SHE IS MAINTAINING SHE IS THE CANDIDATE THATS LOOKING FORWARD AND WILL OUTWORK THE REST OF THE FIELD.
CRAIG.
ALL RIGHT.
VAUGHN HILLYARD THERE IN DES MOINES.
THANK YOU.
AND MIKE THANK YOU AS WELL SIR.
WILL THEY OR WONT THEY?
A NEW TWEET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST MOMENTS AGO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION ON A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE CENSUS.
WERE GOING TO DIG INTO THAT.
ITS A DEVELOPING STORY.
ALSO THE NEWEST ROUND OF POST NBC NEWS DEBATE POLLS SUGGEST THAT THAT SOME CANDIDATES MIGHT BE IN MORE TROUBLE WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING THE DEBATE STAGE.
ONE OF THOSE CONTENDERS HITTING THE GROUND IN IOWA THIS WEEK.
CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN WILL JOIN US AHEAD.
S WEEK CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN WILL JOIN US AHEAD  I want it that way... I cant believe it.

MOMENTS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK TO TWITTER TO SAY THAT HE WILL DEFY HIS OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE COURTS ON THE CENSUS.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT THE CENSUS WILL HAVE A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION.
NBC WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT KELLY ODONNELL IS HERE TO TRY TO CLEAR THIS UP.
HEY KELLY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS NO PRESIDENT SAYS YES.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHATS HAPPENING.
Reporter WELL ITS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED AND WHAT THIS REALLY GETS DOWN TO IS THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT LIKE THIS DECISION.
AND THIS OF COURSE IS THE PRESIDENT WHO ARGUES FORCEFULLY THAT ASKING THOSE WHO REPLY TO THE 2020 CENSUS IF THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF DATA ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT A CENSUS COLLECTS.
WHAT WE LEARNED LATE TUESDAY YESTERDAY WAS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE COMMERCE WERE GOING FORWARD WITH PRINTING OF THE 2020 QUESTIONNAIRE WITHOUT THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION.
NOW IS THERE SOME GRAY AREA HERE?
YOU CAN KEEP A LEGAL CHALLENGE GOING WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS ARGUING FOR HERE.
AND AT THE SAME TIME TAKE THE PRAGMATIC STEP OF PRINTING THE UP IN CENSUS AND DOING IT LAWFULLY WITHOUT THAT CITIZENSHIP QUESTION NOW BECAUSE OF THE ENORMITY OF THE TASK OF DOING THE 2020 CENSUS.
SO WHAT WE NEED SOME CLARIFICATION ON IS IS THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY DEFYING THIS PLAN TO PRINT OR IS HE ARGUING FOR CONTINUING THE LEGAL CASE?
WHICH AT THE PUSHED IT BACK TO THE LOWER COURT SAYING THE REASONS GIFG GIVEN BISECT WILBUR ROSS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ADDING THIS QUESTION AND IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP LITIGATING.
BUT THEYRE RUNNING UP AGAINST A TIME DEADLINE BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION NOT JUST ANY ORDINARY LAW BUT THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT A CENSUS BE TAKEN EVERY TEN YEARS.
SO WERE UP AGAINST THAT DEADLINE.
IS IT PRAGMATISM MEETS POLITICS?
A PRESIDENT THATS BEEN ACTIVE TON TWITTER TODAY PUSHING BACK?
THIS DECISION BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND CONGRESS THAT WE LEARNED LATE YESTERDAY FOLLOWED WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE PRESIDENT ARGUING PRETTY FORCEFULLY THAT HE WANTED TO KEEP FIGHTING THIS.
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS SORT OF BEEN PUSHED BACK ON HIS HEELS WITH THIS.
HES CALLING IT FAKE NEWS.
WE HAVE OFFICIALS IN BOTH DEPARTMENTS WHO TOLD US THE PLAN IS TO GO FORWARD WITH THE PRINTING.
SO IS HE ADVOCATING FOR THE COURT CASE TO GO ON?
IS THIS JUST SORT OF A POLITICAL MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT?
TO OUR UNDERSTANDING THE CENSUS QUESTION THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS NOT IN THE UP IN PRINTING THAT WILL BE ORDERED FAIRLY SHORTLY.
CRAIG.
KELLY ODONNELL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
THANK YOU.
IM JOINED NOW BY SENIOR CORRESPONDENT FOR NPR BOSTON AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR KIMBERLY ATKINS.
ALSO WITH ME ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY.
LEAH THANK YOU LADIE BOTH FOR BEING WITH ME.
APPARENTLY THE PRINTER IS INSTRUCTED TO START THE PROCESS.
WHATS GOING ON HERE LEAH?
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON HERE.
FIRST WE SEE AGAIN THAT THE PRESIDENT IS COMPLETELY AT ODDS WITH OTHER FACTIONS OR OTHER AGENCIES OR DIVISIONS DEPARTMENTS WITHIN HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION.
SO IT RAISES THE QUESTION YOU KNOW WHOS IN CHARGE HERE?
WHOS RUNNING THE SHOW?
THE OTHER THING TOO THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING AND THIS MAY BE SABER RAD RATTLING AND SHOWING A HARD POLITICAL MESSAGE THAT HE MEANS BUSINESSTOR MAY BE SERIOUS.
BUT HES SPECIALLY SAYING IM GOING TO GO AGAINST THIS AND GO AGAINST THE COURTS RULING AND MY OWN JUST DEPARTMENT AND IM GOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT QUESTION FINDS ITS WAY ON THERE.
SO HES PROMISING TO REALLY UPHOLD THE YOU KNOW THIS QUESTION ABOUT CITIZENSHIP AND CHANGE THE CENSUS.
NOW CAN HE DO THAT?
ITS NOT EXACTLY CLEAR.
HOW WOULD HE DO THAT.
BUT HES ESSENTIALLY PROMISING DO THAT.
AND THAT IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
KIMBERLY I THINK FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING AND WHO ARE LISTENING ON SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO WHO PERHAPS HAVENT BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY AS CLOSELY MAYBE WE SHOULD REMIND THEM WHY IS IT THAT THIS PRESIDENT FINDS THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ITSELF WHY DOES HE WANT THIS TO BE A PART OF THIS CENSUS SO VERY BADLY?
WELL ITS A COUPLE OF POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS CRAIG.
ONE IS THAT WHEN THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS ON THE CENSUS THERE IS RESEARCH THAT WOULD SAY THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK TO SUPPRESS PARTICIPATION IN THE CENSUS AND GET AN UNDERCOUNT PARTICULARLY NOT JUST OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS BUT EVEN CITIZENS WHO ARE RELATED TO IMMIGRANTS HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE OF MIXED IMMIGRATION STATUS WITHIN THEIR HOUSEHOLD.
THERE WILL BE A FEAR THAT PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS COULD GET THEM IN TROUBLE.
WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT DOCUMENTATION AND THE LITIGATION OVER THE CENSUS THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO KNOW THAT THAT WOULD HURT DEMOCRATS IN AN ELECTION.
I MEAN THE CENSUS DECIDES A LOT OF THINGS FROM CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS TO FEDERAL FUNDING BUT IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ELECTION COULD A DEPRESSED TURNOUT AND DEPRESS THE STRENGTH OF THE DEMOCRATIC DISTRICTS.
SO THERES A POLITICAL INCENTIVE HERE.
IVE TALKED TO STATE OFFICIALS WHO HAVE SAID EVEN WITH THE CENSUS QUESTION NOT ON THE CENSUS THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH DISCUSSION SO MANY DIVISIVENESS OVER THIS ISSUE THAT THEY ARE STILL FEARING THAT THERE WILL BE AN UNDERCOUNT.
AND THAT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE STATES WHO DEPEND ON THE CENSUS FOR THEIR FEDERAL FUNDING.
ALSO IN THE NEWS TODAY OF COURSE THESE TROUBLING IMAGES THAT WE ARE GETTING THANKS TO THAT WATCHDOG GROUP OF THE MIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS FROM INSIDE THESE MIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS.
I ASKED PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL JAY INSLEE JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO ABOUT HIS PLAN FOR IMMIGRATION.
AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMPS STRATEGY ON IMMIGRATION.
LEAH KIMBERLY THIS IS WHAT HE SAID.
HE HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID AND HE LIKES THESE INHUMANE CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT IS PART OF HIS INTENTION TO FAN THE FLAME OF DISCORD AROUND IMMIGRATION.
AND INSTEAD OF UNITING US TO FIND A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS IMMIGRATION PROBLEM TO KEEP PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE AND NOT FORCE THEM TO COME NORTH HE HAS DECIDED TO UTILIZE INHUMANE CONDITIONS AS A TOOL OF HIS GROSS CRUELTY.
LEAH IS WHAT WERE SEEING IS IT THE PRESIDENTS STRATEGY OR IS IT THE RESULT OF A FAILED STRATEGY?
SO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER IS YES TO BOTH.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS EMERGED OR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS IS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY VERY DIRECT IN SOME WAYS IN SOME WAYS NOT TO DIRECT BUT HAS BEEN PRETTY DIRECT ABOUT SAYING THAT THEIR SEPARATION POLL VIS ARE THEIR POLICIES AROUND THE BORDER THESE DETENTION CENTER POLICIES HAVE BEEN MADE TO DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM COME TOGETHER BORDER.
AND ITS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
AND WEVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION IN THE TREATMENT THESE CENTERS AND THEN KIND OF POOR CONDITIONS.
WEVE SEEN THE ADMINISTRATION ARGUING IN FAVOR OF POOR CONDITIONS.
NOW THE BIGGER THING I THINK AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A QUESTION FOR MOST DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES MOVING INTO INTO PRIMARY DEBATES AND INTO THE GENERAL ELECTION IS WELL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO FIX IT?
WHAT IS THE POLICY ON IMMIGRATION ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEE CENTERS AND THEN THE CONDITIONS THESE PEOPLE ARE FACING.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ITS UNSUSTAINABLE.
AS A POLITICAL STRATEGY PERHAPS ITS WORKING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMPS SUPPORTERS BUT FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IT ABSOLUTELY IS NOT WORKING.
KIMBERLY LETS TALK POLITICS FOR JUST A SECOND HERE.
AND THEN MAYOR PETE SPECIFICALLY.
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HIS FUNDRAISING NUMBERS DURING OUR LAST SEGMENT.
BERNIE SANDERS AS WELL PUT UP ABOUT 24 MILLION.
ACTUALLY BERNIE SANDERS TRANSFERRED ABOUT 6 MILLION HE RAISED ROUGHLY 18.
BUT MAYOR PETE RAISED CLOSE TO 25 MILLION.
THATS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE FOR A SECOND QUARTER.
BUT  YEAH.
YOU LOOK AT HIS POLLING AND THE TWO DONT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE.
WHY WHY IS HE NOT POLLING BETTER IF HE IS RAISING SO MUCH MONEY?
WELL A FEW REASONS.
IVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE RAISING MONEY FOR MAYOR PETE AS HE TRAVELS TO PLACES INCLUDING MASSACHUSETTS THIS UPCOMING WEEKEND.
AND THEY SAY THAT ON THE GROUND HE IS RESONATING WITH FOLKS.
THEYRE DOING A COMBINATION OF THESE BIGDOLLAR FUNDRAISERS THAT FOLKS LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO DO.
BUT ALSO DOING THE SMALLERDOLLAR DONATIONS IN ORDER TO ENERGIZE YOUNGER PEOPLE REALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET TO KNOW HIM.
AND IT HAS BEEN LITERALLY PAYING OFF.
NOW ONE THING THAT RAISING THIS MONEY WILL DO WILL ALLOW HIM TO STAY IN THE RACE LONGER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES AND GIVE HIM MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD HIS PROFILE GET OUT WITH ADS AND RAISE HIS PROFILE.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST DONT KNOW WHO HE IS OR WHAT HES ABOUT YET.
AND THAT COULD HAPPEN.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HES HAD A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME RESONATING WITH VOTERS OF COLOR.
WE KNOW THAT FOR DEMOCRATS THAT SAY CRUCIAL CRUCIAL BLOCK.
HE HAD THE ISSUE WITH THE POLICE SHOOTING.
YEAH.
IN SOUTH BEND.
AND SO THAT IS A BIG THATS A BIG OBSTACLE THAT HES GOING TO HAVE TO OVERCOME.
BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW HE HAS THE FUNDS TO STAY IN IT.
KIMBERLY ATKINS LEAH ENJOY THE HOLIDAY LADIES.
THANK YOU OR YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU.
ESE HES BEEN EXTREMELY VOCAL ABOUT WINNING BACK THOSE VOTERS THAT SWUNG TO TRUMP.
CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN SOUNDING OFF ON THE EFFECT THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE COULD HAVE ON THE RACE.
CONGRESSMAN RYAN JOINS ME AFTER THE BREAK.
E RACE CONGRESSMAN RYAN JOINS ME AFTER THE BREAK.
i Nothing feels like connectingi i with the people that matter.i i Holiday Inn.i i Holiday Inn Express.i i Were there.i i So you can be too.i I have one kid in each branch of the military but Im command central.
Its so important to us that Verizon is supporting military families.
When I have a child deployed having a reliable network means everything.
So when I get a video chat and I get to see their face its the best thing in the world.
And Ive earned every one of these gray hairs.
Military moms we serve too.
The network more people rely on gives you more.
Like military plans with a special price on Unlimited 100 per line and big savings on our best phones when you switch.
Thats Verizon.
Think all premium fuels are the same?
New Shell VPower NiTRO Premium Gasoline is engineered with four levels of defense against gunk wear corrosion and friction.
That helps keep your engine running like new.
So maybe its time to unthink what you think about premium fuel.
Shell VPower NiTRO Premium Gasoline...
Its Fuel For Thought.
MAKING THE OVERCROWDED AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS REVEALED IN THESE MIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES A NATIONAL FOCAL POINT.
IM JOINED NOW BY OHIO DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TIM RYAN.
CONGRESSMAN WE HAVE ALL SEEN THESE PICTURES NOW AND WEVE HEARD SOME OF THE HEARTBREAKING STORIES OF THE MIGRANTS FROM THE DETENTION FACILITIES.
A NUMBER OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE VISITED AND RELEASED SOME DETAILED PLANS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM.
I DONT BELIEVE YOUVE DONE EITHER JUST YET.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
DO WITH THESE DETENTION FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY FACILITIES THAT ARE PRIVATELY OPERATED?
GO AHEAD.
YEAH WE SHOULD NOT BE LOCKING THESE PEOPLE UP IN THE WAY WERE DOING IT.
CRAIG ITS ATROCIOUS.
I THINK IT GOES AGAINST OUR VALUES.
I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE  I WISH THE PRESIDENT WOULD ASK DOCTORS AND NURSES TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE BORDER AND START HELPING ADMINISTER SOME CARE TO THESE PEOPLE.
JAMMING THEM IN THESE FACILITIES I MEAN THIS IS STUNNING TO THINK THAT THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
AND ITS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY THAT WE HAVE ACROSS OUR SOCIETY TODAY CRAIG.
I MEAN EVERYONE IS TELLING US THINGS ARE GOING REALLY GOOD BUT YET EVERYBODY FEELS REALLY BAD.
AND THIS ANXIETY JUST WATCHING THESE THINGS HAPPEN LET ALONE IF YOURE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOWN THERE IS JUST HEARTBREAKING.
AND WERE THE UNITED STATES.
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO DOWN THERE AND FIX THIS AND IT SHOULDNT TAKE THAT LONG.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON DAY ONE IF ELECTED ABOUT THIS SPECIFICALLY?
WELL MAKE SURE EVERYBODY COMING IN THROUGH THESE FACILITIES IS TAKEN CARE OF.
BUT THE KEY IS GOING TO BE TO GO TO CENTRAL AMERICA AND ACTUALLY STABILIZE THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE MIGRATING FROM.
THE PRESIDENT IS THE DISTRACTER IN CHIEF.
HE CANT FOCUS FOR MORE THAN FIVE SECONDS.
THE ISSUE IS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
IVE BEEN SAYING THIS NOW FOR MONTHS.
WE NEED TO GO TO CENTRAL AMERICA STABILIZE THOSE COUNTRIES.
KICK THE GANGS OUT.
WE DONT EVEN HAVE AN AMBASSADOR IN HONDURAS RIGHT NOW.
THE PRESIDENT IS CUTTING THE STATE DEPARTMENT FUNDING THAT WOULD HELP US REPAIR WHAT IS HAPPENING DOWN THERE.
THATS THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM.
THATS WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM.
AND IF WE WANT TO END THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER WE NEED TO GO DEAL WITH THE HEART OF THE MATTER.
THE CANDIDATES OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND HERE YOU ARE IN IOWA.
YOURE IN IOWA RIGHT NOW.
WOULD LOO.
THERES A NEW POLL OF IOWA VOTERS FROM AFTER NBCS DEBATE LAST WEEK.
THE THE POLL IS JUST OUT.
THREE OF THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEBATES NEW YORK MAYOR BILL de BLASIO OHIO REPRESENTATIVE TIM RYAN AND CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL FAILED TO ATTRACT A SINGER SUPPORTER.
THATS OF 500 PEOPLE IN IOWA WHO WERE SURVEYED CONGRESSMAN.
DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO STAY IN THIS RACE?
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
I MEAN LITERALLY OUR PHONE HAS BEEN RINGING OFF THE HOOK SINCE THE DEBATE.
WEVE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE LEANING TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO ARE CALLING US AND THEY WANT TO MEET.
WEVE HAD SOME OF THE BEST FUNDRAISING DAYS WEVE HAD SINCE THE DEBATE.
SO I THINK WE CONNECTED.
CLEARLY THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION WAS AROUND SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I THINK THESE POLLS AT THIS POINT ARE ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS.
YOU CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT WINNERS FROM THE LAST 40 YEARS AND AT SOME POINT THEY WERE WHERE I AM NOW.
AND I THINK WEVE GOT THE MESSAGE.
WERE CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE AROUND THE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND FEAR THATS FACING THEM.
WHETHER ITS THE ECONOMIC ANXIETY WHETHER ITS AROUND HEALTH CARE WHETHER ITS AROUND WHAT WERE WATCHING HAPPEN AT THE BORDER WHETHER ITS WHATS HAPPENING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR SOIL AND THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING ENVIRONMENTALLY.
WERE CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE CRAIG AND PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW IM ASKING PEOPLE TO COME TO TIM RYAN FOR AMERICA.COM BE A PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN.
WE JUST RELEASED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AGENDA TO HELP WITH TRAUMABASED CARE FOR OUR KIDS AND SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND WRAPAROUND THERAPY.
SO WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THE BIG ISSUES IN MY CAMPAIGN AND THATS WHY PEOPLE ARE GETTING ON BOARD.
YOU JUST MENTIONED FUNDRAISING.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU RAISED IN THE SECOND QUARTER?
WELL WE DONT HAVE I THE NUMBERS RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR BEST DAYS WERE RIGHT AFTER THE DEBATE.
AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND WEVE DONE REALLY WELL INTO JULY.
SO WERE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
24 MILLION?
WERE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
IM REALLY PLEASED WITH IT.
MAYOR PETE HAS ABOUT 25 MILLION.
BERNIE SANDERS PUT OUT HIS NUMBERS YESTERDAY AT 24 MILLION.
ARE WE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?
WE ARE NOT IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.
I MEAN HERES THE DEAL CRAIG.
IM FROM NORTHEAST OHIO.
IM NOT FROM A BIG CITY.
STATE.
I DONT HAVE AN IVY LEAGUE EDUCATION OR NETWORK THAT I CAN TAP INTO.
SO WERE YOU KNOW DOING IT THE WAY IT HAS TO BE DONE AND THATS GRASS ROOTS BUILDING THIS BRING BRICK BY BRICK.
WERE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
WE JUST STARTED A WHOLE TEACHERS FOR TIM INITIATIVE AROUND TEACHERS WHO ARE COMING ON BOARD.
WERE BUILDING THIS THING OUT.
ITS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER ITS JULY.
BILL CLINTON DIDNT GET IN THIS RACE UNTIL OCTOBER.
SO WE ARE WAY AHEAD OF THE GAME HERE COMPARED TO PAST YEARS.
CONGRESSMAN THANK YOU.
AND ENJOY THE 4th.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AHEAD IN THE NEXT HOUR MY COLLEAGUE ANDREA MITCHELL IS GOING TO HAVE MORE ON THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE PRESIDENTS PLANNED 4th OF JULY EVENT.
