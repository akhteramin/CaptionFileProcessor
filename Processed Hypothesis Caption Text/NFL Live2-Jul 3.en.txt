 IT RIGHT WAS THE SQUAD ITSELF.
AFTER THE GAME THEY POASTD A VIDEO OF MOST OF THE TEAM DANCING TO THE 2007 BANGER.
IF YOU DONT KNOW IT THAT SUCKS FOR YOU.
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS SONG IS WHAT BRINGS THIS TEAM TOGETHER IS AMAZING.
IN THE NAME OF THE GROUP WHO MADE IT PROBABLY DESCRIBED BOTH COUNTRIES HISTORIES OF MONEY MAKING QUITE WELL CRIME MOB.
GOD BLESS THEM AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.
NFL LIVE IS NEXT.
WERE BACK ON JULY 11.
NFL LIVE PACKED WITH SPECIAL GUEST STARS TODAY.
JAGUARS QUARTERBACK JALEN RAMSEY JOINS THE SHOW LIVE.
TALK ABOUT HOW THE JAGS BOUNCE BACK THIS YEAR.
WELL TALK TO BROWNS TIGHT END DAVID NJOKU ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT IN CLEVELAND AND WHATS AHEAD FOR THE BROWNS.
SINCE TOMORROW IS INDEPENDENCE DAY WELL SHOW YOU SOME OF OF THE BEST INDEPENDENT PLAYS IN NFL HISTORY.
YOULL WANT TO STICK AROUND TO FIND OUT IF ONLY WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU CANT GET YOUR HOLIDAY WEEKEND STARTED WITHOUT HEARING 90 MORE MINUTES OF OFFSEASON CONTENT YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
DAVE GRAZIANO HERE.
WELL START WITH THE SITUATION REGARDING EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
THE COWBOYS SUPERSTAR RUNNING BACK MET TUESDAY WITH ROGER GOODELL TO DISCUSS A RECENT INCIDENT INVOLVING ELLIOTT AND A SECURITY GUARD IN LAS VEGAS.
ELLIOTT WAS DETAINED BUT NOT ARRESTED.
GIVEN HIS HISTORY WITH THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY THE COMMISSIONER CALLED HIM IN FOR A DISCUSSION.
FOLLOWING THAT DISCUSSION ELLIOTT POSTED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ON TWITTER.
EARLIER TODAY I MET WITH THE COMMISSIONER TO SHARE WITH HIM WHAT OCCURRED IN LAS VEGAS AND WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THAT INCIDENT.
IVE WORKED HARD TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AND LIVE UP TO THE HIGH STANDARDS EXPECTED OF ME.
I FAILED TO DO THAT HERE AND I MADE A POOR DECISION.
I APOLOGIZED TO KYLE JOHNSON THATS THE SECURITY GUARD IN QUESTION AT THE TIME AND I MEANT IT.
I NEED TO WORK HARDER TO ENSURE I DO NOT PUT MYSELF IN COMPROMISED SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE.
I AM REDEDICATING MYSELF TO USE ALL THE RESOURCES THE LEAGUE HAS MADE AVAILABLE.
IN THE END ITS UP TO ME AND I AM DETERMINED NOT TO BE IN THIS POSITION AGAIN.
WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL?
PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE WARNING COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL ISSUED TO ELLIOTT WHEN HE SUSPENDED HIM IN 2017.
IN HIS SUSPENSION LETTER AT THAT TIME GOODELL WROTE TO ELLIOTT YOU MUST HAVE NO FURTHER ADVERSE INVOLVEMENT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MUST NOT COMMIT ANY ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS OF LEAGUE POLICY.
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT ANOTHER VIOLATION MAY RESULT IN YOUR SUSPENSION OR POTENTIAL BANISHMENT FROM THE NFL.
LOOK WERE NOT HERE TO MAKE EQUATIONS OR COMPARISONS TO WHAT HE DID IN THE PAST AND WHAT HE DID NOW.
HERE HE IS MAKING THE WRONG HEADLINES AGAIN.
BEING CALLED INTO THE COMMISSIONERS OFFICE NO SMALL THING FOR A PLAYER IN HIS SITUATION.
MIKE IF YOURE IN THE FRONT OFFICE OF THIS TEAM AND YOU HAVE A PLAYER IN THIS SITUATION GOT THE CONTRACT SITUATION COMING UP OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATION DO YOU NEED TO HAVE WITH HIM AT THIS TIME.
YOU NEED TO HAVE A DIRECT HONEST AND VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION.
YOU HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THIS IS MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE.
AS YOU SAID DAN MAYBE ITS NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE ONE THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT FROM THE COWBOY ORGANIZATION I WOULD TELL HIM LOOK WERE GOING TO HIT PAUSE ON YOUR CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS.
THERES FOUR OTHER PLAYERS RIGHT NOW THAT THE COWBOYS HAVE DAK PRESCOTT THEIR STARTING QUARTERBACK AMARI COOPER WHO THEY TRADED FOR FROM THE OAKLAND RAIDERS JAYLEN SMITH AND BYRON JONES.
ALL FOUR OF THOSE PLAYERS ARE GOING FOR THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTRACTS.
THEY HAVE PLAYED WELL AND ACTED FLAWLESSLY OFF THE FIELD.
I HAVE HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH EZEKIEL ELLIOTT TO SAY WHILE WE APPRECIATE WHAT YOUVE DONE ON THE FIELD RIGHT NOW YOURE UNDER CONTRACT FOR THIS YEAR.
WE HAVE THE OPTION FOR 2020 AND WE CAN FRANCHISE YOU THE YEAR AFTER.
BASICALLY FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE CAN CONTROL YOUR RIGHTS.
BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOUVE ACTED WERE HITTING PAUSE AROUND IT MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR BUT THATS THE CONVERSATION YOU NEED TO HAVE WITH THE PLAYER.
STANDPOINT OF A TEAMMATE A GUY LIKE THIS IN THIS SITUATION WHAT CONVERSATION DO YOU HAVE?
LISTEN I THINK ITS IMPORTANT THAT YOURE AVAILABLE.
AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THE GUY WHO BASICALLY STIRS THE DRINK ISNT AVAILABLE YOURE AFFECTING MY MONEY.
YOURE AFFECTING EVERYBODY IN THE ORGANIZATION.
THINK ABOUT IT.
JASON GARRETT THIS IS LIKE HIS CONTRACT YEAR THIS IS HIS YEAR DO OR DIE YEAR AND YOURE PUTTING YOURSELF YOURE EZEKIEL ELLIOTT YOURE PUTTING YOURSELF IN A COMPROMISING SITUATION WHERE YOU COULD BE POTENTIALLY SUSPENDED ACHBD NOT AVAILABLE TO THE TEAM.
THERES SO MUCH RIDING ON THE DALLAS COWBOYS THIS YEAR ITS ALL HANDS ON DECK.
IF IM A VETERAN IN THE LOCKER ROOM LIKE DUDE LETS CHILL OUT CALM DOWN CANT KEEP PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE BECAUSE YOURE HURTING EVERYBODY NOT JUST YOURSELF.
DAMIAN TO YOUR POINT HOW EZEKIEL ELLIOTT STIRS THE DRINK.
LOOK AT DAK PRESCOTT HE HAS A PASSER RATING OF 122 WHEN ITS PLAY ACTION THE REASON ITS EFFECTIVE IS THE OPPOSING DEFENSE IS WORRYING ABOUT EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
THAT IS NOT BY COINCIDENCE THAT HAS A HIGH PASSING RATING WHEN THEYRE IN PLAY ACTION.
BECAUSE EVERYTHING WILL BE KEYED ON EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
IF HES NOT AVAILABLE AMARI COOPER WAS A VERY VALUABLE ACQUISITION.
WITHOUT EZEKIEL ELLIOTT THAT OFFENSE IS A LOT EASIER TO DEFEND.
NO QUESTION OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EZEKIEL ELLIOTT TO THE COWBOYS OFFENSE THEY STRUGGLED WITHOUT HIM IN 2017 WHEN HE WAS SUSPENDED.
WE AWAIT WORD FROM THE COMMISSIONERS OFFICE WHETHER HE FACES DISCIPLINE FOR THIS INCIDENT.
IF THAT COMES IN THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF WELL BRING IT TO YOU.
IN THE MEANTIME WERE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE SILLIER PORTION OF YOUR SHOW.
 LAUGHTER  THE 243rd ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
WE DIDNT HAVE ACCESS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON WE HAVE DAMIAN WOODY AND MIKE TANNENBAUM.
EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST CHOICE ON DECLARATION JEFFERSON COULDNT MAKE IT WEVE DECIDED TO ASK THEM FOR DECLARATIONS OF THEIR OWN.
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE IS SOMETHING YOU FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT SOMETHING YOU FEEL LIKE DECLARING ABOUT THE UPCOMING NFL SEASON.
IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE ABOUT LIFE LIBERTY OR THE PURSUIT OF APP HAPPINESS.
IT HAS TO BE ABOUT FOOTBALL.
DAMIAN WHATS YOUR FIRST DECLARATION OF THE DAY?
KIRK COUSINS WILL BE THE FIRST QUARTERBACK IN THE NFC NORTH THIS YEAR.
WHOA.
YES.
IM GOING OUT THERE ON KIRK COUSINS AND THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS.
I LOVE WHAT THE VIKINGS DID IN THE DRAFT.
ADDING A COUPLE PIECES UP FRONT IN THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
THEY HAVE ARGUABLY THE BEST WIDE RECEIVER TANDEM.
THEY DRAFTED IRV SMITH.
TIGHT END FROM ALABAMA TO GO ALONG WITH KYLE RUDOLPH.
EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW IS READY MADE.
MIKE T. IS TRYING TO JUMP IN ON THIS.
IM NOT GOING TO LET HIM.
I AM ADAMANT RIGHT NOW THAT KIRK COUSINS IS GOING TO GET IT DONE IN THE NFC NORTH THIS YEAR.
DONT MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL KIRK COUSINS.
THE NFL CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.
I GOT TWO WORDS.
AARON RODGERS.
I UNDERSTAND AARON RODGERS AND NFC NORTH.
I GOT MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT FOR AARON RODGERS.
BUT I ALSO LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT DID THE GREEN BAY PACKERS HOW MUCH ADDITION DID THE PACKERS ADD TO AARON RODGERS THEIR OFFENSE TO HELP AARON RODGERS THIS UPCOMING YEAR?
NOT MUCH.
I DIDNT SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING THIS YEAR.
LIKE I SAID WITH KIRK COUSINS THIS IS THE YEAR IN GETTING PAID A BOATLOAD OF MONEY.
THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS DRAFTED GUYS UP FRONT TO HELP THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
I THINK THIS IS THE YEAR THAT KIRK COUSINS MAKES A STATEMENT IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
IF HE DOES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE VIKINGS?
HOW FAR CAN THEY TAKE IT?
THEY CAN GO TO THE SUPER BOWL.
OH BOY.
IF YOU HAVE  IF THATS HOW WE DO DECLARATIONS  IF YOU HAVENT FIGURED IT OUT IM PRETTY BULLISH ON THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS.
DAMIAN WE KNOW THE SIGN OF A GREAT PLAYER WHEN THEY MAKE EVERYBODY AROUND THEM BETTER.
AARON RODGERS THAT HE COULD ELEVATE THE PLAY OF HIS TEAMMATES.
I AGREE MINNESOTA HAS HAD A GOOD OFFSEASON.
AT THE END OF THE DAY ISNT AARON RODGERS THE BETTER PLAYER THAN KIRK COUSINS.
COUSINS HAS THE HIGHEST COMPLETION PERCENTAGE THAN ANY NFC NORTH QUARTERBACK.
HE WAS ONLY 161 AGAINST TEAMS WITH WINNING RECORDS.
OBVIOUSLY GOT TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.
MIKE TANNENBAUM WHAT IS YOUR DECLARATION.
KYLE MURRAY WILL NOT PLAY IN HIS PLAY STYLE IS SIMILAR TO MARCUS MARIOTA.
MARCUS MARIOTA THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER NEVER PLAYED IN 16 GAMES.
WHILE KYLER MURRAY IS A DYNAMIC ATHLETE BECAUSE OF HIS BUILD I THINK AT SOME POINT ITS GOING TO BE HARD FOR HIM TO ANSWER THE BELL AT SOME SUNDAY THIS SEASON AND I CAN SEE HIM MISSING AT LEAST ONE GAME.
MY DECLARATION IS KYLER MURRAY BASED ON HIS SIZE BASED ON THE WAY HE PLAYS HE WILL NOT PLAY IN 16 GAMES.
A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT KYLER MURRAY.
IN ARIZONA THE FIRST YEAR.
HE IS A SCRAMBLER.
HE SCRAMBLED 41 TIMES NINTH MOST OF ANY FBS QUARTERBACK.
THATS GOING TO BE PART OF HIS GAME.
THEY SAY THAT THAT HELPS WHEN THERE ARE QUESTIONS ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
DO YOU BUY IT OR DO THEY NEED TO BE BETTER UP FRONT?
NO THEY NEED TO BE BETTER UP FRONT.
IM A BIG BELIEVER FOOTBALL ISNT COMPLICATED.
YOU GOT TO BLOCK YOU GOT TO TACKLE CATCH AND ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.
WHAT WE SAW FROM THE ARIZONA CARDINALS LAST YEAR THEY COULDNT BLOCK THEIR WAY OUT OF A WET PAPER BAG.
THIS IS GOING TO BE THIS IS A SITUATION THAT BEARS WATCHING AS FAR AS KYLER MURRAY AND PROTECTING MOVING FORWARD.
BY THE WAY WE HEARD THE SAME SPIEL WHEN I WAS TRYING TO SIGN DAMIAN WOODY.
HE REMINDED US HOW IMPORTANT THE OFFENSIVE LINE IS.
YEAH.
LISTEN THE TAPE DONT LIE.
TAPE DOESNT LIE.
I LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF DAMIAN.
THATS RIGHT.
WE GOT MORE DO THOUGH.
COMING UP ON NFL LIVE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER INDEPENDENCE DAY IS TOMORROW.
WERE NOT ON THE AIR TOMORROW.
WERE GOING TO CELEBRATE A DAY EARLY WITH THE NFLS MOST INDEPENDENT PLAYS.
LOOKING AT THE GUYS WHO CAN DO IT ALL BY THEMSELVES.
SPEAKING OF DOING IT ALL CAM NEWTON MAY BE REHABBING HIS THROWING ARM BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN HE CANT CATCH.
WHICH QUARTERBACK HAS THE BEST HANDS?
DAMIAN WOODY IS GOING TO TAKE A SHOT AT RANKING THOSE.
JALEN RAMSEY HAS HE CHANGED HIS WAYS?
WELL BRING HIM IN LIVE.
HELL TELL US.
I GO OUT THERE WITH A LITTLE FLAG.
SOMETIMES I GO OUT THERE AND LET THE RECEIVER KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG GAME YOURE TRASH COMPARED TO ME.
I got a very very small loan from my father.
You gotta start somewhere.
Im a reporter for The New York Times.
The when the where bank statements tax returns its out dozens of copy records of deeds and reports.
1995 showed that he was bleeding money.
Go through it all understand it all Holy sh Number by number brick by brick.
Thats when we realized.
Thats fraud.
I built this empire and I did it by myself.
New for summer its Bud Light Lemon Tea.
Thats fraud.
Brewed with REAL lemon peels and aged on REAL tea leaves.
Yes its real.
No youre not dreaming.
Hey dont do that.
i Pieces or Cups?i i Piecesi ini Cups!i i Man were killingi i it over here huh?i i Not sorry.
Reeses.i In every trip theres room for more than just the business i itiyou came for.iuh?i Whether thats taking in every moment or capturing a moment worth bringing back.
Thats room for possibility.
sprinklers label tearing bottle opens Yay!
aahhh label tearing bottle opens aahhh label tearing bottle opens aahhh I switched to MiraLAX for my constipation.
i Stimulant laxativesi i forcefully stimulatei i the nerves in your colon.i i MiraLAX works withi i the water in youri i body to unblock youri i system naturally.i i And it doesnt causei i bloatingi icramping gasi ior sudden urgency.i i MiraLAX.i i Look for the pink cap.i So I can buy from Enterprise Car Sales and youll take ANY tradein?
Thats right!
Great!
Here you go... Well it does need to be a vehicle.
But I need this out of my house.
VO With fair transparent value for every tradein... Enterprise makes it easy.
Announcer NFL LIVE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PIZZA HUT.
NO ONE OUTPIZZAS THE HUT.
ITS SOMETHING THAT MY MOM WARNS ME ABOUT.
YOU ONLY GET ONE SET OF TEETH.
FROM EAR TO EAR HES ALWAYS SMILING.
HES ALWAYS KIDDING AROUND AND KEEPING IT LIGHT.
IF IM FEELING GOOD I KNOW THAT ITS GOING TO BE CONTAGIOUS ENOUGH AROUND OTHERS.
CAM NEWTON IS SMILING BECAUSE HES AWESOME.
HE CAN RUN AND THROW AND APPARENTLY HE CAN CATCH.
RECENTLY SHOWING UP ONE HAND BEHIND HIS BACK.
ODELL BECKHAM HAS NOTHING ON CAM.
SO I KNOW DAMIAN ALWAYS SAYS WE DONT GIVE QUARTERBACKS ENOUGH ATTENTION AROUND HERE.
QUARTERBACK CATCHES OF ALLTIME.
THIS MOHAMED SANU CATCH.
LOOK AT THE REST OF THE WAY TO THE END ZONE.
THE SWEET DIVE TO THE PYLON.
MOST PLACES.
ANDREW LUCK IN COLLEGE.
HE HAD A COUPLE TARGETS LAST SEASON.
LOOK AT THIS ONEHANDED CATCH HE MADE AT STANFORD.
LOOK AT THAT FOOT INBOUNDS.
NOT A CATCH IN THE NFL.
GOT TO DRAG IT.
THESE ARE GREAT ATHLETES.
THATS PRETTY CLEAR THERE.
BUT I DONT THINK THEYRE GOING TO HAVE TOO MUCH OF THAT.
HOW COULD WE FORGET.
QUARTERBACK SUPER BOWL HISTORY NICK FOLES IS ACTING JOB MIECHB MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE CATCH ITSELF.
WHAT A MOMENT.
ALLTIME MOMENT IN NFL AROUND CERTAINLY EAGLES HISTORY.
OBVIOUSLY QUARTERBACKS ARE ALLAROUND ATHLETES TOO IN SOME CASES.
I KNOW I KNOW.
IT HURT YOU.
IT HURTS TO GIVE THIS MUCH PRAISE TO QUARTERBACKS.
HERE WE ARE.
JULY 3rd.
WERE GOING TO DO IT.
GRIND OUT THIS CONTENT.
DAMIAN I WANT YOUR LIST OF THE MOST VERSATILE QUARTERBACKS CURRENTLY PLAYING IN THE NFL.
NUMBER 5 WERE GOING TO START WITH THIS BIG GUY RIGHT HERE.
JOSH ALLEN.
THE THING I LIKE TALKING ABOUT HIS CANNON ARM.
I DIDNT KNOW HE WAS AN OLYMPIC HURDLER AS WELL.
JUMPING OVER THE MINNESOTA VIKING DEFENDER THERE.
THAT WAS A HUGE PLAY IN THAT BUFFALO BILLS WIN UP IN MINNESOTA LAST YEAR.
SO THIS DUDE IS A TREMENDOUS ATHLETE.
LOOK FOR HIM TO HAVE A BIG YEAR THIS YEAR.
HE LED THE BILLS RUSHING.
THATS RIGHT.
EVERYTHING THAT DAMIAN SAID HES BIG STRONG CAN MAKE ALL THE THROWS.
HES GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO CORRAL THAT IN SO HE CAN PLAY A FULL SEASON.
HES GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF HITS.
YOU MEAN PLAY QUARTERBACK.
NUMBER 4 RIGHT HERE.
WERE GOING TO GO WITH MITCHELL TRUBISKY.
I ALWAYS WANT TO CALL MITCHELL VICK.
HE LOOKS LIKE GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE THIS PLAY HERE AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS YOU WATCH THIS GUY RUN HES A REALLY GOOD ATHLETE HE CAN RUN WITH THE FOOTBALL IN HIS HANDS.
DANGEROUS IN RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AGAIN.
HE TAKES OFF IN THE POCKET.
HES PULLING AWAY FROM PEOPLE HERE.
SO LISTEN THE DEFENSE GOT TO DEFEND BOTH OF THE ASPECTS OF THE QUARTERBACK MAKES IT AWFULLY HUFF.
THE OFFENSIVE PLAY TO HIS STRENGTH.
A LOT THE ANDY REID CONCEPT.
THATS A HARD OFFENSE TO DEFEND.
NUMBER 3.
I CAN DO BOTH.
GOT BIG BEN HERE.
WE ALL KNOW BIG BEN IS A FUTURE HALL OF FAMER.
HOW MUCH THIS PLAYING SITUATIONAL FOOTBALL.
WE TALK ABOUT SITUATIONAL FOOTBALL DOWNED THE BALL INSIDE THE 1 YARD LINE.
HUGE PLAY AGAIN.
BIG BEN SHOWING OFF WITH ANOTHER BOOT PUNT.
SETTING IT UP RIGHT HERE.
SETTING UP WITH THE SPECIAL TEAMS.
NOT ONLY GO OUT THERE SET YOUR FIELD POSITION UP.
GET PAID.
HE MUST ENJOY THAT.
BE LOVING IT.
SO NUMBER TWO WE GOT KILLER CAM.
CAM NEWTON RIGHT HERE.
LISTEN CAM NEWTON IS A FREAK OF NATURE.
YOURE GOING TO SEE RIGHT HERE LITTLE TRICK.
BOOM.
DROP THE HAMMER DOWN ON THE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.
HOW MANY QUARTERBACKS ARE WILLING TO THROW THEIR SHOULDER IN ON A DEFENSIVE LINEMAN AND KNOCK HIM DOWN TO THE GROUND.
CAM IS A BIG BOY.
SO IT REALLY DOESNT SURPRISE ME THAT HES KNOCKED THAT DEFENSIVE LINEMAN ON HIS BUTT.
AGAIN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN CAN APPRECIATE A QUARTERBACK.
ONE THATS BODYING FOR THE PLAY.
HES PHYSICALLY IMPOSING.
WHEN YOU SEE HIM COME OUT FROM WARMUPS HES A PHYSICALLY IMPOSING PLAYER THAT HAPPENS TO BE A QUARTERBACK.
THATS RIGHT.
QUARTERBACK SEGMENT WITHOUT YOU TALKING ABOUT BLOCKING.
UNBELIEVABLE.
GOT TO HAVE  THIS GUY.
THIS RIGHT HERE HALL OF FAMER RIGHT HERE PATRICK MAHOMES.
WE TALK ABOUT HIM AS A AS A FATHER YOU TALK ABOUT HAVING YOUR KIDS INVOLVED IN MORE THAN ONE SPORT.
HERES WHY.
YOU TAKE A GUY IN PATRICK MAHOMES GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER ALSO A GREAT BASEBALL PLAYER.
YOU SEE HIM THROWING FROM ALL DIFFERENT ARM ANGLES BEING ABLE TO MAKE PLAYS.
THROWING WITH HIS LEFT HAND.
HE DID THIS TIME AFTER TIME AGAIN DURING THE SEASON.
THAT MADE HIM SPECIAL.
NOLOOK PASSES.
TO ME THATS A PART OF A PLAN.
MULTIPLE SPORTS THEY KIND OF INTERTWINE WITH EACH OTHER.
THERES A BIG REASON WHY HE WAS NFL MVP LAST YEAR.
MIKE WHEN YOURE EVALUATING QUARTERBACKS HOW MUCH DOES IT FACTOR IN HOW ATHLETIC THEY ARE AND THEY CAN DO THIS STUFF?
BEING ABLE TO BUY A SECOND CHANCE WE TALKED ABOUT KYLER MURRAY BEHIND THE OFFENSIVE LINE THE FACT THAT HELL BE ABLE TO AVOID MOVE UP IN THE POCKET SOMETIMES ITS NOT ABOUT YARDS BUT AVOIDING THE BIG HIT EXTENDING THE PLAY.
KEEPING YOUR EYES DOWN THE FIELD.
ITS REALLY IMPORTANT.
ITS A SKILL THAT TRANSFERS FROM COLLEGE TO PROS.
YOU GUYS TRIVIA TIME.
DO YOU KNOW WHICH ACTIVE NFL QUARTERBACK HAS THE MOST CAREER CATCHES?
THEY DONT KNOW.
NO.
DREW BREES.
HE HAS EIGHT.
WOW.
HOW ABOUT THAT.
REALLY?
WELL RUN THEM BACK.
WELL HAVE TO SEE THAT.
LATER IN THE SUMMER WELL DO DREW BREES HIGHLIGHTS.
WE NEED THE CONTENT.
JALEN RAMSEY HAS NOT BEEN SHY ABOUT SHARING HIS OPINION ON THINGS LIKE QUARTERBACK RANKINGS.
NOW HES GOT A SUPER BOWL MVP LEADING HIS OFFENSE.
DOES JALEN THINK Remember that degree you got in taxation?
Of course you dont because you didnt!
Your job isnt understanding tax code... its understanding why that... will get him a body like that... MOVE!
...that.
Your job isnt doing hard work...
Here.
...its making her do hard work... ...and getting paid for it.
Snap and sort your expenses to save over 4600 at tax time.

IF YOU DREAM ABOUT CATCHING THIS BALL ON ME YOU BETTER WAKE UP AND APOLOGIZE.
I GO OUT WITH A LITTLE SWAG.
PUKD OFF BY JALEN RAMSEY.
RAMSEY CAME OVER THE TOP.
YOU GO OUT THERE AND I LET THE RECEIVER KNOW EVERY PLAY HEY THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG GAME FOR YOU.
I CALL THE OUT THEIR ROUTES TO LET THEM KNOW.
YOURE TRASH.
PLEASE WELCOME INTO NFL LIVE.
JAGUARS QUARTERBACK JALEN RAMSEY WHO JOINS US TODAY FROM LONDON ENGLAND.
JALEN I GOT TO START HERE.
I WAS DISMAYED WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF EVALUATING QUARTERBACKS.
YOU WERE SO GOOD AT IT.
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO STOP?
REALLY I WENT THROUGH MOST OF THEM LAST YEAR.
TO BE HONEST I DIDNT THINK I NEEDED TO DO IT AGAIN.
MY OPINIONS DIDNT SAY TOO MUCH.
SO YEAH.
I JUST DIDNT FEEL THE NEED TO DO IT AGAIN.
I WANTED TO PUMP UP NICK A LITTLE BIT.
I WAS EXCITED TO SEE NICK OUT THERE.
I WANTED TO PUMP NICK UP A LITTLE BIT.
YEAH GOT AWAY FROM IT FOR A LITTLE BIT.
ILL STILL TALK MY TRASH THOUGH.
AS YOU WENT AROUND THE LEAGUE DID YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW YOU GAVE WHERE YOU TALKED ABOUT ALL THE QUARTERBACKS PEOPLE GIVE YOU A HARD TIME OR TELL YOU YOU WERE RIGHT?
YEAH.
I MEAN IT WAS OPINIONBASED.
YOU KNOW WE WERE EXACTLY HOW IT WENT.
WE WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT.
WE STARTED OFF NAMING LIKE WHO WERE THE TOP FIVE QUARTERBACKS AND GOING DOWN THE LIST.
I WAS KIND OF STILL KEEPING THE TIME FRAME HES NOT TOP FIVE.
HES OVERRATED.
HES GOOD WHATEVER.
WHATEVER I WAS SAYING ABOUT EACH AND EVERY QUARTERBACK YEAH GIVING SOME OPINIONS.
SOME PEOPLE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEYRE GOING TO AGREE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO AGREE.
EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINION.
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU MENTIONED YOUR NEW QUARTERBACK NICK FOLES JOINING THE JAGUARS AS A FREE AGENT THIS YEAR.
WHATS THE ONE THING ABOUT HIM THAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN BEFORE HE WAS YOUR TEAMMATE?
I MEAN HES JUST HOW WELL HE PRACTICES I GUESS.
I OF COURSE NEVER PRACTICED WITH HIM.
AT MINICAMP I SAW HOW HE COMES OUT AND WORKS HARD AND PUSHES THE GUYS AND LEADS THE OFFENSE.
IT WAS TRULY IMPRESSIVE.
I HAD KNOWN AND HEARD ABOUT HOW GOOD OF A TEAMMATE HE WAS AND HOW GOOD OF A PERSON HE WAS IN GENERAL.
BUT JUST SEEING HIM IN THE LOCKER ROOM BEING IN HIS PRESENCE AND COMMUNICATING WITH HIM AND OUR FEW INTERACTIONS IT WAS SUPER NICE.
STARTING QUARTERBACK IS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR CHANGE ON ANY NFL TEAM.
WHATS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE JAGUARS THIS YEAR VERSUS LAST YEAR HAVING MADE THAT CHANGE?
I FEEL LIKE ITS UPGRADE.
OF COURSE I WAS SAYING BLAKE WAS A REALLY GOOD TEAMMATE TO EVERYBODY.
HAVING NICK AND A FORMER SUPER BOWL CHAMPION AND SUPER BOWL MVP WE HAVE SUPREME CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND WE THINK THAT HES GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB OF LEADING OUR OFFENSE.
OF COURSE ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL WE ARE OVERFLOWING WITH CONFIDENCE OVER THERE AND SAYING WHO WE THINK CAN GET THE JOB DONE OVER THERE ON THAT SIDE.
NOW WE GOT SOMEBODY ELSE TO ROLL WITH THE OTHER GUYS OVER THERE.
WERE SUPER EXCITED.
THE DEFENSE OBVIOUSLY COMPLETELY DOMINANT TWO SEASONS AGO.
YOU KWAME AGONIZINGLY CLOSE TO THE SUPER BOWL AND LAST YEAR DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE TEAM ALL THE WAY AROUND.
WHAT GIVES YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS CAN BE CLOSER TO 2017 THAN 2018?
WERE GOING TO BREAK THE JOURNEY TO BE HONEST.
YOU KNOW JOURNEY PEOPLE SAY TRUST THE PROCESS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
I REALLY DONT EVEN BELIEVE IN THAT.
WE CAN MAKE HOWEVER MANY PLANS WE WANT TO IN OUR HEADS AND WHATEVER WE FEEL THE PROCESS IS.
ITS TRULY GOING TO BE A JOURNEY.
ITS GOING TO BE UPS AND DOWNS HIGHS AND LOWS.
WE HAVE TO ROLL WITH ALL OF THEM.
WE HAVE TO ROLL WITH THE HIGHS AND THE LOWS.
WE HAVE TO PUSH THROUGH AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN POSITION TO WIN THE DIVISION WIN THE CONFERENCE AND GO TO THE SUPER BOWL AND COMPETE FOR THE SUPER BOWL.
YOUVE QUICKLY ESTABLISHED YOURSELF AS ONE OF THE BETTER PLAYERS AT YOUR POSITION IN THE LEAGUE.
BUT THE NFL BEING WHAT IT IS YOURE STILL A WAYS AWAY FROM FREE AGENCY.
THE JAGUARS PICKED UP YOUR CONTRACT OPTION FOR 2020.
ANY EXTENSION TALKS YET OR IS THAT STILL ON THE BACK BURNER?
ITS ON THE BACK BURNER RIGHT NOW.
BUT THATS COMPLETELY FINE.
FIRST ROUND CONTRACTS OUR STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW.
THE TEAMS HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE.
THEY CAN PICK UP THE FIFTHYEAR OPTION.
YOU KNOW UNLIKE OTHER GUYS WHO OUTPLAY THEIR ROOKIE CONTRACT AND CAN REUP RIGHT NOW AND GET BASICALLY WHAT THEYRE WORTH FIRST ROUNDERS DONT HAVE THAT LUXURY.
WE HAVE THE FIFTH YEAR OPTION AND AFTER THAT THEY CAN FRANCHISE TAG AND DO EVERY THING THEY WANT TO DO.
THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LEVERAGE.
IM GOING TO LET MY AGENT HANDLE A LOT OF THAT.
IM GOING TO FOCUS ON WHAT I CAN AND PLAY BALL.
HELP THE TEAM WIN WHILE IM HERE IN JACKSONVILLE.
HOPEFULLY IM HERE FOR A LONG TIME.
ITS TIME TO OPEN UP CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS.
WELL SEE HOW THINGS GO.
OF COURSE WE WANTED TO GET IT DONE THIS YEAR.
BUT IT WONT GET DONE THIS YEAR.
HEY IT IS WHAT IT IS.
WE TALKED WITH THE JAGUARS AND EVERYBODY WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THAT.
THEY KNOW WHATS UP.
 YOURE COMING TO US FROM LONDON TODAY.
A BIG STORY IN THE STATES IS THE U.S. WOMENS SOCCER TEAM BEATING ENGLAND IN THE WORLD CUP YESTERDAY.
WHATS CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IS ALEX MORGAN  WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT AS A KNOWN TRASH TALKER?
I LOVED IT OF COURSE.
LIKE YOU SAID IVE BEEN KNOWN TO TRASH TALK MYSELF AND DO EYE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.
I LOVED IT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FITTING OF COURSE.
BECAUSE OF WHO THEY PLAYED OBVIOUSLY.
I MEAN SERVING IT UP WHY NOT?
HAVE SOME FUN.
YOU KNOW WERE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES OF COURSE BUT WERE ALSO ENTERTAINERS IN A SENSE.
WE WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING INTERESTING.
SO NOW SHE GAVE PEOPLE EVERYTHING TO TALK ABOUT A LOT ABOUT.
I THINK ITS COOL.
GOOD.
JALEN RAMSEY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US ON NFL LIVE AND SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS.
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU IN COMING SEASON.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
ALL RIGHT.
BACK TO OUR DECLARATIONS.
IF YOU WERENT HERE EARLIER TOMORROW IS THE FOURTH OF JULY AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
NFL DECLARATIONS HERE ON NFL LIVE.
DAMIAN MADE A DECLARATION EARLIER ABOUT KIRK COUSINS.
HE WAS VERY VOCIFEROUS.
MIKE YOU GOT ONE ON THE JAGUARS?
I ABSOLUTELY DO.
I DECLARE THAT NICK FOLES WILL LEAD THE JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS TO THE SUPER BOWL REPRESENTING THE AFC.
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOURE A STUDENT OF THE GAME.
LAST YEAR THE JAGUARS AVERAGED LESS THAN 10 POINTS A GAME AND YOU TAKE WHAT IS ALREADY A CHAMPIONSHIP LEVEL DEFENSE LED BY JALEN RAMSEY AND THIS YEARS FIRST ROUND PICK JOSH ALLEN WITH A QUARTERBACK WHO TWO YEARS AGO BUT FOR A DROP IN THE NFC PLAYOFFS BROUGHT THE EAGLES TO TWO CONSECUTIVE SUPER BOWLS.
THATS MY DECLARATION.
THIS IS INTERESTING.
JALEN RAMSEY HAS IN FACT STAYED ON THE LINE AND HEARD YOUR DK DECLARATION MIKE TANNENBAUM.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?
I LOVE THAT DECLARATION RIGHT THERE.
SPEAKING OF I LOVE IT.
IM SUPER EXCITED TO HAVE NICK ON THE TEAM.
WERE GOING TO PUT ALL THAT CONFIDENCE BEHIND HIM AND LET HIM LEAD THE OFFENSE.
LIKE YOU SAID THIS DEFENSE WE HAVE WE THINK SOME BIG THINGS COULD BE IN STORE FOR THE 2019 SEASON.
JALEN WHEN EVERYBODY IS ON THE BANDWAGON REMEMBER WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION ON JULY 3rd.
THAT WAS MY DECLARATION.
IM WITH YOU GUYS.
THE BANDWAGON STARTS TODAY.
LET NOT LET ANYBODY ELSE ON.
I APPRECIATE YOU STICKING AROUND.
LOVE IT.
DECLARATION WE SHOULD HAVE JALEN IN AND DO THE  YOU JUST GO ALL IN.
IN ON MY HEAD ABOUT KIRK COUSINS.
YOURE ALL IN ON JACKSONVILLE.
LISTEN NICK FOLES WAS GREAT WITH DOUG PEDERSON.
I FELT THEY HAD A CHEMISTRY.
YOU THINK THEY CAN CREATE THAT IN JACKSONVILLE WITH THIS DIFFERENT CAST OF CHARACTERS?
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
IT STARTS WITH THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD OFFENSIVE LINE.
DOUG MARRONE WAS AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN PLAYED COACHED IT.
NOW HES THEIR HEAD COACH.
IT ALLOWS THEM TO TRAVEL PLAY WELL ON THE ROAD AND WITH THAT DEFENSE THEYRE LOADED UP FRONT.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF DEPTH AT PASS RUSHER WHEN YOU LOOK AT LAST YEARS FIRST ROUND PICK.
NOKE WAY.
AT DEFENSIVE END AND CALAIS CAMPBELL AND JOSH ALLEN THIS YEAR.
THEY HAVE DEPTH UP FRONT AND TWO CORNERS IN RAMSEY.
BLAKE BORTLES.
WERE BEING GENEROUS WITH THAT.
NICK FOLES WAS A GOOD QUARTERBACK.
THATS MY DECLARATION.
ONE DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE THE REASON THEY SIGN THEM 23 INTERCEPTIONS IN 40 GAMES IN PHILADELPHIA.
BORTLES HAD 58 INTERCEPTIONS IN 60 GAMES.
THEY SHOULD BE BETTER THERE.
WERE GOING TO HAVE MORE DECLARATIONS LATER IN THE SHOW.
WERE GOING TO TALK TO SOCCER.
ALEX MORGAN SHOOK UP THE TWITTER VERSE WITH HER TEA SIPPING  WHAT COMPARES TO THIS SURPRISINGLY CONTROVERSIAL ONE.
STAY TUNED TO NFL LIVE.
WELL TALK ABOUT IT.

NOT GREAT CHANGE OF DIRECTION.
THATS WHY THEYRE FIVE FOR ME.
GOT THEM TO THE SUPER BOWL.
NUMBER 4 THE ATLANTA FALCONS.
YOU LOOK AT MATT RYAN SUPER BOWL QUARTERBACK JULIO JONES ARGUABLY THE BEST RECEIVER IN THE NFL AND THEN OBVIOUSLY FREEMAN OFF THE INJURY.
HES A GOOD RUNNING BACK.
I THINK THATS A REALLY SOLID THREE GUYS RIGHT THERE.
RUNNING BACKS COMING OFF INJURIES.
THEY CAN REST ON THOSE TOO TWO GUYS.
DRAFTED A COUPLE LINEMEN UP FRONT.
THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR MATT RYAN AND DeVONTE FREEMAN.
BIG THREE OFFENSIVE LINE.
NUMBER 3 THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THIS.
DAK PRESCOTT 3216 AS A STARTING.
ZEKE ELLIOTT A RUNNING BACK AS THERE IS IN THE LEAGUE AMARI COOPER ALL THEY DID WAS GO 72 AFTER THE TRADE AND THEY WERE NUMBER ONE OVER THE LAST NINE GAMES ON THIRD DOWN.
NUMBER 2 WHAT DO YOU GOT?
THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS LED BY FUTURE HALL OF FAMER DREW BREES AT QUARTERBACK.
MICHAEL THOMAS WHO IS NOT BAD.
JULIO JONES NOT FAR BEHIND.
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM HES A GREAT RUNNING BACK AND OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
WHO COULD BE BETTER THAN THAT?
LETS ONE OF YOUR FORMER TEAMS.
THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN TO THE  TOM BRADY BEST QUARTERBACK OF ALLTIME JULIAN EDELMAN I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FROM HIM.
HES WILLED HIMSELF INTO A GREAT PLAYER.
SONY MICHEL ISNT A GREAT PLAYER HE WAS A FIRST ROUND PICK.
GOT BETTER AS THE YEAR WENT ON.
HES GOING TO TURN INTO BEING A GOOD NFL RUNNING BACK.
TOM BRADY IT STARTS WITH HIM.
YOU KNOW I AM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW WHY?
I DONT KNOW WHY YOU DONT BELIEVE IN KIRK COUSINS.
THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST DUO IN THE LEAGUE IN ADAM AND STEPHAN DIGS.
WHAT IS UP WITH THE HATE AGAINST THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS?
YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN TO THE PURPLE PEOPLE EATERS OUT THERE.
I WATCHED THE TAPE THATS I CANT.
WHOA.
THAT IS A GOOD GROUP.
ITS NOT LIKE OBVIOUSLY KANSAS CITY.
THESE ARE ALL GOOD.
YOURE TALKING ABOUT HALL OF FAME QUARTERBACK TOM BRADY.
HALL OF FAME QUARTERBACK IN DREW BREES.
MATT RYAN HAS A HALL OF FAME CREDENTIALS POSSIBLY AND I THINK THATS A REALLY HIGH LEVEL.
NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF OVER HERE.
DO YOU THINK THAT IF DALVIN COOK IS A HEALTHY RUNNING BACK HE COULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT THEM IN THIS CATEGORY.
I THINK DALVIN COOK IS A GAME CHANGER.
KIRK COUSINS IS A GOOD RUNNING GAME.
PLAY ACTION.
DALVIN COOK HOPEFULLY NOT ONLY HELPS THE RUNNING GAME BUT THEIR PASSING GAME.
THOSE ARE THE BIG THREES.
STILL NOTHING ON KAWHI.
WELL LET YOU KNOW IF WE SEE ANYTHING.
WERE GOING TO TALK TO TIGHTI HAD NJOKU ABOUT ALL New for summer.
Here for summer.
Arriving...this summer.
Its Bud Light Lemon Tea.
New for summer.
Ive been waiting my whole life for this.
You ready?
Are you?
Woo.
Look!
Make a wish!
I wish for a Biggie Bag from Wendys.
everyone loved each other and was always... Thats a great wish Jimmy.
Get a Bacon Double stack with a quarter pound of fresh beef nuggets fries and a drink for just five bucks.
Wendys Biggie Bag is everything you could wish for.
BREAKING NEWS INTO NFNFL LIVE.
COWBOYS RUNNING BABACK EZEKIEL ELLIOTT HAS BEEN INFORMED HE WILL NOT BE SUSPENDED FOR HIS ROLE IN THAT RECENT ALTERCATION IN LAS VEGAS WITH THE SECURITY GUARD THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW.
ELLIOTT MET WITH COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL YESTERDAY AND ISSUED A STATEMENT LAST NIGHT ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT THERE APOLOGIZING AND WE ARE NOW BEING INFORMED THAT HE WILL NOT FACE ANOTHER SUSPENSION.
SO OBVIOUSLY A RELIEF FOR EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND FOR THE COWBOYS THERE.
ABSOLUTELY.
LISTEN AS A VETERAN IN THE LOCKER ROOM THIS IS EXACTLY THE OUTCOME YOU WANTED.
YOU WANT ALL YOUR GUYS ALL HANDS ON DECK TO BE AVAILABLE.
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT YEAR FOR EVERYONE WITHIN THE DALLAS COWBOYS ORGANIZATION FROM THE HEAD COACH ON DOWN.
OBVIOUSLY MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT PLAYER FOR THE TEAM IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AT THE START OF THE SEASON.
ARE YOU SURPRISED MIKE?
I WAS MILDLY SURPRISED.
AGAIN THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICYS STANDARD IS LOWER THAN CRIMINAL CONDUCT.
THE COMMISSIONER COULD HAVE SUSPENDED HIM BECAUSE HES A REPEAT OFFENDER AND THE FACT THAT HE BROUGHT HIM TO NEW YORK CITY SHOWS IT WAS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH FOR A FACETOFACE MEETING.
LOOK AT THE END OF THE DAY HOPEFULLY EZEKIEL ELLIOTT HAS LEARNED AND ALL THESE SORT OF BUMPS IN THE ROAD FROM OFF THE FIELD ARE IN HIS PAST BECAUSE HE IS A GREAT PLAYER AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS A GOOD TEAMMATE AS WELL.
HOPEFULLY HES LEARNED FROM THIS AND MOVED ON.
WE TALKED EARLIER IN THE SHOW ABOUT THE KIND OF CONVERSATION YOU HAVE WITH A PLAYER IN THIS SITUATION IF YOURE IN THE FRONT OFFICE.
DOES THE FACT THAT HE ISNT BEING SUSPENDED CHANGE ANY PART OF THAT MESSAGE OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DELIVER?
NO.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STERN DIRECT AND HARD CONVERSATION THAT YOUR BEHAVIOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF SUSPENSION ITS STILL NOT CONDUCT BECOMING OF A DALLAS COWBOY.
AGAIN IF I WAS IN THE FRONT OFFICE MAKING THE DECISION I WOULD HIT PAUSE ON THE CONTRACT EXTENSION AND I WOULD PUT MY EFFORTS AND ENERGY INTO THE GOOD PLAYERS AND THE PLAYERS THAT HAVE HANDLED THEMSELVES THE RIGHT WAY OFF THE FIELD STARTING WITH THE QUARTERBACK DAK PRESCOTT AND THEIR RECEIVER AMARI COOPER.
HOPEFULLY ITS A LESSON LEARNED FOR ZEKE ELLIOTT IT DOESNT HAPPEN AGAIN.
IF IM THE DALLAS COWBOYS I HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT WERE THINKING AND WHY WERE THINKING IT.
DAMIAN?
AGAIN AS A PLAYER IN THE LOCKER ROOM THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.
HES GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AND WE CAN GO OUT AND WIN FOOTBALL GAMES.
I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING TO THE IDEA HES NOT BEING SPEBDED SO YOU STILL HAVE TO SORT OF MAKE SURE SOMETHING IT LEARNED FROM THIS RIGHT AS A PLAYER?
THERES SOMETHING FOR THE DALLAS COWBOYS INTERNALLY FOR THE ORGANIZATION THEY WANT TO DO.
FOR A VETERAN DONT MESS WITH MY MONEY.
THATS MY BIGGEST THING.
WHEN YOURE NOT THERE YOU AFFECT MY PLAY.
SO STAY ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW SO WE CAN WIN FOOTBALL GAMES.
NOT THIS NECESSARILY HAPPENED TO YOU BUT BEING CALLED INTO THE COMMISSIONERS OFFICE EVEN WITH NO SUSPENSION SHOULD THAT  IT SHOULD BE.
SCARED STRAIGHT.
YOU GOT TO TALK TO BIG BAD ROGER GOODELL MAKE SURE IM ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.
HOPEFULLY EZEKIEL HAS LEARNED FROM THIS AND THE COWBOYS CAN MOVE FORWARD NOW.
THATS THE PART THAT THERES A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE NFL COMMUNITY THAT ARE SURPRISED.
THATS WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO THE LAST TIME GOT SUSPENDED HAD TO GO TO THE LEAGUE OFFICE.
YOU WOULD THINK WITH THE CONTRACT ON THE HORIZON HE WOULD TRY TO BE IMPECCABLE.
HOPEFULLY HES LEARNED FROM IT AND CAN MOVE ON.
OBVIOUSLY THIS CLEARS THE DECK IN TERMS OF A MAJOR CONCERN.
THEY HAVE CONTRACT SITUATION TOSS WORK THROUGH HEADING INTO CAMP.
YOU SEE THEM PRIEPD FOR A REAL SERIES RUN?
I THINK THE DALLAS COWBOYS CAN REPRESENT IN THE SUPER BOWL.
THE WAY THAT DAK PRESCOTT PLAYED AFTER THE TRADE OF AMARI COOPER FROM OAKLAND THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
ACROSS THE BOARD.
COMPLETION PERCENTAGE YARDS PER ATTEMPT.
THIRD DOWN.
ALL THOSE NUMBERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER WITH AMARI COOPER.
YOU KNOW DURING THE TRADE SEASON SO IMAGINE NOW IN THE OFFSEASON YOU GOT A NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN KELLEN MOORE.
WE DONT KNOW HOW THATS GOING TO WORK OUT BUT YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD ACCENTUATE ALL PARTS OF DAKS GAME.
THIS OFFENSE THIS TEAM IN GENERAL TO ME IS ONE OF THE BETTER TEAMS IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
ONLY THREE TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE WON MORE GAMES THAN THE COWBOYS THE LAST THREE YEARS.
THE CHIEFS THE PATRIOTS AND THE STEELERS.
THATS PRETTY GOOD COMPANY.
AGAIN I DONT THINK DAK PRESCOTT GETS ENOUGH CREDIT.
HES 3216 AS A STARTER.
THE ULTIMATE MEASURE OF A QUARTERBACK IS HIS ONE LOSS RECORD.
YOU GO BACK TO THE LAST YEAR PASSER RATING OF 122 ON PLAY ACTION PLAYS.
IT SHOWS YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF EZEKIEL ELLIOTTS AVAILABILITY AS YOU MENTIONED DAMIAN.
DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH OF CARSON WENTZ DALLAS HAS A REASONABLE CHANCE OF WINNING THIS DIVISION.
OVERS LAST COUPLE YEARS PHILADELPHIA HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF HAVING BEEN BEHIND WENTZ.
FOLES ISNT THERE.
WENTZ HAS TO OVERKONL THAT ISSUE.
CAN HE STAY HEALTHY FOR 16 GAMES.
YOU LOOK AT THE WAY DALLAS HAS BUILT ITS TEAM ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL.
THE NFL RELEASED A STATEMENT ON THIS ISSUE REGARDING EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
ANNOUNCING THAT HE WONT BE SUSPENDED.
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REPORTS OF AN INCIDENT IN LAS VEGAS IN MAY THE NFL CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION THAT INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH MULTIPLE WITNESSES INCLUDING SECURITY PERSONNEL AND OTHERS WITH DIRECT INVOLVEMENT.
AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF DOCUMENTARY AND OTHER INFORMATION.
ON TUESDAY AS PART OF THE REVIEW NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL MET WITH MR. ELLIOTT TO REINFORCE THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT EXPECTED OF HIM AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS.
MR. ELLIOTT ACKNOWLEDGED HE DEMONSTRATED POOR JUDGMENT AND COMMITTED TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES IN THE FUTURE.
HE VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HIM TO HELP HIM TO GROW PERSONALLY.
COMMISSIONER GOODELL DETERMINED THERE WAS NO VIOLATION OF THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY AND NO FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED.
SO STATEMENT CONFIRMING WHAT WE WERE TOLD.
ANY QUICK REACTIONS THERE?
GOT LUCKY.
HE GOT LUCKY.
HE COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN SUSPENDED AGAIN.
MIKE YOU HAD TOUCHED UPON IT PRIOR.
USUALLY IN THESE SITUATIONS YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR SECOND TIME GOING TO NEW YORK AND TALKING TO THE COMMISSIONER.
YOUVE BEEN SUSPENDED BEFORE ALREADY.
YOU GET OFF WITH NO PUNISHMENT.
HES VERY FORTUNATE TO BE IN THIS SITUATION.
THEY TOUCHED ON IT IN A LETTER THERE THAT LEAGUE AND THE UNION DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PLAYERS TO COACHES TO STAFF IN TERMS OF IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED HELP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES BEHIND THE SCENES.
HOPEFULLY IF HE NEEDS THAT HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF IT AND I KNOW THEY MENTIONED THAT IN A LETTER.
THATS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.
THEY ARE TRYING TO HELP PLAYERS.
ONCE AGAIN THE NEWS ON COWBOYS RUNNING BACK EZEKIEL ELLIOTT NO PUNISHMENT NO SUSPENSION AS A RESULT OF HIS MOST RECENT INCIDENT.

RECAPPING OURUR BREAKINING TODAY ON NFL LIVE.
COWBOYS RUNNING BACK EZEKIEL ELLIOTT WILL NOT FACE PUNISHMENT FOR HIS ROLE IN A RECENT INCIDENT WITH A SECURITY GUARD IN LAS VEGAS.
ELLIOTT MET WITH COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS TUESDAY THIS WEEK AND WAS INFORMED HE WOULD NOT BE SUSPENDED.
THE NFL RELEASED A STATEMENT EXPLAINING IT BASICALLY SAYS THEY FOUND HE DID NOT VIOLATE THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY BUT THEY HOPE THAT HE CONTINUES TO STAY OUT OF THESE SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE.
DAMIAN YOUR THOUGHTS?
WELL I MEAN MY BIGGEST THING IS DOES ZEKE GROW FROM HERE?
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME GOING TO NEW YORK.
THE FIRST TIME I BELIEVE IT WAS A SIXGAME SUSPENSION.
THIS TIME HE GOT OFF WITH NO SUSPENSION BUT YOU WOULD THINK THAT AT THIS POINT NOW ITS TIME FOR YOU TO GROW AND MATURE AND PUT YOURSELF IN COMPROMISING SITUATIONS BECAUSE AGAIN AS A VETERAN IM DEPENDENT ON YOU.
I NEED GUYS IN THE LOCKER ROOM NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.
I WANT TO SEE MORE GROWTH AND MATURITY OUT OF ZEKE ELLIOTT.
I TOTALLY AGREE.
YOU TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER WITH THE CONTRACT SITUATION IF HES BEHAVING WITHOUT THAT BIG DEAL 45 MILLION GUARANTEED FROM AN ORGANIZATION STANDPOINT WHAT IS HE GOING TO BE LIKE ONCE HE HAS THAT MONEY?
NOT ONLY DO I HAVE PAUSE FOR CONCERN TO DO ANY DEAL BUT IF AND WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT NOW IM GOING TO REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STRUCTURE IS APPROPRIATE WHERE WILL GUARANTEED MONEY CERTAINLY IF HE GETS HURT PLAYING FOOTBALL.
WERE GOING TO HAVE THE TIEBLT IF THERES A THIRD BUMP IN THE ROAD IN TERMS OF ANYTHING OFF THE FIELD.
HES PUT HIMSELF IN THAT POSITION.
HES HAD TEAMMATES THAT PLAYED VERY WELL LIKE THE STARTING QUARTERBACK DAK PRESCOTT AND HANDLED THEIR BUSINESS OFF THE FIELD.
HES DONE THIS TO HIMSELF.
NOT ONLY WOULD I CONSIDER PAUSING AND NOT DOING A LONGTERM DEAL IF AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE POINT THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE AS AN ORGANIZATION SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS I WANT TO CUT THE PLAYER AND NOT HAVE TO PAY HIM MORE MONEY.
THATS THE KEY POINT.
IF SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS HE WAS WARNED WHEN HE WAS SUSPENDED IN 2017.
HE SEEMS DAMIAN SAID HE GOT LUCKY BUT THEY COULD HAVE SUSPENDED UNDER THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY GIVEN THAT WARNING.
BUT I MEAN THIS IS A TRANSCENDENT PLAYER WHO LED THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING TWO OF HIS THREE YEARS LED THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING THE YEAR HE WAS SUSPENDED.
TO GET TO THE POINT YOU RELEASE HIM THAT HAS TO BE A PRETTY EXTREME SITUATION DOESNT IT?
LISTEN WE KNOW HOW THE LEAGUE WORKS.
THE MORE TALENTED YOU ARE THE MORE OPPORTUNITIES YOU GET.
YOU SAID IT PERFECTLY THE TRANSCENDENT TALENT.
ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE IN OUR LEAGUE.
BUT AGAIN IF YOURE NOT AVAILABLE WHAT GOOD ARE YOU TO THE TEAM?
AGAIN YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ZEKE ELLIOTT MATURE AND GET PAST THESE INCIDENCES THAT WEVE SEEN FROM HIM THE THREE YEARS PLUS OF WHATEVER HES BEEN IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE SO HE CAN HELP HIS TEAM GET TO WHERE THEY WANT TO GO.
PRODUCTION EQUALS TOLERANCE.
BECAUSE HES PRODUCED AT SUCH A HIGH LEVEL HES BEEN A HIGH LEVEL POWER.
AT SOME POINT THAT EQUALS OUT.
HOPEFULLY HE CAN LEARN FROM THIS GROW AND PUT ALL THIS BEHIND HIM AND HELP THE COWBOY TRY TO WIN A SUPER BOWL.
EZEKIEL ELLIOTT REPRESENTS THE BIG NFL NEWS OF THE DAY.
ON ESPN THOUGH WE DONT LIMIT OURSELVES TO NFL.
OUR NEXT CANADIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE MATCHUP ON ESPN PLUS IS TOMORROW NIGHT.
ITS A FORMAT BETWEEN THE TIGER CATS AND THE MONTREAL AL OWE WETS.
THAT WILL BE AT 730 EASTERN.
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO SAY WE COULD BE AND SHOULD BE SUPER BOWL CONTENDERS.
WHO WOULDNT ASPIRE TO BE THE PATRIOTS.
WHO WOULDNT WANT TO BE 115?
I WANT TO GET TO BE WHAT THE PATRIOTS ARE.
THE CLEVELAND BROWNS GOING FROM THE HUNTER TO THE HUNTED NOW.
OH WHAT A CATCH BY NJOKU.
I FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID THE EXCITEMENT THAT I HAVE.
THEY HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING A CONTENDER IN THE AFC.
THEY HAVE NO EXCUSE.
CLEVELAND BROWNS DAVID NJOKU GETTING READY FOR A HIGHLY ANTICIPATED SEASON IN CLEVELAND.
DAVID WEVE SEEN SOME OF WHAT YOU GUYS CAN DO.
CERTAINLY INDIVIDUALLY.
WHAT WE HAVENT SEEN IS FREDDIE KITCHENS AS A HEAD COACH.
TELL US WHAT FREDDIE IS LIKE NOW THAT HES THE HEAD COACH?
FREDDIE IS A GREAT HEAD COACH.
I BELIEVE HES A PLAYERS COACH IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.
HE KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES FOR US TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
WE KNOW AS WELL.
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
HOPEFULLY GOOD THINGS HAPPEN.
SO WELL SEE.
BRINGING SOME STABILITY TO THAT SITUATION THIS YEAR.
OBVIOUSLY LAST YEAR THERE WASNT.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE GOING THROUGH THAT LAST YEAR WITH ALL THE TURMOIL AND THE FIRINGS AND ALL THAT STUFF IN MIDSEASON WITH THE COACHING STAFF.
HOW TOUGH WAS THAT?
YES IT WAS A BUNCH OF TURMOIL.
HAVING YOUR HEAD COACH AND O.C.
FIRED.
IT BROUGHT A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CURIOSITY BUT I FEEL LIKE AS A TEAM AND AS LIKE THE PLAYERS WE TOOK IT UPON OURSELVES TO YOU KNOW TO COME TOGETHER AND FOCUS ON HOW WE HAVE TO FINISH THIS YEAR OR THIS PAST YEAR STRONG.
AND I BELIEVE WE DID JUST THAT.
THIS UPCOMING YEAR WILL BE REALLY SPECIAL.
A LOT OF TIMES PLAYERS SAY THE FRONT OFFICE STUFF DOESNT AFFECT THE LOCKER ROOM.
WERE THERE HARD FEELINGS.
IT SEEMS LIKE BAKER MAYFIELD HAD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE SITUATION.
WAS THAT A WIDESPREAD FEELING?
THERES NO HARD FEELINGS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYONE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE TO TREAT IS AS SUCH.
THERES NO HARD FEELINGS.
WHATEVER HAPPENED HAPPENED.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
WERE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO REACH OUR GOAL.
YOU DIDNT LACK FOR TALENT ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL TO BEGIN WITH.
ODELL BECKHAM ESTABLISHED AS ONE OF THE TOP RECEIVING OPTIONS IN THE ENTIRE LEAGUE.
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN FROM HIM IN TERMS OF WHAT HES SHOWN YOU ON THE FIELD AND WHAT KIND OF TEAMMATE HE IS.
YEAH.
ODELL IS AN ELITE ATHLETE.
WERE ACTUALLY ALL TOGETHER YESTERDAY JARVIS HOLLYWOOD HIGGINS ME BAKER AND A BUNCH OF OTHER GUYS.
DEMETRIUS HARRIS BROWN WE WERE WORKING ON TIMING AND EVERYTHING.
WHEN IT COMES TO US AS A UNIT WE ARE VERY DANGEROUS IS THE WORD TO SAY.
HOW ABOUT PERSONAL GOALS FOR YOU?
OBVIOUSLY YOURE A YOUNG PLAYER STILL GROWING IN THIS LEAGUE WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT AND SAY HERES WHAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH GOING FORWARD?
AS LONG AS I FEELEY GAVE IT MY ALL I WORKED TO MY ABILITY IM CONTENT WITH THIS YEAR.
I DONT REALLY HAVE ANY NUMBERS.
I WAS MESSING AROUND SAYING 20 TOUCHDOWNS BUT HONESTLY SPEAKING I WANT TO HAVE A GREAT YEAR.
WE WANT TO WIN AND WIN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND OBVIOUSLY GO TO THE SUPER BOWL AND THATS WHAT THE BIG TERM GOAL.
WHEN YOURE LOOKING TO IMPROVE YOUR GAME IS THERE SOMETHING YOURE SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON YOURE TRYING TO GET BETTER AT?
OF COURSE.
HONESTLY SPEAKING IM WORKING ON ALL ASPECTS.
I DONT BELIEVE I MASTERED ANYTHING REGARDING THE TIGHT END POSITION JUST YET.
ITS REALLY EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO WORK ON TO BETTER MYSELF AS AN OVERALL TIGHT END AND PLAYER.
WERE GOING TO ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION IF THATS ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE EIGHT SIBLINGS IS THAT CORRECT?
YOURE ONE OF NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
CORRECT.
YOUR OLDER BROTHER INNOCENT STUDYING TO BE A NEUROLOGIST.
WHAT KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS  NEUROSURGEON.
EXCUSE ME.
MORE IMPRESSIVE.
WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS DO YOU HAVE ABOUT FOOTBALL AND THE DANGERS OF YOUR CHOSEN PROFESSION.
OBVIOUSLY HE UNDERSTANDS AS WELL AS I DO THAT FOOTBALL IS A DANGEROUS SPORT.
I HAVE TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS HE PLAYS AT MIAMI RIGHT NOW.
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI AND MY YOUNGEST ONE CHARLES NJOKU HE JUST ARRIVED AT UCLA TO START HIS SUMMER PROGRAM AS A RECEIVER.
THEY BOTH PLAY RECEIVERS.
WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT FOOTBALL IS OBVIOUSLY A DANGEROUS SPORT.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS OUR PASSION.
WE WORK EXTREMELY HARD TO BE THE BEST WE CAN BE.
MY OLDEST BROTHER INNOCENT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT.
HE LOVES OUR PASSION FOR IT.
BUT OBVIOUSLY HES THE ONE SAYING BE CAREFUL.
MAKE SURE YOURE SAFE AND EVERYTHING.
YEAH.
THATS PRETTY MUCH IT.
I GUESS IT CAN BE HANDY TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT IN THE FAMILY.
I ALWAYS TELL HIM THAT ONCE THE THREE OF US ARE DONE PLAYING FOOTBALL HE HAS TO TAKE CARE OF US IN ALL SHAPE AND FORM.
ITS ALL LOVE AT THE END OF THE DAY.
HOPEFULLY HE DOESNT HAVE MUCH TO DO IN THAT REGARD.
DAVID THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US BEST OF LUCK.
MY PLEASURE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BAKER MAYFIELD OVEN NJOKU JARVIS LANDRY RECEIVER ALONG WITH KAREEM HUNT IN THE BACKFIELD WHEN HUNTS SUSPENSION IS OVER.
THOSE FIVE COMBINED FOR 41 TOUCHDOWNS AND 641 TOUCHES.
SO I GUESS THE BIG QUESTION GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND IN THAT CLEVELAND BROWNS OFFENSE?
I LOT A LOT OF PIECES.
A GREAT COLLECTION OF TALENT.
THATS WHY IT FALLS ON FREDDIE KITCHENS.
THE CLEVELAND BROWNS ARE IN A POSITION THEY HAVENT BEEN IN A LONG TIME.
THEY ARE THE HUNTED.
ITS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT POSITION TO BE IN GOING FORWARD IN THE SEASON.
THEYLL BE ON PRIMETIME A LOT.
LETS SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH IT.
THE ONE THING WE DIDNT SEE ON THE GRAPHIC WAS THE LACK OF EXPERIENCE OF THEIR HEAD COACH FREDDIE KITCHENS.
I BELIEVE ONE DAY KITCHENS WILL BE A HEAD COACH.
ONE YEAR AGO GUYS HE WAS A POSITION COACH.
ITS LIKE LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE A CAR GOING 90 MILES AN HOUR IN THE LEFTHAND LANE AND IN THE DIVISION YOU HAVE JOHN HARBAUGH AND MIKE TOMLIN SINCE 2007.
HAS THE SECOND MOST WINS IN THE NFL.
JOHN HARBAUGH HAS THE SIXTH MOST WINS.
FROM A COACHING STANDPOINT HOW FREDDIE KITCHENS CAN MELD THAT GROUP WILL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH.
INTERESTING TO WATCH WHAT WE HAVE COMING STILL ON NFL LIVE TODAY.
WERE GOING TO HAVE MORE EZEKIEL ELLIOTT SITUATION.
COWBOYS RUNNING BACK NOT SUSPENDED BY THE NFL FOR HIS RECENT INCIDENT AND BECAUSE TOMORROW IS INDEPENDENCE DAY WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GREAT INDEPENDENT NFL PLAYS OF ALLTIME.
