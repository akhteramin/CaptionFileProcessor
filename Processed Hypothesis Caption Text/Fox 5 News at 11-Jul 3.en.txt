THAT'S A LOT TO KEEP TRACK OF FROM POOL PARTIES TO FIREWORKS FESTIVITIES.

"FOX5" JOSH ROSENTHAL IS LIVE NEAR LINCOLN MEMORIAL WITH THE LATEST,
HEY, JOSH.
HEY, SHAWRNGS YOU KNOW WE'RE LESS THAN 24 HOURS AWAY. AS YOU CAN SEE THIS YEAR'S FOUVRJ JULY WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN YEARS PAST.
IN MY MIND THIS IT GREAT.

CONGRESS DON'T GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND WANT TO WASTE ON THEIR PET PROJECTS WHY NOT HAVE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE US.
EVERYONE IS NOT QUITE SO PLEASED.
HERE'S THE DEAL WASHINGTON POSTS REPORTED NATIONAL PARK SERVICES DIVERTING 2.59 MILLION TO DIVERT COSTS.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON PARKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND POTHOLES ON CERTAIN ROAD RICK GW PARKWAY.
THERE'S A 1 IS 2 BILLION BACKLOG. MAINTENANCE NEEDS THE PARK SERVICE IS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PATLE.
THEY WANT TO PROTECT NATIONAL PARKS AND PROVIDE MONEY NECESSARY TO ADDRESS BACKLOG OF PARK SERVICE
AND THEN THEY USE VALUABLE DOLLARS FROM PARK VISITORS TO PAY FOR THIS SPECTACLE.
AND I REACHED OUT TO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND THEY DEPOSIT ANSWER ANY.
THEY SENT A STATEMENT DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING AMERICAN PEOPLE FANTASTIC CELEBRATION OF NATION'S BIRTHDAY
AND DOING SO CONSISTENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION AND HISTORICAL PRACTICES.
I WANT TO MENTION WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL TOTAL PRICE FAING TAG FOR THE EVENT.
HOWEVER SOME OF THE STUFF YOU SEE, FOR INSTANCE, EXTRA FOYER WORKS HAVE BEEN DONATESED
BACK TO YOU.
AND PRESIDENT SALUTE TO AMERICA TOMORROW IS EXPECTED TO ATTRACT PROTESTERS.
MEMBERS OF CODE PINK PLAN TO DEM SCAIT.
THE EVENT IS TURN INTO MILITARY STIFLE FORCE AND DOES NOT REPRESENT TRUE MEANING OF INDEPENDENCE DAY.
THEY WANTED TO FLY BADE TRUMP BALLOON WE HAVE SEEN IN LONDON AND OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE. THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE DEP EYED THE REQUEST.
EVEN FT. BALLOON CANNOT NATURE GROUP WILL TAKE A STAND.
WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO OPPOSE WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING
I'M D.C. RESIDENT AND WE KNOW THAT LAST TIME PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED TO HAVE A MILITARY PARADE D.C. RESIDENTS SPOKE OUT SO FORCEFULLY AND REPRESENTATIVES IN CITY COUNCIL SAID NO WAY.
CODE PINK AGAIN WANTED TO FLY THAT BABY TRUMP BALLOON TWO FEET OVER THE GROUND AND THE PARK SERVICE GROUNDED THAT IDEA.
THIS YEAR'S 4TH OF JULY PLANS ON NATIONAL MALL FORCE AIRPORTS TO CLOSE DOWN TEMPORARILY.
