APPLAUSE SARA HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE TALK.
HAPPY VALENTINES DAY EVERYBODY!
APPLAUSE NOW LETS GET STARTED WITH EMPIRE ALL RIGHT.
LETS GET STARTED WITH EMPIRE STAR JUSSIE SMOLLETT SPEAKING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER HIS ATTACK.
ITS BEEN 2 12 WEEKS SINCE JUSSIE SAID HE WAS ATTACKED IN CHICAGO BY TWO MEN WHO YELLED RACIAL AND HOMOPHOBIC SLURS PUNCHED HIM WRAPPED A ROPE AROUND HIS NECK THEN DOUSED HIM WITH BLEACH.
BECAUSE POLICE SAID JUSSIE INITIALLY REFUSED TO TURN OVER HIS PHONE RECORDS AND THAT THE ONES HE DID EVENTUALLY GIVE THEM WERE HEAVILY EDITED SOME PEOPLE HAVE ACCUSED THE STAR OF LYING.
TODAY JUSSIE SAT DOWN WITH G.M.A.
S ROBIN ROBERTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
IM PISSED OFF.
WHAT IS IT THAT HAS YOU SO ANGRY?
ITS THE ATTACKERS BUT ITS ALSO THE ATTACKS.
WANTING ME TO GIVE MY PHONE FOR THREE TO FOUR HOURS.
IM SORRY BUT IM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
WHY?
BECAUSE I HAVE PRIVATE PICTURES AND VIDEOS AND NUMBERS.
MY PARTNERS NUMBER.
MY FAMILYS NUMBER.
MY CASTMATES NUMBERS.
MY FRIENDS NUMBERS.
MY PRIVATE EMAILS.
SONGS.
VOICE MEMOS.
I DONT KNOW WHAT THATS GOING TO BE TO HAND OVER MY PHONE.
APPLAUSE SARA WHILE CHICAGO POLICE HAVE SCREENED LOTS OF FOOTAGE FROM NEIGHBORHOOD SECURITY CAMERAS THEY STILL HAVE NOT FOUND VIDEO OF THE ACTUAL ATTACK.
JUSSIE SHARED HIS FRUSTRATION.
I WANT THAT VIDEO FOUND SO BADLY BECAUSE FOR PROBABLY FOUR REASONS.
NUMBER ONE I WANT THEM TO FIND THE PEOPLE THAT DID IT.
NUMBER TWO I WANT THEM TO STOP BEING ABLE TO SAY ALLEGED ATTACK.
NUMBER THREE I WANT THEM TO SEE THAT I FOUGHT BACK.
AND I WANT A LITTLE GAY BOY WHO MIGHT WATCH THIS TO SEE THAT I FOUGHT BEEP BACK.
AND IT DOES NOT TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT.
BUT I FOUGHT BACK.
THEY RAN OFF.
I DIDNT.
APPLAUSE SARA AND WE HAVE THIS NEW UPDATE FROM CHICAGO POLICE WHO ANNOUNCED THEY ARE QUESTIONING TWO PERSONS OF INTEREST IN CONNECTION WITH JUSSIES ATTACK.
POLICE STRESS NEITHER PERSON HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH A CRIME AND AS OF NOW THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THEY WERE INVOLVED.
SO DO YOU THINK SPEAKING OUT IS THE BEST WAY TO SHUT DOWN SKEPTICS?
AUDIENCE YES!
SHARON OH ABSOLUTELY.
AND I IVE GOT TO YOU KNOW SIDE WITH JUSSIE ON THE THING THAT I DONT WANT MY PHONE TO BE LOOKED AT.
OR MY NUDE SHOTS AND THINGS.
NO.
APPLAUSE OURS.
HOURS AND HOURS OF SEXUAL FOOTAGE OF MYSELF.
NO I I WOULDNT WANT MY PHONE TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND ANALYZED.
I JUST WOULDNT WANT IT.
NOT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN ITS MY PERSONAL LIFE ON THERE.
AND I JUST WOULDNT WANT IT.
SO I TOTALLY GET THAT WITH HIM.
AND I TOTALLY GET THAT HE MIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW DELETED SOME THINGS AND ITS HARD.
I MEAN HES BEEN THROUGH A REALLY TOUGH TIME.
SARA AND THE MEDIA HAS REALLY CAST SO MUCH DOUBT ON HIS STORY WHICH I FIND SO PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE THAT A GAY BLACK MAN IS TARGETED AND THEN SUDDENLY HE BECOMES THE VICTIM OF PEOPLES DISBELIEF?
ITS SO  APPLAUSE AND THERE HAVE BEEN THINGS LIKE WELL WHY WOULD HE BE GETTING A SUBWAY SANDWICH AT 200 A.M.
HE SAID WELL THEYRE HOPE AT THAT TIME BECAUSE PEOPLE GO.
SHARON WE GO.
I GO.
SARA OR PEOPLE SAY IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD YOU COULDNT GET A SAYS WHO?
I MEAN ITS JUST LIKE THESE SORT OF RIDICULOUS THINGS WHERE I FEEL LIKE WHY DONT WE BELIEVE THIS PERSON?
WHY?
EVE IT REALLY IS SAD AND WITH ALL THAT HE HAS BEEN THROUGH THE FACT THAT HE HAS TO COME OUT.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA THERES SO MANY OPINIONS ITS BETTER TO HEAR IT FROM HIS OWN MOUTH AND AND FEEL HIS ENERGY.
AND IM GLAD WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED I AM HAPPY THAT HE YOU KNOW IS BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO SIT WITH ROBIN ROBERTS AND SHARE HIS STORY.
SHERYL AND IF THE NAYSAYERS KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK HAPPENED WHY YOU DONT KNOW WHO DID IT?
SINCE YOU KNOW SO MUCH.
APPLAUSE TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW AND I HATE THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN A SOCIAL MEDIA EVEN THE COMMON PERSON USUALLY ITS THE CELEBRITY AND THEIR FANS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS.
NOW ITS EVEN THE COMMON PERSON WHO MAY HAVE SOMETHING HAPPEN TO THEM THAT THEYRE GOING TO THEIR SUPPORTERS OR WHATEVER FOR ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
THATS WHY PEOPLE DONT WANT TO TALK.
THATS WHY PEOPLE DONT WANT TO COME FORWARD BECAUSE THEYRE GOING TO BE JUDGED.
AND THAT DOESNT HELP THE SITUATION.
APPLAUSE SARA WELL WHAT I HOPE IS THAT I HOPE THAT THE POLICE ARE ONTO SOMETHING WITH THESE TWO PERSONS OF INTEREST.
I HOPE THEY GET THEM AND THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW AS A MEDIA AND AS CULTURE WE TWIST THINGS AND CAST DOUBT ON THINGS THAT WE SHOULD NOT CAST DOUBT ON.
APPLAUSE SHERYL WILL PEOPLE APOLOGIZE?
WHEN THE TRUTH COME OUT WILL YOU APOLOGIZE AS HARD AS YOU JUDGED HIM?
WILL YOU APOLOGIZE?
APPLAUSE SARA I HOPE.
SO BUT I DOUBT IT.
IN OTHER NEWS A 19YEAROLD WANNA BE INSTAGRAM INFLUENCER WITH LESS THAN 4000 FOLLOWERS THREW TWO CHAIRS OFF A 45TH STORY BALCONY IN TORONTO OVER THE WEEKEND PRESUMABLY TO GET MORE LIKES.

ITS RIDICULOUS.
WHY RISK PEOPLES LIVES?
FOR A MOMENT OF JUST INTERNET FAME?

POLICE THINK IT WAS TWO CHAIRS FOUND IN A HEAP AT THE BASE OF THE BUILDING.
SARA SHE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ENDANGERING LIFE AND HAS NOW BEEN RELEASED ON 1500 BAIL AND ORDERED TO LIVE WITH HER MOTHER.
SO DO YOU THINK ALL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SHOULD BAN HER FOR LIFE?
AUDIENCE YES!
SHARON OH OH YEAH.
I MEAN HERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A YOUNG PERSON WHO WANTS INSTANT FAME INSTANT YOU KNOW THE RECOGNITION EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH IT FOR NOTHING.
EXCEPT BEING STUPID IGNORANT NO TALENT.
APPLAUSE WHY WOULD YOU 45 I CANT EVEN BELIEVE THAT THE WINDOW OPENED ON THE 45TH FLOOR.
BUT HOWEVER IT DID.
AND HER CHUCKING CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THAT HAD HIT A CAR?
THEN THAT CAR WOULD HAVE CRASHED INTO ANOTHER CAR AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER.
I MEAN THE THOUGHT OF IT JUST MAKES YOU SHIVER.
ITS JUST RIDICULOUS THAT THESE WANNABE KIDS OUT THERE THINK OVERNIGHT THEYRE GOING TO GET FAME AND FORTUNE FOR BEING PATHETIC.
YOU ARE A PATHETIC YOUNG GIRL.
APPLAUSE SHE WANTS TO BE WHY DONT YOU WORK ON YOUR WRITING?

I was thrilled to be able to go with my friends to our annual gettogether especially after being diagnosed last year with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer.
Another TRU story with KEYTRUDA.
I started Katy on KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy and shes getting results we rarely saw five years ago.
In a clinical trial significantly more patients lived longer and saw their tumors shrink than on chemotherapy alone.
Its changed my approach to treating patients.
KEYTRUDA may be used with certain chemotherapies as your first treatment if you have advanced nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer and you do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene.
KEYTRUDA helps your immune system fight cancer but can also cause your immune system to attack healthy parts of your body.
This can happen during or after treatment and may be severe and lead to death.
See your doctor right away if you have new or worse cough chest pain shortness of breath diarrhea severe stomach pain or tenderness nausea or vomiting rapid heartbeat increased hunger or thirst constipation dizziness or fainting changes in urine or eyesight muscle pain or weakness joint pain confusion or memory problems fever rash itching or flushing.
These are not all the possible side effects.
Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions including immune system problems if youve had an organ transplant had or plan to have a stem cell transplant or have lung breathing or liver problems.
Where I am now compared to a year ago its a story worth sharing.
Living longer is possible.
Its TRU.
KEYTRUDA from Merck.
With more FDAapproved uses for advanced lung cancer than any other immunotherapy.
CARRIE ANN JUSTIN BIEBER IS REPORTEDLY PUTTING HIS WEDDING PLANS ON HOLD BECAUSE OF HIS MENTAL HEALTH.
JUSTIN AND HIS WIFE WERE MARRIED IN A SECRET CEREMONY LAST YEAR AND HAD PLANNED TO SAY I DO AGAIN IN A RELIGIOUS SERVICE BUT THOSE PLANS HAVE BEEN DELAYED WHILE JUSTIN SEEKS COUNSELING FOR HIS DEPRESSION.
PEOPLE MAGAZINE SAYS THE 24YEAROLD HAS FELT OVERWHELMED BY FAME.
THE SOURCE SAYS BEING FOLLOWED HAVING HIS EVERY MOVE STALKED BY FANS CAMERAS IN HIS FACE IT ALL SETS HIM OFF.

APPLAUSE CARRIE ANN THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MY FATHER DIED BEFORE DANCING WITH THE STARS LIKE FOUR DAYS BEFORE.
AS I FELT MYSELF GOING INTO A DEPRESSION.
BUT I HAD TO PUT IT OFF.
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS AS WELL?
THERES A TIME I HAD TO PUT LIKE A STEEL WALL BETWEEN ME AND MY EMOTIONS SO I COULD GET THROUGH THE SEASON WITH DANCING WITH THE STARS AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING.
I HAD JUST BROKEN UP WITH MY FIANCE MY DAD DIED I MOVED I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS.
I KNEW I DIDNT HAVE TIME.
BUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS YOU SHOULDNT PUSH OFF YOUR EMOTIONS UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A TIME TO DEAL WITNESS.
THATS THE PART THAT WAS KEY.
I KNEW AFTER THE SEASON WAS OVER I DO SPEND LIKE THREE MONTHS JUST TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.
I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT.
BUT I HAD IT ALMOST THE OPPOSITE.
SARA DID YOU FEEL DURING THAT TIME THAT YOU WERE ACTING OUT AT ALL OR HAVING WEIRD EMOTIONS KIND OF SNEAK OUT?
CARRIE ANN YEAH.
THEY DOO SNEAK OUT.
EMOTIONS REMOTIONS.
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TEMPO DESIRES TO COME OUT.
AND THEY WILL FIND A WAY OUT.
YOU CAN PUT THEM OFF.
YOU KNOW DANCING WITH THE STARS IS 10 WEEKS OUT OF THE YEAR.
FOR 10 WEEKS I COULD KIND OF PUT THEM ON HOLD.
I WOULD WATCH AND ANDY DICK WAS ON OUR SHOW.
I LOST IT.
IT WAS REALLY SIMPLE.
MY OWN EMOTIONS WITH MY OWN LIFE COMING OUT.
SHERYL BUT THEN WHAT DID YOU DO ONCE YOU HAD THAT TIME?
CARRIE ANN I WENT TO COUNSELING.
THERES SO MANY GREAT BOOKS TO READ.
I BOUGHT EVERY BOOK I COULD FIND ON DEPRESSION.
AND I WENT AND SAW MY FRIENDS AND MY SUPPORT SYSTEM.
I WAS VERY LUCKY.
SARA WELL BE RIGHT BACK.

BEEP.
HE TOLD ME HE COULDNT BELIEVE THE WOMAN BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THIS BLUE JEEP WOULD SWERVE PAST HIM BEFORE RUNNING STRAIGHT INTO A GROUP OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET NARROWLY MISSING THEM.
IT SEEMED LIKE HER INTENTION WAS TO RUN THEM OVER.
IT WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD SNOWBALL FIGHT THAT WENT WRONG.
THE PERSON SEEN IN THE VIDEO TRYING TO HOLD THE WOMAN DOWN SAID SHE GOT UPSET BECAUSE HER CAR WAS HIT BY ONE OF THE SNOWBALLS.
THE WOMANS CAR ENDED UP GETTING STUCK IN THE SNOW.
NEIGHBORS CALLED POLICE AND HER ARREST WAS ALSO CAUGHT ON CAMERA.
AUTHORITIES SAID THE WOMAN NOW IDENTIFIED IS FACING CHARGES OF D.U.I.
AND RECKLESS DRIVING.

WHY DIDNT YOU GET INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT?
SHE COULD HAVE JUMPED OUT THE CAR BALLED A SNOWBALL UP AND SAID I GOT YOU THEN WOULD IT HAVE BEEN FUN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
