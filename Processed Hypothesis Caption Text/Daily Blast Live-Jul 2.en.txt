WELCOME TO DAILY BLAST LIVE, 
IT IS TUESDAY, MAY 7, WE ARE ALIVE AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.
I AM HERE WITH TORY, JEFF, AL, AND I AM SAM.
LET'S GET STARTED.
WE HAVE OUR BRAND-NEW INTERVIEW WITH POP SENSATION PENTATONIC JOINING US FROM THEIR FIRST- EVER WORLD TOUR BUS.
PLUS WE HAVE FASHION SECRETS, 
WE ARE TELLING YOU HOW YOU CAN LOOK YOUR BEST WITHOUT UPSTAGING THE BRIDE. COME ON NOW, ADMITTED.
THE STARS BROUGHT THEIR CRAZIEST MOST OVER-THE-TOP LOOKS EVER TO THIS YEAR'S MED GALA.
THE THEME WAS CAMP. NOTES ON FASHION, AND EVERYONE WAS EXPECTED TO PULL OUT THE STOPS. WHAT IS CAMP?
IT IS DEFINED AS THE LOVE OF THE UNNATURAL, ARTIFICE, AND EXAGGERATION. BASICALLY, EVERYTHING THAT IS FABULOUS IRONIC OR EXTRA.
LET'S GET TO THE FASHION AND TITLE THIS YEAR FOR MOST LIVED GOES TO KATY PERRY WHETHER YOU HATE IT OR LIKE IT, SHE DEFINITELY IS HAVING PEOPLE TALKING.
SHE WORE THIS ILLUMINATED CHANDELIER LOOK CREATED FOR HER BY JEREMY,
KIM KARDASHIAN SHOWED OFF HER FIGURE IN A SKINTIGHT LATEX COURSE ADDRESS,

BLAIR CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT TO CREATE A LOOK WHICH TOOK GUYS EIGHT MONTHS TO COMPLETE BY THE WAY, 
IT APPEARED TO BE DRIPPING WET THANKS TO THE CRYSTALS AND SHIMMERING MATERIAL.
KATIE HOLMES AND JAMIE FOXX MADE A PUBLIC DEBUT AS A COUPLE LAST NIGHT 
WHILE THEY DIDN'T HIT THE PINK CARPET TOGETHER, THE COUPLE DID POSE FOR PHOTOS WITH ONE ANOTHER INSIDE AND KENDALL AND KYLIE JENNER BROKE OUT THE FEATHERS, 
TETHER WORE A BRIGHT ORANGE FOR SUCH A DOWN, WHILE KYLIE WENT FOR A MATCHING WIG.
JANEL MONET EMBRACED WEARABLE ART WITH THIS CUSTOM LOOK, AND EVEN WINKED AS SHE CUT DOWN THE CARPET.
LADY GAGA SERVED AT MULTIPLE LOOKS, ALL CREATED BY BRANDON MAXWELL, 
IT STARTED OFF WITH A HUGE PINK DRESS, IT TOOK AN ARMY OF MEN WITH UMBRELLAS, SHE THEN STRIPPED DOWN TO A BLACK DRESS FOLLOWED BY A SKINTIGHT PINK DRESS AND THEN IT ALL ENDED UP WITH HER POSING IN HER UNDERWEAR, HERE IT COMES.
YES GIRL. HUGE PLATFORM SHOES.
SERENA WILLIAMS WORE THIS STUNNING NEON YELLOW EVER SOUGHT YOU DOWN WITH PINK NEON ACCENTS, PAIRING HER LOOK WITH NEON NIKES.
JENNIFER LOPEZ SPARKLED IN THIS BEADED VERSE ARCHIE DRESS WITH A PLUNGING NECKLINE AND FRINGE DETAILING, 
SHE WORE A MATCHING HEADPIECE OF COURSE A-ROD IS A GOOD ACCESSORY, RIGHT?

LIVE ETA EMBRACED THE RAINBOW WITH THIS VERSE ARCHIE GOWN, PINK STAR PAM DOWN RUFFLES, CHECK OUT THE GOLD AFRO PITS IN HER HAIR, WITH RAISED FIST LOGOS. YES.
JARED LETTER, MY FAVORITE, HAD THE BEST ACCESSORY OF A NICE, 
CUSTOM REPLICA, OF HIS HEAD.

CASEY MUSGRAVE LOOK LIKE A BARBIE DOLL IN THIS DRESS. PAIRING IT WITH A BLOW DRYER BAG AND CAT EYE SHADES.
CARDY B WON THE AWARD FOR THIS GOWN, 
THE 10 FOOT LONG TRAIN IT NEARLY TOOK OVER THE PINK CARPET. SIERRA MIGHT HAVE ONE BEST TEAR OF THE NIGHT, I THINK SHE ONE LET'S BE HONEST WITH THIS VERY EXTRA GORGEOUS AFRO, 
SHE ALSO WORE A CUSTOM EMERALD GREEN CROWN BECAUSE SHE IS A QUEEN AND SUNDAY I HAD A FAIRLY -- FAIRYTALE MOMENT TRANSFORMING INTO CINDERELLA IN THIS TOMMY HILFIGER BALLGOWN WITH A SKIRT THAT LIT UP. YES YES YES.
YOU DRINK SOME WATER. WE WILL TALK.
I ACTUALLY LOOKED AT JEFF MIDWAY AND HER EYES WERE CLOSED.
I WAS OUT, 
I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT CHEESE AND CRACKERS AND WHAT I WILL DO TONIGHT.
WAS THINKING 
IS THIS COFFEE IS BETTER, I SHOULD THINK ABOUT A DIFFERENT KIND OF COFFEE.
I GUESS I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO REALLY APPRECIATES THE LOOK AS ART.

THEY'RE THERE TO ENTERTAIN US.

LIKE SOMEBODY HAS TO SHAKE IT UP A BIT, WE CAN'T ALL WEAR KHAKIS AND POLO SHIRTS. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SHAKE IT UP AND PUSH THE ENVELOPE.
I'M FOR UNIVERSAL UNIFORMS EVERY DAY.
STAR TREK?
YESTERDAY 
BORING.
I WEAR THE SAME THING TO WORK EVERY DAY, THAT'S FINE FOR ME.
DESPITE I DO THE SAME THING.
TORY, DID YOU HAVE A FAVORITE EVEN IF YOU WERE BORED BY IT?
I DID HAVE A FAVORITE.
EZRA MILLER ABSOLUTELY NAILED CAMP, AND THIS IS A GUY WHO IS GENDER FLUID AND HE USED PROSTHETICS, YOU REALLY GOT THOSE WEREN'T REALIZE?
