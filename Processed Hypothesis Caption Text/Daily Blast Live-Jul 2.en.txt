PAIRING IT WITH A BLOW DRYER BAG AND CAT EYE SHADES.
CARDY B WON THE AWARD FOR THIS GOWN THE 10 FOOT LONG TRAIN IT NEARLY TOOK OVER THE PINK CARPET.
SIERRA MIGHT HAVE ONE BEST TEAR OF THE NIGHT I THINK SHE ONE LETS BE HONEST WITH THIS VERY EXTRA GORGEOUS AFRO SHE ALSO WORE A CUSTOM EMERALD GREEN CROWN BECAUSE SHE IS A QUEEN AND SUNDAY I HAD A FAIRLY  FAIRYTALE MOMENT TRANSFORMING INTO CINDERELLA IN THIS TOMMY HILFIGER BALLGOWN WITH A SKIRT THAT LIT UP.
YES YES YES.
YOU DRINK SOME WATER.
WE WILL TALK.
I ACTUALLY LOOKED AT JEFF MIDWAY AND HER EYES WERE CLOSED.
I WAS OUT I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT CHEESE AND CRACKERS AND WHAT I WILL DO TONIGHT.
WAS THINKING IS THIS COFFEE IS BETTER I SHOULD THINK ABOUT A DIFFERENT KIND OF COFFEE.
I GUESS IM THE ONLY ONE WHO REALLY APPRECIATES THE LOOK AS ART.
THEYRE THERE TO ENTERTAIN US.
LIKE SOMEBODY HAS TO SHAKE IT UP A BIT WE CANT ALL WEAR KHAKIS AND POLO SHIRTS.
SOMEBODYS GOT TO SHAKE IT UP AND PUSH THE ENVELOPE.
IM FOR UNIVERSAL UNIFORMS EVERY DAY.
STAR TREK?
YESTERDAY BORING.
I WEAR THE SAME THING TO WORK EVERY DAY THATS FINE FOR ME.
DESPITE I DO THE SAME THING.
TORY DID YOU HAVE A FAVORITE EVEN IF YOU WERE BORED BY IT?
I DID HAVE A FAVORITE.
EZRA MILLER ABSOLUTELY NAILED CAMP AND THIS IS A GUY WHO IS GENDER FLUID AND HE USED PROSTHETICS YOU REALLY GOT THOSE WERENT REALIZE?
NOW I DONT KNOW WHY I SAID BUT ITS ABOUT THE ARTIFICE AND EXAGGERATION OF THE LIKE TO THE GENDER FLUIDITY THAT WAS ALL OVER THE RED CARPET.
PINK CARPET EXCUSE ME.
I LOVE THAT TOO.
IM GOING TO NOD MY HEAD AND PRETEND I KNOW WHAT ARTIFICE MEANS.
ARTIFICIAL MISS.
CAMP IS VERY CATCHY AND FAKE AND OVERDONE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
CAMPY.
WE DO CALL YOU AL FASHION YOU HAD TO HAVE A FAVORITE?
MY BOY NICK JONAS.
YOUR BOY?
WE GO WAY BACK.
HE LOOKS LIKE A WAITER AT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY DOESNT HE?
IN DUBAI.
THE DUBAI CHEESECAKE FACTORY.
YOU NAILED IT.
JEFF DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE?
I KNOW EVERYONE HATES THE GENDERS I SHOULD SAY CHECK THEM OUT BUT I LIKE HOW THEY DIDNT WALK WITH THEIR DATES DOWN THE CARPET.
THATS A GOOD ONE.
LISTEN.
I THINK ALL THE WORK THESE FASHION DESIGNERS PUT INTO THESE OUTFITS I REALLY WANT TO GIVE THEM SOME CREDIT.
WHO WAS YOUR FAVORITE?
JANEL MONET.
THAT DRESS IS ART YOU GUYS.
AGAIN WITH THE GENDER FLUIDITY I THINK THAT JARED LETTER WITH THAT GORGEOUS RED DOWN AND WHO DOESNT LOVE A SEVERED HEAD AS A PURSE.
I DONT THINK ANYONE KNOWS HES WEARING A GOWN I THINK THATS THE WAY YOU DO IT IS YOU JUST CARRY HUNDRED I DIDNT REALIZE IT WAS A DOWN UNTIL YOU SAID SOMETHING.
THAT WAS A PURSE?
OR AN ACCESSORY BUT HE HELD IT LIKE A PURSE.
HE SURE DID.
IM ALL FOR IT.
WHAT IF MARK SHOWED UP WITH A PURSE OF YOUR HEAD?
FASHION.
EXACTLY.
LETS GET TO THIS NEXT STORY.
AN UPDATE TO THE COLLEGE ADMISSION SCANDAL.
LORI LOCKLINS DEFENSE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A BOOST THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAS CREW TEAM.
REPORTING THIS OUT FOR THE TEAM POSTING ALL OVER CAMPUS.
YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS NO EXPERIENCE NO PROBLEM SOME SAY THE POSTER COULD HELP THE DEFENSE.
HER DAUGHTERS LACK OF EXPERIENCE THE TEAM DOESNT REQUIRE EXPERIENCE TO JOIN LORI OF COURSE IS ACCUSED OF PAYING BRIBES TO TOSS PASS HER OFF AS ATHLETIC RECRUITS IN ORDER TO GET THEM INTO USC.
NOW TORY I KNOW YOU ARE OUR LEGAL EAGLE.
THIS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL BECAUSE IF LORI LOCKLIN IS GOING TO USE THIS AS A DEFENSE SHE IS SUGGESTING THAT ALL OF US ARE STUPID.
SHE IS SUGGESTING THAT EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO HAS WORKED HARD TO GET INTO A UNIVERSITY WHETHER YOU ARE AN ASSET ATHLETE WHETHER YOU ARE A SCHOLAR AGAIN IS A STUPID.
COULD THIS WORK FOR HER?
IT COULD GO BOTH WAYS.
BACKFIRE COMPLETELY BECAUSE IT IS SO OBVIOUS.
WE HAVE HER ON TAPE BEING LIKE TAKE A PICTURE OF THEM AND SEND IT IN.
WE KNOW THE REAL THING.
SHE INSULTED SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN PLEADING NOT GUILTY.
THATS WHERE SHE MADE A MISTAKE AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.
IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON TO BE LIKE MAYBE SHE DID NOT KNOW THOUGH.
SO THEY ARE USING THE LOOPHOLE DEFENSE ITS A HAIL MARY BUT IT HAS WORKED BEFORE.
ALL SHE WANTS TO DO IS AVOID PRISON TIME.
I THINK SHES GOING TO DO THAT.
I DONT THINK SO.
LISTEN.
SHE IS NOT CALLING US STUPID.
OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS CALLING US STUPID.
THE PEOPLE WHO DEFEND HER ARE CALLING US STUPID BECAUSE IF SHE GETS OFF IT JUST PROVES THAT OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK.
THATS WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
YOU CAN BUY YOUR WAY OUT OF JAIL.
MANY WOULD ARGUE OUR SYSTEM WORKS IN THE OPPOSITE WAY BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE LOCKED OUT FOR SENDING YOUR KID TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN A DIFFERENT ZIP CODE.
YES.
AL DOES THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WORK OR DOES IT NOT WORK DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT INSIDE THAT LENS?
I THINK IT IS WORKING PERFECTLY.
IT CATERS TO THE RICH.
IF YOU ARE RICH YOU DONT SEE JAIL AS A DETERRENT.
ANYBODY THAT HAS MONEY YOU CAN GET A GOOD ATTORNEY THEY COST DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY SOME OF THEM FREE SOME WILL SAY TAKE THE DEAL.
A GREAT LAWYER WILL GO THROUGH EVERYTHING.
ALL THEY NEED IS ONE THING AND THAT IS WHY YOU PAY THAT MONEY.
IF YOU HAVE MONEY YOURE GOING TO GET THAT LAWYER AND THEY WILL GET YOU OFF.
THAT IS WHY JEFF FEELS LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT IS TRUE.
SHAME ON HER AND SHAME ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
WE NEED REFORM AND WE NEED REFORM NOW.
DAILY BLAST LIVE IS LIVE WE BRING YOU BREAKING NEWS AS IT HAPPENS COMING UP A CAPPELLA NEVER SOUNDED SO GOOD.
THE BAND PENTATONIC TAKES TIME TO CHAT WITH US IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR FIRSTEVER WORLD TOUR.
THEN AN EYEOPENING STUDY ALL ABOUT SUNSCREEN.
THE SURPRISING NEW FINDINGS THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU RETHINK THE KIND OF SUNBLOCK YOU USE YOU THE VIEWER ARE OUR FIFTH HOUSTON WE WANT YOUR TAKE ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL STORY.
A BARTENDER IS IN TROUBLE AFTER PROSECUTORS SAY SHE OVERSERVED A MAN RIGHT BEFORE GOING ON A SHOOTING RAMPAGE.
SHOULD SHE BE CHARGED WITH THE CRIME SENDING COMMENTS RIGHT NOW WE WILL READ THEM LIVE NEXT.
WELCOME BACK.
IT IS TIME FOR FIFTH POST WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A TEXAS BARTENDER HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED FOR OVER SERVING A MAN THE NIGHT HE SHOT AND KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE.
LINDSAY GLASS IS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING A STATE LAW BY SELLING ALCOHOL TO AN INTOXICATED OR INSANE PERSON.
POLICE SAY SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN TO STOP SERVING THE MAN BECAUSE HE APPEARED DRUNK AND ARMED.
TURNED OUT HIS BLOODALCOHOL LEVEL WAS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT.
AFTER LEAVING THE BAR THE MAN KILLED HIS ESTRANGED WIFE AND SEVEN OTHERS BEFORE DYING IN A POLICE SHOOTOUT.
THE BARTENDER NOW FACES UP TO A YEAR IN PRISON A FINE OF 500 OR BEST SHOULD SHE BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME.
NOW SHE WOULDNT BE CHARGED FOR MURDER THIS WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR SO TO SPEAK AT THIS POINT TO CLARIFY THAT I THINK THE BARTENDER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING PATRONS FROM BECOMING UNREASONABLY INTOXICATED.
BUT ONLY THE SHOOTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MURDER.
BOBBY GREAT TAKE.
YOU USE THE WORD THERE UNREASONABLY INTOXICATED.
FOUR TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT MEANS YOU PROBABLY CANT STAND UP.
THE FACT THAT THIS MAN WAS ARMED TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS AWARE OF IT I THINK SHE SHOULD BE IMPLICATED IN SOME WAY MY WHOLE THING IM NOT THROWING PEOPLE IN JAIL THE SHOULD BE USED TO TEACH OTHER PEOPLE YOU SHOULDNT HAVE TO TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO SERVE DRUNK PEOPLE WITH GUNS BUT SOME PEOPLE GOT TO LEARN THEIR LESSON I GUESS.
PATTY FROM FACEBOOK SAYS BARS ARE JUST OUT TO MAKE MONEY THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF ALCOHOL THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE.
SAM YOU WERE A BARTENDER THERE ARE STRICT LAWS ABOUT SERVING PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN REASONABLY SEE OUR OVERSERVED.
THEY MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF YOU.
IN LOS ANGELES ITS A CORPORATION CALLED ABC THEY TRAIN YOU AND LET YOU KNOW ABOUT RED FLAGS.
GOD FORBID YOU EVER SERVE SOMEONE BOTH JEFF AND I HAVE CUT MANY PEOPLE OFF.
WE HAVE BOTH SEEN PEOPLE OUR COLLEAGUES DRAGGED OUT OF THAT BAR IN HANDCUFFS BECAUSE OF A DUI YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE YOU YOURSELF.
THOUGHT OUT THE BACK DOOR THEY MAKE SURE THEY SEE THEM AT THE FRONT DOOR IT IS A BIG DEAL.
ALCOHOL IS A DRUG.
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE LIABLE.
IF YOU ARE A GUN MAKER SELLING TO AN UNDERAGE PERSON BY MISTAKE YOU ARE LIABLE IF THEY SHOOT SOMEONE YOU ARE ALSO LIABLE.
SHE BROKE THE LAW.
BUT I DO WANT TO SET THIS UP THOUGH WE TALK ABOUT THIS STORY WE SET UP FOR A MINUTE WE DONT KNOW IF THIS GUY WAS COMING UP TO THE BAR WE DONT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
OBVIOUSLY IVE SEEN SOMEONE FALL OUT OF THE CHAIR I KNOW TO CUT THEM OFF.
IF THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE I DONT KNOW.
IN SPITE OF THE DRINKING AND THE BACK ROOM?
DID A DRINK BEFORE THEY CAME?
THERES A LOT THAT GOES INTO THIS WEEKEND JUST TO SPECULATE ON WHAT THE BARTENDER DID OR DID NOT SEE.
MARCUS FROM PITTSBURGH SAYS HOW COULD THE BARTENDER HAVE KNOWN WHAT THIS GUY WAS GOING TO DO AFTER LEAVING.
HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS.
MARCUS I LOVE YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
ACCOUNTABILITY.
I THINK A WORD THAT HAS BEEN ERASED FROM THE DICTIONARY.
BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS NOT BECAUSE YOUR FIFTH GRADE TEACHER GAVE YOU AN AND CALLED YOU A NAME THAT IS WHY YOU WENT AND SHOT UP EVERYBODY NOT BECAUSE THE BARTENDER OVER SURETY OVERSERVED YOU HOLD THIS MAN ACCOUNTABLE.
DOES THIS LADY NEED TO DO HER JOB DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES?
MAYBE.
THIS MAN IS ACCOUNTABLE NOT ANYBODY ELSE.
HES THE ONE WHO KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE LETS NOT FORGET THAT THEIR DISPATCH THANKS GREAT TAKES EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR WRITING APPEARED COMING UP EAT BETTER SLEEP BETTER.
I AM ALREADY SOLD.

WELCOME BACK TO DBL.
MAKING THE RIGHT FOOD CHOICES CAN BE TOUGH TORY MEETS UP WITH A NUTRITIONIST TO LEARN ABOUT FOODS THAT WILL HELP YOU SLEEP BETTER TAKE A LOOK.
HI GUYS WE ARE HERE WITH SARAH PETER HOLISTIC NUTRITIONIST AT FAMILY NUTRITION SERVICES SHE IS HERE TO TELL US HOW FOOD CAN AFFECT YOUR SLEEP.
I KNOW.
TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW SLEEP AND EATING GO TOGETHER BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.
WHO HASNT HAD TROUBLE SLEEPING AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER.
I KNOW I HAVE.
WHAT ARE SPECIFIC FOODS?
THERE ARE FOODS RICH IN AMINO ACID CALLED CALLED TRYPTOPHAN.
THE FIRST ONE IS TURKEY.
RIGHT THATS WHAT EVERYONE IS SO SLEEPY AND THANKS GIVING.
NUTS ARE ACCESSIBLE SOURCE OF TRYPTOPHAN.
JUST EATING A BIT A DAY CAN BOOST YOUR TRYPTOPHAN LEVELS POINT YOU BE NUTS NOT TO DO IT.
TOTALLY NUTS.
WHAT ELSE OTHER THAN NUTS?
MY FAVORITE ONE OF ALL IS CHERRIES.
CHERRIES WHEN THEY CONTAIN MELATONIN BUT ACTUALLY JUST HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR BODIES ON PRODUCTION OF MELATONIN.
THIS IS SLEEP HORMONE IS ONE OF THE HORMONES THAT REGULATES OUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM.
CHERRIES NUTS WHAT ELSE?
FISH.
ACTUALLY IS A SLEEP REMEDY NOT THOUGHT OF BUT IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF VITAMIN B6.
B6 HELPS YOU SLEEP?
VITAMIN B6 IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT FOR THAT CONVERSION OF TRYPTOPHAN TO SEROTONIN.
I SEE POINT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NUTS AMINO ACIDS IN OUR BODIES USE TO CONVERT TO SEROTONIN BUT IF YOU ARE LOW IN B6 THAT CONVERSION DOESNT IT LAYS QUITE AS NATURALLY.
I WANT TO THANK SARAH PETER NOW FOR DEALING WITH ME FIRST OFFENSE FOR TEACHING US ACCESSIBLE THINGS TO DO RIGHT NOW AT THE GROCERY STORE TO HELP YOUR OWN BODY NATURALLY GET TO SLEEP.
I GUESS I NEED TO STOCK UP ON CHERRIES.
YOU BEEN HAVING TROUBLE SHE ALSO MENTIONED TO ME YOGURT.
YOU MAKE A SMOOTHIE AND INCLUDE ALL OF THIS YOGA CHERRIES WALNUTS YOU CAN SORT OF MAKE A SLEEPY TIME SMOOTHIE.
SO IF YOU THINK MAY BE RIGHT WHEN YOU ARE FEELING IT YOU CAN GET IN THE MOOD TO SLEEP.
