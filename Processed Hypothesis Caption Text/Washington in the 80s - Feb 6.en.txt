 THE 80S A TIME OF DIFFERING MEMORIES.
THE 80s WERE THE TIME OF MY LIFE.
JUST SURVIVIN IN ININ THIS STATE LIKE COMPLETE NOTHINGNESS.
IN THIS STATE LIKE COMPLETE NOTHINGNESS.
DIVERGENT MUSIC.
WE JUST DID ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.
WE WERE JUST CRAZY.
ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU CANT MOVE TO GOGO YOU WASNT MEANT TO MOVE.
COME ON!
DEVELOPMENT.
WASHINGTON WAS EMERGING AS THE GREAT COSMOPOLITAN WORLD CAPITAL.
DEFENDING CHAMPIONSHIPS.
GOOD HOLE!
I WENT FROM BEING PRETTY SMART TO THE NEXT DAY IM A BUFFOON.
AND DEATH.
WED HAVE SHOOTINGS BUT YOU HAD OVERDOSE DEATHS.
I PERSONALLY HAD A HUGE NUMBER OF FRIENDS THAT I LOST.
AND A MAYOR WHO DEFINED THE CITY.
THAT LITTLE WHITE POWDER IS SO POWERFUL.
HE WAS THE SUN AROUND WHICH WE ALL ORBITED.
JOIN US AS WE TRAVEL BACK IN TIME TO WASHINGTON IN THE 80s.
HIPHOP PLAYING  THE WAY SHE SHOOK HER BOOTY SURE LOOK GOOD TO ME  WASHINGTON AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 80s STILL REBUILDING AFTER THE 68 RIOTS.
I THINK THE RESIDENTS WERE FEELING HOPEFUL.
WE HAD A NEW MAYOR.
AND SO I THINK IT WAS A GOOD FEELING.
WE WERE ALL JUST COMIN OFF OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA AND SO THE COMMUNITY WAS BUILDING AND COEXISTING.
WED JUST HAD HOME RULE FOR A FEW YEARS AND IT JUST SOUNDED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE GREAT.
OF COURSE IT WASNT.
WASHINGTON D.C. WAS STILL A CITY DIVIDED.
ONE BLACK CITY AND ONE WHITE CITY.
ONE CITY IN POVERTY AND ONE CITY DOING WELL.
MIDDLECLASS WHITE FLIGHT MEANT THE 172000 WHITE RESIDENTS WHO REMAINED TENDED TO BE ABOVE AVERAGE INCOME AND LIVE IN THE CITYS LEAFIER NORTHWEST SUBURBS.
THERE WERE THE WHITE WARDS THAT WERE QUOTE UNQUOTE RECEIVED ANYTHING THEY WANT.
AND THERE WAS THE OTHER WARDS THE FORGOTTEN WARDS THAT WERE SORT OF OUT THERE HANGING OUT.
AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO MADE UP 70 OF THE CITYS RESIDENTS TENDED TO LIVE AND WORK IN THE POORER EASTERN QUADRANTS OF THE CITY AND CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN.
 AH ITS BECOMING LIKE A GHOST TOWN  WHEN YOU DROVE DOWNTOWN WITH YOUR PARENTS WHO MADE SURE THE DOORS WERE LOCKED YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS BOARDED UP.
DOWNTOWN WAS A LOT OF CRIME.
IT WAS A SCARY PLACE.
THERE WAS SOME HOPE THAT THAT WOULD CHANGE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING YET THAT GAVE AN INDICATION THAT CHANGE WAS REALLY COMING.
THE FEDERAL CITYS MOST PROMINENT RESIDENT FOUND HIMSELF IN A SIMILAR STATE OF STAGNATION.
IT IS A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE.
OUR HOSTAGES HAD BEEN TAKEN IN IRAN WE HAD 21 INTEREST RATES 13 INFLATION.
WASHINGTON WAS AS IT IS NOW A PREDOMINANTLY DEMOCRATIC TOWN.
SO WASHINGTON WANTED THIS PRESIDENT TO SUCCEED.
THE REST OF AMERICA DID NOT FEEL THE SAME.
NBC NEWS NOW MAKES ITS PROJECTION.
REAGAN IS OUR PROJECTED WINNER.
 ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST  CHEERING  ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST AND ANOTHER ONE GONE...  I RONALD REAGAN DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR... THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE OFFICE OF... TWO MONTHS LATER JUST AS REPUBLICAN RONALD REAGAN TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI OF IRAN RELEASED ALL 52 HOSTAGES.
I AM CONVINCED THEY SUSPECTED THAT RONALD REAGAN WOULD GIVE THEM 48 HOURS AND IF THE HOSTAGES WERENT ON THEIR WAY HOME THERE WOULD BE MILITARY ACTION.
CHEERING THOUGH WASHINGTONIANS WERE EXCITED TO WELCOME THE HOSTAGES MOST DIDNT FEEL THE SAME ABOUT THE NEW PRESIDENT.
DEPRESSED WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF DESCRIBING THE FACT THAT RONALD REAGAN WAS BRINGING WITH HIM A WHOLE NEW POLITICAL CULTURE.
THERE WERE FUR COATS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THERE WAS A PERCEPTION THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATIVES THAT CAME WERE A PRETTY RICH CROWD AND NOT VERY MUCH IN TOUCH WITH THE AVERAGE FOLKS.
I THINK THE GAY COMMUNITY AT THAT TIME HAD AN UNDERSTANDABLE AMOUNT OF TREPIDATION YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THIS PRESIDENT GOING TO BE LIKE.
I GAVE REAGAN ALL THE ATTENTION HE DESERVED.
HE WAS NOT A FRIEND OF THE CITY.
OTHERS WERE MORE WELCOMING.
THE PRESIDENT ELECT SAID THERES A ONE WORD DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRESIDENT AND RESIDENT.
AND HE WANTED TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN RESIDENT AND PRESIDENT.
AND I BELIEVE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IM THE MAYOR OF THE CITY AND HES GONNA BE ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS.
I THINK HE KNEW MORE ABOUT HOW WASHINGTON FUNCTIONED THAN A LOT OF OTHER PRESIDENTS.
HE WAS THE ONLY PRESIDENT THAT IVE KNOWN WHO ACTUALLY INVITED THE LOCAL MEDIA TO MEET WITH HIM.
WHEN REAGAN CAME TO TOWN THAT ARTS BEAT AND ENTERTAINMENT BEAT JUST EXPLODED BECAUSE REAGAN BROUGHT ALL OF HIS SHOWBIZ CONNECTIONS TO TOWN.
WHEN THEY HAD HIS FIRST INAUGURATION THEY HAD THIS HUGE EVENT.
RAY CHARLES SINGING INDISTINCTLY AND REAGAN SET THE TONE FOR MOVIES AND SHOW BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON WAS EMERGING AS THE GREAT COSMOPOLITAN WORLD CAPITAL IT IS TODAY.
IT WAS A GREAT TIME IN AMERICA AND IT WAS A GREAT FOR THE REAGANAUTS.
UNTIL MARCH 30 1981.
GUNSHOTS AS REAGAN WAS LEAVING THE WASHINGTON HILTON JOHN HINCKLEY JR.
FIRED 6 TIMES.
GET HIM OUT!
ONE SHOT HIT PRESS SECRETARY JAMES BRADY CRITICALLY WOUNDING HIM.
ANOTHER RICOCHETED OFF THE PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE LODGING IN REAGANS LUNG.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN YOU GET HOME?
SIT DOWN.
CHEERING WITHIN A MONTH REAGAN WAS BACK AT WORK.
AND THE WASHINGTON HILTON HAD A NICKNAME.
MEET ME OVER THERE.
OVER THERE BY THE HILTON THE HINCKLEY HILTON.
THE HINCKLEY HILTON.
I DONT THINK IVE EVER DRIVEN BY THAT HOTEL WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT.
BACK AT HIS DESK THE PRESIDENT WORKED WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION TO FULFILL HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO CUT SPENDING.
GROWING DISCONTENT WITH EXISTING TREATMENTS PROMPTED CUTS IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.
YOU BEGAN TO SEE LARGE NUMBERS OF PANHANDLERS APPEARING ON THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON.
TO BE IN D.C. WHERE THE PRESIDENTS RESIDES YOU WOULD THINKING WE SHOULDNT HAVE SOME PLACES LIKE THIS.
I WALK THE STREET AND I SLEEP ON THE ...DAMN STREET.
MANY DISTRICT HOMELESS WERE VETERANS DAMAGED BY THEIR EXPERIENCES IN VIETNAM FIGHTING AN UNPOPULAR WAR.
 I WANT TO GO WHERE LOVE IS I WANT YOU SHOW ME  I DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO GO.
I WANTED TO GO.
EVERYTHING I PUT MY HEART INTO YOU COME BACK AND YOU GOT DUMPED ON.
 I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME  IN 1980 CONGRESS AUTHORIZED CONSTRUCTION OF A VIETNAM MEMORIAL ON THE MALL.
FOLLOWING A NATIONWIDE COMPETITION A DESIGN FOR A SUNKEN REFLECTIVE BLACK GRANITE WALL BY MAYA LIN A 21YEAROLD COLLEGE STUDENT WAS SELECTED.
IT WAS SO SIMPLE AND SO DIRECT THAT IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN.
I SAID YOU KNOW THIS DOESNT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING HONORING THESE PEOPLES SERVICE AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS CULTURAL ARTISTIC DEBATE THAT WENT ON IN THIS TOWN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT ARE THEY DISHONORING THE VETS BY DOING THIS?
EVENTUALLY THE DESIGN FOR THE MEMORIAL WAS AMENDED AND 3 SOLDIERS WERE ADDED.
BUT ON ITS OPENING IN 1982 THE STRENGTH OF THE ORIGINAL DESIGN BECAME EVIDENT.
IM HERE TO PAY EULOGY AND HOMAGE TO ALL MY COMRADES WHO DIDNT MAKE IT BACK WITH ME.
I THINK THEY WANTED SOMETHING MORE HEROIC.
BUT I THINK THEY GOT SOMETHING THAT WAS EVEN MORE PROFOUND.
I THINK WHAT TURNED IT AROUND WAS NOT THE BLACK WALLS ITS THE NAMES ON THE WALLS.
AND I WILL SAY THAT IT TURNED OUT FROM THE WAY THAT THINGS BEEN RECEIVED THAT I WAS WRONG ON THAT ONE.
WRONG BIG TIME.
AND I LOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR BEING HERE.
AND JUST SAYING THANK YOU BECAUSE THATS ALL WE WANTED IS TO HEAR THAT.
FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY THE CITY HAD SUPPORTED TWO NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED DAILY NEWSPAPERS NEWSPAPERSTHE MORE PROGRESSIVE WASHINGTON POST AND MORE CONSERVATIVE THE MORE PROGRESSIVE WASHINGTON POST AND MORE CONSERVATIVE WASHINGTON STAR.
FREEZE FRAME PLAYING BUT THE RECESSION AND SHRINKING DEMAND FOR EVENING DAILIES FORCED THE STAR INTO BANKRUPTCY IN 1981.
TV KILLED THEM.
PEOPLE WATCH THE TV NEWS GO HOME AND THEY DONT SIT THERE AND READ THEIR PAPER.
CLICK.
FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF WE WERE A ONEPAPER TOWN.
AND THAT WAS I FELT A LITTLE DANGEROUS.
BUT IN A SIGN OF THE GROWING CLOUT OF CONSERVATIVE VOICES AN UPSTART DAILY WITH AN UNWAVERING POINT OF VIEW HIT THE NEWSSTANDS IN 1982.
ITS CALLED THE WASHINGTON TIMES AND ITS OWNED BY THE PUBLISHING ARM OF THE REVEREND MOONS UNIFICATION CHURCH.
I WASNT EXCITED TO SEE THE MOONEY PAPER COME AROUND NO.
WELL REVEREND MOON WAS A AA GREAT CHRISTIAN EVANGELIST FROM KOREA.
A GREAT CHRISTIAN EVANGELIST FROM KOREA.
HE OBVIOUSLY FELT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A GOOD MOUTHPIECE IN WASHINGTON.
MY COLUMN USED TO APPEAR IN THE WASHINGTON TIMES ON A REGULAR YOU KNOW TWICE A WEEK AND EVERY CONSERVATIVE READ IT.
I MEAN IT WAS SOMETHING WE HAD THAT WE HAD NEVER HAD BEFORE.
NO ONE WHO WORKED THE NEWS ROOMS OF WASHINGTON IN THE 80s CAN FORGET JANUARY 13 1982.
I HAD JUST COME ACROSS THE BRIDGE IN A BLINDING SNOWSTORM AND WHEN I GOT LIKE 10 FEET OFF THE BRIDGE WE HEARD A CRUNCH.
AT 401 P.M. AIR FLORIDA FLIGHT 90 CRASHED INTO THE 14th STREET BRIDGE.
AND WE GET DOWN THERE AND WE DONT REALLY HAVE A METHOD FOR DEALING WITH THAT KIND OF MASS CAUSALITY.
THE RADIO SYSTEMS DIDNT FUNCTION LIKE THEY SHOULD.
WE DIDNT HAVE ANYPLACE TO DEAL WITH THE BODIES.
PASSERBY LENNY SKUTNIK DOVE INTO THE WATER TO HELP SAVE A DROWNING WOMAN.
WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THAT WOMAN FIGHTING TO SURVIVE IN THE ICY POTOMAC THAT WOMAN FIGHTING TO SURVIVE IN THE ICY POTOMAC WAS ONE OF THE STEWARDESSES ON BOARD THE PLANE HER NAME KELLY DUNCAN.
HE REALLY SYMBOLIZED I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO HELP AND WERE WILLING TO HELP EACH OTHER.
74 PEOPLE ON THE PLANE AND 4 ON THE BRIDGE WERE KILLED.
ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WAS ON THAT PLANE.
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF 3 YOUNG CHILDREN.
AND I MISS HER TO THIS DAY.
AS WORD OF THE CRASH SPREAD AND THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORP DESCENDED ON THE SCENE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT ANOTHER TRAGEDY HAD STRUCK THE REGION.
REPORTERS COULDNT GET THERE BECAUSE THE METRO TRAIN ALSO HAD DERAILED.
30 MINUTES AFTER THE PLANE CRASH AN ORANGE LINE TRAIN JUMPED THE TRACKS IN A TUNNEL NEAR FEDERAL TRIANGLE.
TWO WOMEN AND A MAN WHOSE NAMES HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED WERE BEEN KILLED.
THAT FORCED THE REGION TO THINK OH MY GOODNESS WHAT DO WE DO IF... BY 1982 BARRYS FIRST TERM AS MAYOR WAS COMING TO A CLOSE.
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS ELECTION IN 1978 VOTERS WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO JUDGE HIS RECORD.
HE WAS ELECTED BY WHITES BECAUSE HE WON ESSENTIALLY WITH THE VOTES OF PEOPLE IN WARDS ONE TWO 3 AND 6.
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WERE GOING TO DO HERE.
BUT ONCE IN POWER BARRY KNEW THAT TYING HIS POLITICAL FUTURE TO THE CITYS WHITE RESIDENTS WAS UNSUSTAINABLE.
HE MADE AN INCREDIBLY PRUDENT POLITICAL DECISION TO SWITCH HIS BASE TO BLACK THROUGH THE MINORITY CONTRACTING PROGRAMS AND BRINGING BLACK FOLKS INTO KEY POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT.
I CAN REMEMBER HIM SAYING LISTEN YOURE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE YOU GOT TO GET PREPARED FOR LEADERSHIP AND FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME I GOT TO BE CHIEF BECAUSE OF BARRY.
BARRY USED THE POWER OF HIS POSITION TO ENCOURAGE THE CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF AFRICANAMERICAN OWNED BUSINESSES.
AND IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO BUSINESS IN D.C. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THEYD ASK YOU DO YOU HAVE MINORITY PARTICIPATION IN THIS DEAL?
WHAT CAME ABOUT WAS SORT OF A PHILOSOPHY THAT WHITE BUSINESSES SHOULD PARTNER UP WITH QUALIFIED AFRICANAMERICAN BUSINESS PEOPLE AND ONCE YOU GET A BLACK CITY COUNCIL ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WHITE LAW FIRMS STARTS SAYING WERE GOING TO HAVE BLACK PARTNERS.
AND SOME OF THE WHITE BUSINESSES STARTED SAYING WE HAVE TO HAVE BLACK LOBBYISTS.
THE INCREASED FLOW OF MONEY MOVING THROUGH THE CITYS ECONOMY SWELLED THE DISTRICTS COFFERS GIVING BARRY THE INCOME TO SPEND ON PROJECTS THAT BENEFITED THE CITYS POORER YOUTH AND BUILD A BASE FOR THE REST OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER.
MY MOST MEMORABLE PROGRAM IS THE SUMMER JOB PROGRAM.
OVER 100000 YOUNG PEOPLE WENT THROUGH OUR SUMMER JOB PROGRAM.
I WAS JUST AT SOME EVENT AND THE GUY WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE PEOPLE PARKING THE CARS CAME UP TO ME HE SAYS I GOT MY FIRST JOB IN THE MARION BARRY SUMMER JOBS PROGRAM.
AND HE SAID NOW I HELP RUN THIS COMPANY.
THAT WAS THE BOMB.
YOU GO DOWN 500 C STREET AND THERES A LONG LINE OF KIDS WAITING IN LINE TO GET THEIR CHECKS YOU KNOW SO YOU WOULD SEE THEM ALL DOWNTOWN AT THE GOGO AT NIGHT YOU KNOW.
SO THAT WAS AWESOME YES INDEED.
RECOGNIZING THE DISTRICTS AGING WERE UNDERSERVED BARRY ALSO INVESTED HEAVILY IN SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY.
AND THE FLIPSIDE OF THAT FOR BARRY WAS AND IN ADDITION TO THAT BEING A GOOD THING WAS THAT HE WOULD TAKE BUSES RECREATION BUSES AND TAKE THEM ALL DOWN TO VOTE.
MUSIC PLAYING IN 1982 BARRY WAS ELECTED TO A SECOND TERM AS MAYOR WITH 81 OF THE VOTE I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR REAFFIRMING YOUR FAITH IN ME.
CHEERING SO IT WAS CLEAR THAT HIS SUCCESS IN THE ELECTION HAD BEEN LARGELY THROUGH BLACK FOLKS AND NOT FROM THE WHITE COMMUNITY.
HE SAID GET OVER IT.
DURING HIS FIRST TERM BARRY HAD HONORED PROMISES MADE TO THE GAY COMMUNITY A CORE CONSTITUENCY THAT HELPED TO ELECT HIM.
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WERE A POLITICAL POWER.
JUST HIS WILLINGNESS TO SAY I WILL HAVE OPENLY GAY PEOPLE IN MY ADMINISTRATION.
NOBODY DID THAT AT THAT TIME.
SO THAT WAS HUGE.
BARRYS ACTIONS HELPED TO ESTABLISH D.C. AS ONE OF THE COUNTRYS MOST GAY FRIENDLY CITIES.
IT AFFECTED MOST GAY PEOPLES SOCIAL LIVES IN THAT THEY BECAME MORE OPEN.
IT GAVE THE COMMUNITY THIS ENORMOUS NUMBER OF HEALTHY HAPPY WAYS OF MEETING PEOPLE.
AND SO IT MADE IT A LOT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO COME OUT.
MUSIC PLAYING BY 1984 EXPANSION OF D.C.s ANNUAL GAY PRIDE DAY TO A WEEKLONG FESTIVAL WAS COMPLETE CEMENTING WASHINGTONS STATUS AS HOME TO ONE THE COUNTRYS LARGEST AND MOST VIBRANT GAY COMMUNITIES.
IMPROVEMENT IN THE CITYS FORTUNES ALSO SPREAD TO THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
CHEERING IN 1981 TEAM OWNER JACK KENT COOKE FIRED COACH JACK PARDEE AND REPLACED HIM WITH SAN DIEGO OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR JOE GIBBS.
AT FIRST I SAID IF IM NOT SUCCESSFUL HEY THATS PART OF LIFE.
BUT WHEN I GOT THERE WHAT I REALIZED WAS HOW MANY PEOPLE DEPEND ON YOU.
THE TEAM BEGAN THE SEASON 0 AND 5.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE THE FIRST GUY TO EVER COACH IN THE NFL AND NEVER WIN A GAME.
I TOLD PAT PLEASE SELL THE DOG ID HATE TO COME HOME AND SEE THAT FELLOW DRAPED OVER THE STEPS.
BUT A THIRD OF A WAY THROUGH THE 81 SEASON WINS REPLACED LOSSES AND THE TEAM FINISHED THEY HAD A REALLY UNIQUE SQUAD.
THEY HAD A REALLY UNIQUE SQUAD.
THEISMANN WAS JUST REALLY SLICK.
JOE T. WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PASSIONATE FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
I MEAN THAT GUY WANTED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
RIGGINS WAS A BULL.
AND THEN YOU HAD A JOE WASHINGTON WHO WAS JUST THIS SMALL SPEEDY GUY.
ART MONK ANYTHING YOU THREW UP HE CAUGHT.
THE HOGS WERE BIG AND FAT.
AND THEYTHEY PUT UP A LOT OF MEAT AGAINST THAT LINE.
CROWD CHANTING WE WANT DALLAS AFTER GOING 81 AND FIRST IN THE NFC EAST IN THE STRIKE STRIKESHORTENED 1982 SEASON THEY HOSTED THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME SHORTENED 1982 SEASON THEY HOSTED THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST THEIR FIERCEST RIVAL.
THE EXCITEMENT OF RFK YOU HEARD OUTSIDE THE STADIUM JUST UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU JUST CAN HEAR THAT ROARING CROWD.
THE HOME TEAM WAS LEADING 2417 WITH LESS THAN 7 MINUTES REMAINING.
PLAY ACTION FAKED TO DORSET.
SCREEN PASS BATTED IN THE AIR BY MANLEY.
DARRYL GRANTS THERE PICKED IT OFF.
TOUCHDOWN WASHINGTON REDSKINS!
UNBELIEVABLE!
THE STADIUM WOULD ROCK.
IT WAS THUNDEROUS.
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT.
WITH THAT WIN THE TEAM HEADED TO PASADENA TO PLAY THE MIAMI DOLPHINS IN SUPER BOWL XVII.
THE GAME WAS CLOSE THROUGHOUT.
IT CAME DOWN TO THE FOURTH QUARTER.
I THINK WE WERE ON THE PLUS 41 YARD LINE AND IT WAS FOURTH AND ONE AND I MADE THE CALL TO GO FOR IT .
HERE GOES THE DIESEL.
THERES THE SNAP TO THEISMANN HAND TO RIGGINS.
HES GOT A GOOD HOLE.
HES GOT THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 40.
HES GONE!
THE 35 THE 30 THE 20!
HES GONE!
TOUCHDOWN WASHINGTON REDSKINS!
HES GONE!
TOUCHDOWN WASHINGTON REDSKINS!
HOLY COW WAS THAT A PLAY OR WHAT?
THE FINAL SCORE 2717 WASHINGTON.
WOO!
REDSKINS ARE NUMBER ONE!
EVERYBODY POURED INTO THE STREETS OF M STREET IN GEORGETOWN.
IT WAS EUPHORIC.
THE CITYS TEAM FINALLY BROUGHT HOME THE BACON.
WOO!
GOGO MUSIC PLAYING FOOTBALL WASNT THE ONLY THING MAKING FANS AT RFK CHEER.
THE BACKTOSCHOOL BOOGIE THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS.
YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE ALL THESE GOGO BANDS PERFORM INSIDE OF A HUGE STADIUM.
IM OUT HERE WITH FAMILY!
I USED TO ALWAYS SAY IF YOU CANT MOVE TO GOGO YOU WASNT MEANT TO MOVE.
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME HEARING TROUBLE FUNK.
THERES A SONG TO PUMP ME UP.
PUMP PUMP PUMP PUMP ME UP  AND HENRY ROLLINS WHO WAS MY PUMP ME UP  AND HENRY ROLLINS WHO WAS MY BEST FRIEND WE HEARD IT ON THE RADIO AND WE JUST PULLED THE CAR OVER TO LISTEN TO THE SONG.
IN ADDITION TO CHUCK BROWN AND TROUBLE FUNK BANDS SUCH AS RARE ESSENCE AND EU CREATED A MUSIC AND CULTURE PROUD OF ITS D.C.
ROOTS.
...ALL RIGHT.
GOGO WAS A PRODUCT OF A TIME WHEN D.C. PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD MORE MUSIC PROGRAMS.
KIDS COULDNT AFFORD TO BUY INSTRUMENTS.
AND SO THE KIDS WOULD CHECK OUT THEIR INSTRUMENTS AND THEYD GO HOME TO PRACTICE ALL RIGHT BUT WITH THE LOCAL GOGO BAND.
LIVE RECORDINGS BETTER KNOWN AS P.A.
TAPES BECAME A FORM OF CURRENCY FOR GOGO FANS.
WE USED TO GO TO THE GOGOS WITH OUR BIG BOOM BOXES AND ANDAND STAND IN FRONT OF THE SPEAKERS.
AND STAND IN FRONT OF THE SPEAKERS.
IT WAS AND IT STILL IS A BIG THING TO GET YOUR NAME CALLED OUT ESPECIALLY IF YOUR NAME IS ALWAYS HEARD ON THE P.A.
TAPES.
YOU KNOW.
WHOO THAT WAS A BIG FEELING.
AND SO YOU WANTED THAT P.A.
TAPE FROM THIS DAY.
THE CITYS INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR LIVE GOGO LED TO PERFORMANCES SPRINGING UP ALL OVER TOWN.
EVERYBODY REPRESENTED WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
YOU KNOW JUNK YARD FROM BARRY FARMS.
PETWORTH NAMED ITSELF AFTER THE AREA.
MY FIRSTEVER EXPERIENCE PLAYIN LIVE WITH A GOGO BAND WAS IN MY FRIENDS BACKYARD AND PEOPLE WOULD CROWD AROUND AND LISTEN TO US.
A COMPULSION TO PLAY LIVE MUSIC THAT LED TO AN UNLIKELY SHARING OF STAGES.
A LOT OF THE REGULAR CLUBS LIKE AT THE BAYOU AND YOU KNOW DESPERADOES ONLY BOOKED YOU KNOW BIG ROCK BANDS OR BIG NAME PEOPLE SO WE WOULD PLAY ANYWHERE.
AND IT ENDED UP THAT WE WOULD PLAY TOGETHER.
CLASHS SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO PLAYING ONE OF THESE CROSSOVER VENUES WAS AT 930 F STREET NORTHWEST.
THEIR SLOGAN WAS A PLACE AND A TIME.
WHEN ORIGINAL OWNERS DODY DiSANTO AND JON BOWERS OPENED THE 930 CLUB IN 1980 THEIR CHOICE OF LOCATION IN THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN WAS UNCONVENTIONAL.
WHEN THE 930 WAS THERE THERE WERE PEEP SHOWS AND YOU KNOW LIQUOR STORES AND STRIP JOINTS.
PEOPLE COULDNT AFFORD TO BUY EXPENSIVE REAL ESTATE SO THEY HAD TO DO IT IN THE BAD PARTS OF TOWN.
THE TINY ODDSHAPED SPACE WAS AN ACQUIRED TASTE.
THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH ROOM FOR THE AUDIENCE.
IT WAS LIKE YOU WERE IN A LOBBY.
WE WOULD HAVE BANDS SHOW UP WHO WERE APPALLED AND ASK...SO WHERES THE CLUB?
AND SOME BANDS WALKED OUT.
DJ JAZZY JEFF AND THE FRESH PRINCE WILL SMITH WALKED OUT.
TWO SOLDOUT SHOWS.
OF COURSE WHEN THE BAND DID GO ON YOU WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.
THERE WAS NO CLOSER EXPERIENCE TO SEE A SHOW THAN THE OLD 930 CLUB.
A UNIQUE VENUE THAT BECAME A FAVORITE OF THE LOCAL HARDCORE PUNK SCENE DEFINED BY ITS INCLUSION OF ANYONE WHO DIDNT FEEL THEY BELONGED.
IF YOU GREW UP IN THIS TOWN I THINK YOU FEEL REALLY MARGINALIZED FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER.
D.C.
PUNK GAVE BIRTH TO BANDS LIKE GOVERNMENT ISSUE STATE OF ALERT AND MINOR THREAT WITH IAN MACKAYE ON LEAD VOCALS.
SINGING INDISTINCTLY  WE IDENTIFIED AS WASHINGTON D.C. AND IT WAS A CHIP ON OUR SHOULDER.
THE REGION ALSO PRODUCED THE GROUNDBREAKING BAD BRAINS.
SINGING INDISTINCTLY THE BAD BRAINS WERE 4 GUYS FROM ANACOSTIA AND PG COUNTY AND THEY WERE JUST AN INCREDIBLE BAND.
 THEYRE PLAYING BASKETBALL  THE EARLY 80s SAW AN EXPLOSION IN THE POPULARITY OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY BASKETBALL.
 ...BASKETBALL  I CAN REMEMBER WHEN GEORGETOWN WAS JUST A TYPE OF IVY LEAGUE JESUIT SCHOOL BUT THEN JOHN THOMPSON CAME AND TURNED IT AROUND AND EVERYONE WAS HOYAS HOYAS HOYAS.
THE TEAMS TOUGH HOYAS HOYAS.
THE TEAMS TOUGH DEFENSEMINDED STYLE HELPED TO ATTRACT A STRONG LOCAL FOLLOWING.
A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK BASKETBALL TEAM AT ATAT A REALLY GOOD UNIVERSITY THAT INSPIRED A LOT OF US.
AT A REALLY GOOD UNIVERSITY THAT INSPIRED A LOT OF US.
WE HUNG OUT IN GEORGETOWN.
WE WORE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY SWEATSHIRTS.
IT WAS LIKE A PARTY TO ME.
IT WAS THE PLACE TO BE.
THE ENERGY WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
IN MARCH OF 1982 THE HOYAS LED BY CENTER PATRICK EWING ADVANCED TO THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
WITH LESS THAN 10 SECONDS LEFT THEY HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE THE WINNING SHOT.
FRED BROWN WITH THE BALL.
OH HE THROWS IT TO THE WRONG GUY.
I HAD TO TURN THE TV OFF.
I COULDNT STAND TO WATCH ANYMORE.
TWO SEASONS LATER THE TEAM WENT 343 WINNING THE BIG EAST CHAMPIONSHIP.
 THEYRE PLAYING BASKETBALL  THEY ADVANCED THROUGH THE NCAA REGIONAL THE FINAL FOUR TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST HOUSTON.
MICHAEL GRAHAM JUST GOES UP AND TOMAHAWK DUNKS IT AND HE LOOKS AT PAT AND HE JUST POINTS AT HIM JUST TO LET HIM KNOW OK WEWE GOT THIS.
WOO!
GEORGETOWN WINS THE TITLE AND FRED BROWN GETS THE HUG.
THE HOYAS WERE WELCOMED BACK WASHINGTON AS CHAMPIONS AND COACH THOMPSON AS A HERO.
AND I THINK ALL OF US FEEL A GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT YOUVE ACCOMPLISHED.
AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CAMPAIGNED FOR REELECTION IN 1984 MITCH SNYDER THE LEADER OF HOMELESS ADVOCACY GROUP COMMUNITY FOR CREATIVE NONVIOLENCE OR CCNV STAGED A HUNGER STRIKE TO DEMAND THE ADMINISTRATION RENOVATE A SHELTER IN AN ABANDONED FEDERAL BUILDING.
THE ADMINISTRATIONS SAYING AND EVERYBODYS NAME INCLUDING OURS IT HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THE POOREST OF THE POOR.
MY SISTERINLAW FOR A VERY BRIEF TIME WAS UH IN HUD DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS.
AND SHE WANTED TO GO AND INTERVIEW MITCH SNYDER.
AND ESSENTIALLY THE ADMINISTRATION SAID DONT DO IT.
AND DONT DO ANYTHING.
 AND I NEED TO BE LOVED JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES  51 DAYS INTO HIS PROTEST SNYDER GOT HIS WISH.
I THINK WE CAPITULATED TO SOME DEGREE.
TRUTH BE TOLD REAGAN WAS A SENSITIVEI MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD AFFECT HIM.
TWO DAYS LATER PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS REELECTED.
YOU AINT SEEN NOTHING YET.
I HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS THAT SEEMED TO HAVE THIS CONTINUAL FLU BUG.
AND THEN IT BECAME PNEUMONIA AND THEN THEY JUST DIED.
AS REAGAN BEGAN HIS SECOND TERM A LACK OF ACTION TOWARDS THOSE SUFFERING AND DYING FROM HIV INFECTION PERSISTED.
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS CONFIRMED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER TALKED TO HIS SURGEON GENERAL ABOUT AIDS.
THOSE IN THE DISTRICT TURNED TO THE WASHINGTON BLADE FOR INFORMATION.
THE COMMUNITY DESPERATELY NEEDED INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISEASE.
ON APRIL 4 1983 THE WHITMANWALKER CLINIC HELD D.C.s FIRST PUBLIC FORUM ON THE EPIDEMIC.
WHITMAN WALKER WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF AIDS INFORMATION BUT THEY ALSO HELPED HOUSE PEOPLE.
THEY HELPED TO FEED PEOPLE.
THEY HAD TO ACTUALLY STEP IN AND BECOME INVOLVED IN THE LINK BETWEEN THE DOCTORS AND THE HOSPITALS AND THE PATIENTS.
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE BEING TURNED AWAY FROM HOSPITALS.
 THERES JUST NO CAUSE THERES JUST NO CAUSE...  BUT THE DEATHS OF TWO PUBLIC FIGURES WITH TIES TO WASHINGTON FORCED THE COUNTRY AND THE PRESIDENT TO ACT.
ROCK HUDSON WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD ONE PARTICULAR VERY INFLUENTIAL FRIEND IN WASHINGTONELIZABETH TAYLOR.
NOT ONLY WAS SHE AN ICON OF THE MOVIES SHE WAS ALSO MARRIED TO A U.S.
SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA JOHN WARNER.
AND SO MINDS WERE CHANGED AND THE PERCEPTION BEGAN TO SHIFT.
...THAT SCIENCE WILL CONTINUE TO FIND THE CRITICAL ANSWERS.
JERRY SMITH MY FAVORITE TIGHT END FOR THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS WHEN HE WAS STRICKEN WITH AIDS IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THIS HEMAN WAS GAY.
RONALD REAGANS OPINION DEFINITELY CHANGED BECAUSE THESE WERE YOUR FRIENDS DYING.
SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.
GAY RIGHTS!
NOW!
GAY RIGHTS!
NOW!
A YEAR AFTER JERRY SMITHS PASSING AN ESTIMATED HALF A MILLION PEOPLE DESCENDED ON WASHINGTON FOR THE SECOND MARCH FOR GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS.
 EVERY ONE YOU MEET EVERY STEP YOU TAKE...  THE HIGHLIGHT A MASSIVE MEMORIAL QUILT COVERING THE MALL WITH THE NAMES OF THE THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO HAD DIED OF AIDS.
 ILL BE WATCHING YOU  AMERICA IS A QUILT MADE UP OF MANY PATCHES MANY PIECES MANY TEXTURES.
BUT EVERYBODY FITS!
EVERY ONE OF US WHO WERE THERE JUST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND EITHER CRIED OR SMILED OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO.
 ILL BE WATCHING YOU EVERY STEP YOU TAKE EVERY SMILE YOU...  YEAH  BY 1987 THE DECADES EARLY PROMISE WAS BEGINNING TO FADE.
 WERE ON THE ROAD TO NOWHERE COME ON INSIDE  ATTEMPTS TO GIVE THE DISTRICT CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION AND STATEHOOD HAD GONE NOWHERE.
MANY STARTED TO ASK IF BARRYS MANAGEMENT OF THE CITY WAS PART OF THE PROBLEM.
MARION BARRY WAS ALREADY STARTING TO HAVE SOME BUDGET PROBLEMS RUNNING SOME DEFICITS.
BUT HE DIDNT CUT HIS CRONY CONTRACTS HE DIDNT CUT WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE.
WHAT HE CUT WAS 1500 POLICE OFFICERS.
MAYOR BARRYS LIFESTYLE ALSO RAISED QUESTIONS.
KAREN JOHNSON JUST TOLD AUTHORITIES THAT SHE SOLD THE MAYOR COCAINE 2030 TIMES FROM LATE 1980 TO 1982.
HE WAS NOTORIOUS FOR STAYING OUT LATE WITH WOMEN WHO WERE NOT HIS WIFE.
THIS IS WHEN HE WOULD USE THE SECURITY DETAIL TO PROCURE A WOMAN FOR HIM.
MAYOR MARION BARRY TONIGHT ANGRILY DENIED THAT HE HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED AFTER OVERDOSING ON COCAINE.
MARION BARRY BECAME TOO COMFORTABLE WITH POWER.
AFTER HE WON OVER THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE AFRICANAMERICAN POPULATION HE FELT HE COULD NO LONGER BE REMOVED.
HE WAS POWERFUL.
HE COULD MAKE A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR WARD.
HEY DO YOU WANT THAT NEW FIRE STATION?
DO YOU WANT THE LIBRARY?
GROWING DISCONTENT THAT LED BARRY TO HAVE REAL COMPETITION IN THE 86 MAYORAL ELECTION.
IN WASHINGTON D.C. WHERE THE VOTER REGISTRATION WAS 101 DEMOCRATS TO REPUBLICANS I GOT A THIRD OF THE VOTE.
THOUGH SCHWARTZS TALLY EXCEEDED EVERYONES EXPECTATIONS BARRYS BASE DELIVERED HIM A THIRD TERM WITH 61 OF THE VOTE.
THE WASHINGTON POST ENDORSED HIM 3 STRAIGHT TIMES I THINK WITH GROWING RELUCTANCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE THIRD TIME.
BUT THE ELECTORATE AND OPINION PAGES COOLING ON BARRY DID NOTHING TO SLOW HIS LARGER LARGERTHANLIFE PERSONA.
WHEN PEOPLE ELECTED ME THANLIFE PERSONA.
WHEN PEOPLE ELECTED ME THEY DIDNT ELECT ME POPE.
THEY ELECTED ME MAYOR.
IF I GO OUT AT NIGHT AT 900 OR 1000 WHATS THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
BECAUSE OF HIS SHORT ATTENTION SPAN HE COULD COMPARTMENTALIZE HE COULD COULDI MEAN HE WOULD GO OUT AT NIGHT WITH THE I MEAN HE WOULD GO OUT AT NIGHT WITH THE FAMOUS IM A NIGHT OWL.
AS IF THAT WOULDASH THINGS AWAY.
THE CITY PAPER DUBBED HIM MAYOR FOR LIFE.
WHEN YOU FOR THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE KNOW IT.
HES THE ONLY ONE I SEEN THAT STOOD THERE FOR US.
IF HE HADNT BEEN MAYOR BARRYS NIGHTLIFE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISING AS D.C.s BAR AND CLUB SCENE REACHED A PEAK IN THE MID 80s.
THERE WAS THIS CLUB CALLED THE FOX TRAPPE AND IT WAS THE PLACE TO GO FOR THE BUPPIES.
THAT WAS THE QUINTESSENTIAL PLACE WHERE HIGHINCOME SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE GO.
OUD DRESS UP TO GO THERE YOU DRESSED UP YOUR BEHAVIOR TOO AND YOUR MANNERS IN MOST CASES.
BECAUSE THE FOXTRAPPE WASNT JUST A NIGHTCLUB IT WAS A D.C. INSTITUTION WHERE MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CONGRESSIONAL CAUCUS RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH AFRICAN AFRICANAMERICAN BUSINESS LEADERS AND CELEBRITIES.
AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADERS AND CELEBRITIES.
MUSIC PLAYING THERE WAS ALWAYS AN INTERESTING EVENT GOING ON A LOT OF THEM WERE FUNDRAISERS.
A LOT OF THEM WERE WHAT WE WOULD CALL JUST NETWORKING EVENTS.
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG BLACK PROFESSIONALS TO FEEL A SENSE OF SOLIDARITY AND TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES.
AND IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO SOCIALIZE AND ALSO TO MEET NEW PEOPLE.
IT WAS NICE BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE PROCESS.
D.C.s SUPERDISCOS WERE ALSO EXPERIENCING UNPARALLELED POPULARITY.
THE PIER THE LOST AND FOUND THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS A BLAST.
IT WAS A FRICKIN HOOT!
INSANE.
REDSKINS CAME IN THEIR REDSKINS JERSEYS.
YOU COULD RUN INTO EXTREMELY FAMOUS PEOPLE AND THEY ALL MERGED TOGETHER.
A VIBRANT PARTY SCENE THAT BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE 80s RECREATIONAL DRUG OF CHOICE.
EVERYONE DID COCAINE.
IT WAS EVERYWHERE.
AND IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE LIKE A COCKTAIL.
YOU HAD A GLASS OF GIN YOU HAD A LINE OF COKE.
BUT AS PARTICIPATION WAS RELIANT ON A CERTAIN LIFESTYLE IT WAS SOMETHING MANY AVERAGE AMERICANS NEVER EXPERIENCED.
IT WAS A SUBCULTURE THAT I KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT AND IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT.
IN 1984 SOPHOMORE LEN BIAS FROM PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY LED THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND TO THE ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE TITLE BRINGING NATIONAL ATTENTION TO THE TEAM.
LEN BIAS SENIOR SEASON WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A WIN OVER THE TOP RANKED TARHEELS.
MARYLAND HAS KNOCKED OFF NORTH CAROLINA IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST UPSETS THIS YEAR AND THERE IS ONE HAPPY LEN BIAS.
YOU COULDNT STOP HIM.
HE HEHE HAD THE ATHLETICISM.
HE HAD THE DEFENSE.
ATHLETICISM.
HE HAD THE DEFENSE.
HE CAN REBOUND.
SKILLS THAT MADE HIM THE SECOND OVERALL PICK IN THE 1986 NBA DRAFT.
WE WERE JUST SO HAPPY AND IT WAS JUST A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL TIME.
HE COMES BACK TO MARYLAND AND I AM NOT AT HOME.
AND I NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.
 PAINT YOUR TOE SELL YOUR SOUL  INVESTIGATORS THIS MORNING ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED THE DEATH THURSDAY OF FORMER UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BASKETBALL STAR LEN BIAS.
THE AUTOPSY SHOWED THAT BIAS HAD DIED FROM A COCAINE OVERDOSE.
LIKE I SAID THERE WAS A SUBCULTURE THAT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT UNTIL MY SON DIED AND THEN BOOM YOU FIND OUT THIS IS REAL LIFE.
I LOVED YOU LEONARD AND ILL MISS YOU.
ILL SEE YOU IN HEAVEN ONE DAY.
AS COCAINE USE WAS PEAKING IN THE WASHINGTON REGION A NEW MORE POTENT SMOKABLE FORM OF THE DRUG BEGAN TO APPEAR.
THE FIRST TIME THAT WE MADE A SEIZURE OF CRACK WAS UP IN NORTHWEST AND FROM THEN ON IT WAS ON.
 OH YEAH  IT SEEMED LIKE SUDDENLY ONE DAY WE WOKE UP AND WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC.
AND THIS TIME IT WAS THE CREWS OF KIDS WHO HAD GROWN UP WITH MY OWN KIDS WHO WERE ON THE CORNER SELLING CRACK COCAINE BATTLING OVER TURF.
ONE MINUTE IT FELT LIKE WE WERE PUTTIN QUARTERS INTO THE SPACE INVADERS MACHINES TO YOU KNOW BEIN A DRUG DEALER.
YOU HAD TO SURVIVE SO YOU JOINED A GANG JUST TO AVOID BEING SUPPRESSED BY A GANG.
WHILE YOUNG AFRICANAMERICAN MEN BOTH PROFITED AND DIED DURING THE CRACK EPIDEMIC SOME OF ITS MOST TRAGIC VICTIMS WERE YOUNG WOMEN.
WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER I FANCIED MYSELF A PHOTOGRAPHER AND I HAD TAKEN PHOTOS OF YOUNG WOMEN IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN THEY WERE 7 8 YEARS OLD THE LIGHT IN THEIR EYES THE SMILES ON THEIR FACES.
AND TO SEE THOSE SAME YOUNG WOMEN PROSTITUTING HERSELF ON A CORNER IN HER OWN NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE EVERYBODY KNEW HER TO BUY CRACK COCAINE...
THROUGH IT ALL THE CITY AND POLICE DEPARTMENT SEEMED POWERLESS.
THE CLEAN SWEEP OPERATION WAS DESIGNED TO ATTACK THE CROWDS THAT WERE GATHERING TO BUY AND SELL DRUGS.
AND WE JUST ARRESTED PEOPLE IN THE HUNDREDS.
 ...ROCKET SHIP EXPLODES AND EVERYBODY SPILLS BLOOD  I WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT THEY GRABBED AND THREW DOWN AND THEY DIDNT TAKE ME STRAIGHT TO THE PRECINCT.
THEY HAD TO TAKE ME TO D.C. GENERAL HOSPITAL FIRST BECAUSE I WAS BEATEN UP PRETTY BADLY.
THERE WASNT ANY STUDY TO SAY DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?
IS THERE ANY LONGTERM IMPACT?
THE COURTS WOULD SAY WE CANT PROCESS 700 PEOPLE.
WED COME IN MAKE THE ARREST IN TWO WEEKS THEYRE BACK AND THEYRE DOING THE SAME THING.
WHILE THE HEADLINES WERE DOMINATED BY BAD NEWS THE POPULARITY AND PROFITABILITY OF LOCAL TV AND RADIO MADE IT AN EXCITING TIME FOR THE BUSINESS.
IT WAS THE GRAND AGE OF COMPETITION BETWEEN LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS AND LOCAL RADIO STATIONS.
YOU COULD EXPERIMENT PEOPLE WERE A LITTLE LESS SAFE.
EARLIER IN THE DECADE ICONIC RADIO STATION DC101 PUSHED THE EXPERIMENTAL ENVELOPE TO ITS LIMITS HIRING A YOUNG DJ NAMED HOWARD STERN TO HOST ITS MORNING SHOW.
EVERYBODY WOULD COME IN THAT DAY AND SAY DID YOU HEAR WHAT HOWARD STERN DID OR SAID THIS MORNING?
ONE TIME WHEN HIS WIFE HAD A MISCARRIAGE HE DID AN ENTIRE SHOW ON IT.
IF SOMEBODY DOESNT WANT TO LISTEN TO MY RADIO PROGRAM THEY SHOULD TURN THE DIAL AND LISTEN TO SOME OTHER JERK.
WHILE HOWARD STERN WAS THE MOST SHOCKING DJ IN TOWN DONNY SIMPSON WAS UNDISPUTED FAVORITE.
EVERY RADIO STATION WANTED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ATTRACT YOUNG WHITES AND YOUNG BLACKS AND DONNIE STARTED MIXING THOSE TWO KINDS OF MUSIC AND DONNIE WOULD SAY IM PLAYING A FUDGE RIPPLE.
HA HA!
 WE ALL KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE THE SAME WHEREVER YOU GO  DONNIE HAD THIS SMILE.
HE HAD THE LAUGH.
HE HAD THE BUBBLY EYES.
GOOD LOOKS AND A PERSONALITY MADE FOR A NEW NATIONAL TV NETWORK.
WHEN WE PUT DONNIE ON B.E.T.
AS THE HOST OF VIDEO SOUL...
IM DONNIE SIMPSON.
JOIN ME TONIGHT FOR VIDEO SOUL.
THATS TONIGHT VIDEO SOUL 9 P.M. EASTERN TIME RIGHT HERE ON B.E.T.
HE BECAME INSTANTLY OVERNIGHT A CELEBRITY AND B.E.T.
BEGAN TO BE DEFINED BY DONNIE SIMPSON AND VIDEO SOUL.
WELL BE BACK.
WE GOT A...
IT WAS NATIONAL AND SO IT ALLOWED US TO BROADEN OUR SCOPE ON WHO WE WERE AS A CULTURE.
WHILE CABLE TV WAS IN ITS INFANCY WASHINGTONS LOCAL AFFILIATES WERE AT THEIR HEIGHT.
HEY YOU WANT DEPTH?
WATCH CHANNEL 26.
THIS IS CHANNEL 4.
WE HAVE FUN HERE.
 SO GOOD TO TURN TO  CHANNEL 5 WASHINGTONS MOSTWATCHED STATION.
FROM WJLATV... AS RATINGS FOR LOCAL NEWS CREATED ADVERTISING DOLLARS THE BATTLE BETWEEN SPORTS DEPARTMENTS BECAME PARTICULARLY FIERCE.
IT TURNED INTO A GOLDEN TIME OF COMPETITION BETWEEN CHANNEL 9 AND CHANNEL 4.
GEORGE MICHAEL HAD AN OPEN CHECKBOOK.
GEORGE COULD COVER ANYTHING HE WANTED.
GLENN BRENNER ON THE OTHER HAND WAS PROBABLY THE MOST TALENTED CREATIVE HILARIOUS CHARACTER WHO EVER WORKED IN TELEVISION NEWS.
I MEAN WHATS THE WHATS THE CHARGE?
YOU GOT AN OVER LARGE... WEENIE?
WEENIE ON THE STREET SIR.
MY WEENIES TOO BIG?
GEORGE AND GLENN HATED EACH OTHER.
THEY WOULD GO TO THE SUPER BOWL GET THE ROOM NUMBER THAT THE OTHER GUY WAS IN AND THEN WALK INTO THE BAR AND SAY HEY DRINKS ON THE HOUSE.
MOST RESIDENTS ALSO REMEMBER A FAVORITE NEWS STATION.
MY FAVORITE WAS CHANNEL 4.
JIM VANCE WAS JUST COOL.
HES JUST A SMOOTH CAT.
HE HAD A WAY OF TELLING HIS STORIES WITHOUT GIVING UP THE COOL.
CHANNEL 9 WAS HELD IN HIGH REGARD AS THE NUMBER ONE NEWS STATION TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY COVERED THE NEWS STORIES WITHOUT OPINIONS RAISED IN THEM.
STARTING WITH HIS THIRD TERM THERE SEEMED TO BE A DETERIORATION IN THE ATTENTION THAT MARION BARRY PAID TO THE CITY.
IN JANUARY 1987 THE CITY WAS SHUT DOWN BY A MASSIVE SNOW STORM.
EVERYTHING STOPPED.
I HAD ACTUALLY HOSTED A LARGE PARTY THE NIGHT BEFORE AND WE CAME STUMBLING OUT THE DOOR INTO 6 FEET OF SNOW.
THE DAY BEFORE BARRY LEFT TOWN TO ATTEND THE SUPER BOWL IN CALIFORNIA.
HES NO GOOD BECAUSE HE DONT CLEAN THE STREET!
WHILE THE MAYOR WAS IN CALIFORNIA THE REGION WAS HIT WITH A BIGGER BLIZZARD BUT BARRY STUCK TO HIS PLANS REPORTEDLY PARTYING SO HARD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.
BARRY RETURNED TO D.C.
THE NEXT DAY.
ITS UNFORTUNATE THAT SO MUCH SNOW FELL WHICH WE CERTAINLY ARENT RESPONSIBLE FOR.
BARRYS LACK OF ATTENTION WAS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC AS CRACK CRACKRELATED VIOLENCE THREATENED TO OVERRUN THE CITY.
RELATED VIOLENCE THREATENED TO OVERRUN THE CITY.
THE STRANGE THING ABOUT HIM HE NEVER WOULD TELL YOU TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT LOCK UP THE DRUG DEALERS.
OUTSIDE OF THE KILLINGS ONE OF THE LOWEST CRIME RATES IN THE COUNTRY.
AT THE SAME TIME THE DISTRICTS YOUTH WERE DRAGGED INTO THE EPIDEMIC THE CITY CUT FUNDING FOR RECREATIONAL SERVICES LEAVING GOGOS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES TO MEET AND GATHER.
ONE ELEMENT OF GOGO IS CALL AND RESPONSE.
ITS VERY EASY FOR A LEAD TALKER TO ASK A CROWD IS SOUTHEAST BETTER THAN NORTHEAST?
AND SO THERES THIS AUTOMATIC TRIBALISM.
A FEW GOGO BANDS WOULD SORT OF ADVERTISE P.C.P. YOU KNOW.
TELL ME NOW.
WHAT YALL SMOKE?
AND THE PEOPLE WOULD RESPOND LOVE BOAT.
AND YOU GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF KIDS TOGETHER JUST TO DANCE AND ALL THAT AND SOMEBODY PULLS OUT A GUN.
GOGOS RISE TO NATIONAL PROMINENCE STALLED AS THE MUSIC BECAME IDENTIFIED WITH VIOLENCE.
IT WAS PART OF SOCIETY.
UNFORTUNATELY KNUCKLE HEADS LIKE MUSIC TOO.
 IM FEELING LIKE A...  UNDER THE NAME THE GOGO POSSE A NUMBER OF LOCAL BANDS RECORDED A SINGLE PROMOTING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE CALLED D.C. DONT STAND FOR DODGE CITY.
 LIKE THE WILD WILD WEST AND ITS CALAMITY BUT D.C. DONT MEAN DODGE CITY D.C. DONT MEAN DODGE CITY YEAH  IT DIDNT CHANGE MY LIFE BECAUSE GOGO MUSIC OFTENTIMES IT WOULD GLORIFY ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THIS PARTICULAR SONG WAS SPEAKING AGAINST.
AS THE DEATH TOLL MOUNTED THE CITY GAINED A DUBIOUS TITLE.
WASHINGTON IS NOW CALLED THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE USA.
MY KIDS WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME AND THEY HAD ON THEIR WALL A LIST OF THE PEOPLE WHO THEY KNEW EITHER FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD OR THEIR SCHOOL WHO HAD DIED.
BEFORE THEY GRADUATED FROM DUNBAR HIGH SCHOOL THAT LIST HAD GROWN TO 25 PEOPLE.
WHILE CRACK CREATED SQUALOR IN PREVIOUSLY VIBRANT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS THE CITYS COMMERCIAL AREAS WERE ENJOYING A RELATIVE BOOM.
DOWNTOWN WAS DEAD.
AND BARRY SAID WEVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
THE DEVELOPERS WENT TO HIM SAID WE WANT THIS WE WANT THAT AND GAVE THEM THE LAND VIRTUALLY FREE AND THESE PROJECTS WERE BUILT.
AND WE PERSUADED THE BANKS AND OTHERS TO LEND MONEY TO THESE DEVELOPERS.
AFTER SOME POLITICKING THE GEORGETOWN WATERFRONT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST VISTAS TO SEE RESULTS.
MARION BARRY RECOGNIZED THAT WASHINGTON HARBOR COULD BE AN ENORMOUS BOON TO THE CITY.
AND SO HE WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL.
THE SUCCESS OF PROJECTS IN GEORGETOWN AND DOWNTOWN GAVE BARRY THE CONFIDENCE TO TRY TO REDEVELOP LESS LIKELY LOCATIONS INCLUDING GROUNDZERO OF THE 68 RIOTS.
IF YOU TOLD SOMEONE YOU WERE GOING TO 14 AND U YOU WERE GOING TO BUY DRUGS PERIOD.
THE FRANK D. REEVES MUNICIPAL CENTER NAMED AFTER THE LAWYER AND LOCAL CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER OPENED IN 1986.
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO WORK IN THOSE OFFICES EVERY DAY WOULD NEED SERVICES.
AND EVEN THOUGH AT THE TIME IT SEEMED FAIRLY FARFETCHED THERE WAS A CERTAIN SENSE THAT IT WOULD RESTORE AN ELEMENT OF VALIDITY TO A ONCE FLOURISHING NEIGHBORHOOD.
SEVERAL LONGCLOSED ICONS OF THE PAST WERE ALSO RESURRECTED.
THE OLD POST OFFICE A ROMANESQUE REVIVAL STRUCTURE DATING TO 1899 HAD BEEN ON THE VERGE OF THE WRECKING BALL FOR YEARS.
SIR DAVID WILLS WHO WAS HEIR TO THE TOBACCO FORTUNE IN ENGLAND CAST A REPLICA OF THE WESTMINSTER BELLS AS A BICENTENNIAL GIFT TO THE UNITED STATES.
HE HAD THIS IDEA THAT THEY SHOULD HANG IN THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL.
BUT THE CAPITOL WASNT BUILT FOR THAT PURPOSE.
ONE BONG OF THESE GREAT BELLS AND THE CAPITOL DOME WOULD BE SITTING DOWN ON THE MALL.
THE CONGRESS WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THEY APPROPRIATED A NEW AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THAT WAS WHAT FINALLY SAVED THE ENTIRE BUILDING.
ALL THIS WAS DONE WITH PARTNERSHIPS.
AND I THINK THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN AMAZING.
SAVING UNION STATION A NEGLECTED BEAUX ARTS MASTERPIECE THAT HAD BECOME THE CITYS UNOFFICIAL HOMELESS SHELTER BECAME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PUBLICPRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL.
THEY WERE VERY CAREFUL IN PRESERVING GREAT SPACES.
D.C.s DOWNTOWN AREAS RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL BOOST AS A SLEW OF LOCAL THEATERS OPENED THEIR DOORS.
THESE LITTLE COMPANIES STARTED SPRINGING UP BECAUSE DOWNTOWN WAS SO EMPTY THAT THEY COULD GET SPACE CHEAP.
THE WOOLY MAMMOTH AND THE STUDIO THEATERS OPENING ON 14th STREET.
14th STREET SORT OF BECAME THE CENTER OF ALTERNATIVE THEATER.
BUT AT FIRST RESIDENTS WERENT CONVINCED.
I WOULD GO OVER THERE TO WATCH SOME OF THEIR SHOWS.
YOU KNOW 10 15 20 PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE PLUS THE ACTORS.
BUT IN TIME PEOPLES RELUCTANCE TO COME DOWNTOWN EASED AND WASHINGTON BEGAN ITS RISE TO AMERICAS SECOND CITY OF THEATER.
WASHINGTON WAS LIKE THAT.
I MEAN IT HAD CERTAIN KINDS OF CULTURAL NICHES IF YOU WILL.
IM A WASHINGTONIAN AND THE FIRST THEATER I EVER SAW WAS FROM THE TOP BALCONY OF THE NATIONAL.
AS WASHINGTONS THEATER SCENE GAINED COUNTRYWIDE ATTENTION IT ESTABLISHED AN AWARD NAMED IN HONOR OF ONE OF THE CITYS MOST ACCLAIMED DAUGHTERS TO RECOGNIZE LOCAL THEATRICAL EXCELLENCE.
THE GREAT WASHINGTON POST CRITIC RICHARD COE CALLED ON HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH HELEN HAYES AND TOGETHER THEY CREATED THE HELEN HAYES AWARDS AND ONCE THE HELEN HAYES AWARDS STARTED MORE COMPANIES STARTED POPPING UP.
BY THE END OF THE DECADE WASHINGTON WAS ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD AS CHICAGO.
THE REGIONS GROWING INTEREST IN THE ARTS WAS EXPLOITED BY WASHINGTONS TV AFFILIATES STILL HUNGRY FOR NOVEL PROGRAMMING.
THE KING OF THE CRITICS IN WASHINGTON D.C. WAS DAVEY MARLIN JONES.
DAVEY WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE I HAD EVER MET.
THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THERE.
DAVEY WORE HATS.
HE ALSO PUSHED THE ENVELOPE WITH HIS CLOTHES HE PUSHED HIS ENVELOPE IN EVERY WAY.
TIGHT TAUT TENSE.
DAVEY OWNED THIS TOWN.
...INSIDE THE THEATER CALLED LIFE.
A POPULAR FORMAT THAT ENCOURAGED IMITATION.
EVERY STATION IN TOWN HAD A CRITIC AND IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE ALL TRYING TO COMPETE WITH DAVEY.
IT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT GAGS OF LOCAL TELEVISION.
WHEN HE FINISHED HIS REPORT YOU DIDNT KNOW IF HE LIKED THE MOVIE OR NOT.
HOPE YOULL FIND ONE CINEMATIC SPARKLER AMONG THEM.
DAVEY MARLIN JONES.
I TRIED TO MAKE MYSELF DIFFERENT FROM DAVEY SO I USED A RATING SYSTEM.
ON MY SCALE OF 14 STARS RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK GETS A 5.
SO AT LEAST WHEN I WAS FINISHED YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT OF THE MOVIE OR NOT.
IN 1986 WASHINGTONS FOOTBALL TEAM PICKED UP JOURNEYMAN QUARTERBACK DOUG WILLIAMS TO BACK UP ITS YOUNG PHENOM JAY SCHROEDER.
DURING THE FOLLOWING SEASON WILLIAMS SHARED QUARTERBACK DUTIES WITH THE OFTINJURED SCHROEDER.
BUT ONCE THE TEAM MADE IT TO THE PLAYOFFS WILLIAMS PERFORMANCE PUT AN END TO ANY CONTROVERSY.
WE HAD TO GO TO CHICAGO PLAY IN 13 BELOW TEMPERATURE.
WE WON.
THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS I CAME OFF THE BENCH AND WE WON THE GAME AND AT THE COACHES PRESS CONFERENCE HE MENTIONED THAT I WAS GOING TO BE THE STARTING QUARTERBACK.
BEING THE FIRST AFRICANAMERICAN TO PLAY IN THE SUPER BOWL I REALLY CHERISHED THAT TIME AND FOR TWO WEEKS LEADING UP TO THAT GAME IT WAS PRETTY MUCH CRAZY.
THE GAME STARTED OUT BADLY.
TOUCHDOWN DENVER 56...
THE SCORE WAS 100 AGAINST THE REDSKINS IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
AND THEN IT GOT WORSE.
I HYPEREXTENDED MY KNEE.
DIDNT KNOW AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME WHETHER OR NOT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO FINISH THE FOOTBALL GAME.
I WAS GOING TO SUBSTITUTE FOR HIM HE SAID HEY GET BACK OUT.
THIS IS MY TEAM.
IN AN HISTORIC REVERSAL OF FORTUNE THE TEAM SCORED 5 TOUCHDOWNS IN THE SECOND QUARTER.
TOUCHDOWN!
WASHINGTON TAKES THE LEAD!
EVERYTHING WE CALLED WORKED.
HES GOT SANDERS IN THE CLEAR.
AT THE 10 TOUCHDOWN!
TOUCHDOWN WASHINGTON REDSKINS!
AND A NEW SUPER BOWL RECORD!
I REMEMBER HIM HOLDING THAT HELMET WHEN HE SCORED 35 POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER.
IT WAS PROBABLY THE GREATEST QUARTER OF A GAME IN SUPER BOWL HISTORY.
DOUG WILLIAMS THE MVP OF SUPER BOWL XXII.
WILLIAMS WAS THE FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK TO START OR WIN A SUPER BOWL AND WAS CROWNED THE GAMES MOST VALUABLE PLAYER.
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES THAT I RAISED MY HAT AND THINKING TO MYSELF YOU KNOW ID REALLY LIKE TO TELL SOME PEOPLE WHERE TO GO BUT IT WASNT IN MY NATURE TO DO IT.
CHEERING AS THE 80s DREW TO A CLOSE BARRYS LIFESTYLE CONTINUED TO MAKE HEADLINES.
AT NO TIME DID I SEE ANY DRUGS USE ANY DRUGS OR HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY DRUGS.
THAT LITTLE WHITE POWDER IS SO POWERFUL.
IT CAUSES YOU TO DO THINGS THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU NEVER WOULD DO.
THE FBI UNCOVERED MORE ALLEGATIONS OF DRUG USE AND RAMPANT CORRUPTION AMONG BARRYS STAFF THAT INCLUDED DEPUTY MAYOR IVANHOE DONALDSON.
I HAVE BEEN TRIED CONVICTED SENTENCED AND DOIN TIME BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA.
I THINK MARION WAS VERY GOOD ABOUT PLAYING THE VICTIM.
SOMEBODY SET HIM UP SOMEBODY WAS PICKING ON HIM.
HE DIDNT HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO STICK TO VIRTUALLY ANYTHING.
IVE HEARD MORE FROM BARRY ABOUT HOW HES GOING TO BEHAVE BETTER THAN I HAVE FOR MY OWN SON.
DESPITE IT ALL BARRY RETAINED A GRIP ON POWER KEPT AFLOAT BY HIS POPULIST APPEAL.
I THINK THAT SOME BLACK FOLKS IN THE CITY REALLY THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING AFTER MARION BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK AND I DONT THINK THAT WAS NECESSARILY THE CASE.
IM A VERY CONTROVERSIAL PERSON BECAUSE I SPEAK OUT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IM LOVED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE.
IN FACT PEOPLE SAY MARION BARRY YOURE THE BEST MAYOR WE EVER HAD!
THEY TELL THE TRUTH TOO.
HA HA!
MARION BARRY DOMINATED WASHINGTON IN THE 80s.
HE WAS THE SUN AROUND WHICH WE ALL ORBITED.
THE GOOD THINGS THE BAD THINGS.
BUT EVEN THOUGH THE CITY AND THE MAYORS EARLY PROMISE WERE NOW LOST AMONGST DYSFUNCTI AND DECAY RESIDENTS DEPARTED THE 80s WITH GOOD MEMORIES AND OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE.
YOU COULD DO 60 MILES AN HOUR UP MASS AVENUE AND NOBODY WOULD BLINK AN EYELASH.
MY KIDS WHO GREW UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT LOOK BACK FONDLY ON THEIR YOUNGER DAYS.
ILL NEVER FORGET WHEN THEY GRADUATED THEY SAID WE KNOW THE BEST PART OF OUR LIVES ARE PROBABLY BEHIND US RIGHT NOW.
DANGER IS EXCITING.
THERE WAS LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ART TO SPRING UP LIKE LITTLE FLOWERS IN THE GARDEN.
AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL COMBINATION.
 KEEP ON MOVING DONT STOP LIKE THE HANDS OF TIME CLICK CLOCK FIND YOUR OWN WAY TO STAY THE TIME WILL COME ONE DAY WHY DO PEOPLE CHOOSE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES...
THIS WAY?
YEAH KEEP ON MOVING DONT STOP NO KEEP ON MOVING OH HO WHOA...  DISCOVER MORE ABOUT WASHINGTON IN THE 80s AT WETA.ORG.
