LS AMERICA."
REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON, I AM LAURA TREVELYAN.
COUNTDOWN TO THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL CALL FOR UNITY IN FRONT OF A DEEPLY DIVIDED CONGRESS.
MR. NEESON, ARE YOU SORRY FOR WHAT YOU SAID?
LAURA: ACTOR LIAM NEESON SAYS HE IS NO RACIST AFTER HIS DESIRE FOR REVENGE CAUSES AN UPROAR.
VERY FIRST PICTURE I TOOK.
LAURA: PLUS, DON MCCULLIN'S CAMERA CAPTURED THE HUMAN COST OF BATTLE.
WE HEAR HOW HE TURNED HIS LENS ON THE HOME FRONT, TOO.
LAURA: WELCOME TO OUR VIEWERS ON PUBLIC TELEVISION IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE GLOBE.
WASHINGTON IS POISED FOR TONIGHT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
AIDES SAY HE WILL CALL FOR BIPARTISAN COOPERATION AND UNITY.
BUT MR. TRUMP WILL DELIVER HIS PRIMETIME ADDRESS TO A DIVIDED CONGRESS WHILE STILL SMARTING AFTER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER THE PRESIDENTS CALL FOR A BORDER WALL WITH MEXICO.
KATTY KAY JOINED ME EARLIER.
WHITE HOUSE AIDES HAVE SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT COMITY, BUT GIVEN HOW DIVIDED THE TWO SIDES ARE, CAN ANYTHING BE ACHIEVED?
KATTY: LOOK, I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO TONIGHT IS REACH OUT TO VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE WITH SOME SORT OF UNITY AND BIPARTISANSHIP.
WE WILL HEAR THAT TOWNE -- TONE.
IT IS BEING WRITTEN INTO HIS SPEECH AT THE MOMENT. AND ALSO APPEAL TO HIS BASE WITH A TOUGHER LINE ON IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER WALL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS HE WILL NOT GET A TELEVISION AUDIENCE THIS BIG AGAIN UNTIL THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS WELL UNDERWAY. AND SO HE HAS GOT THAT POLITICAL TIMETABLE IN MIND.
JUGGLING THOSE TWO THINGS IS GOING TO BE TRICKY IN TERMS OF TONE, AND WE KNOW WHAT IS SAID IN A SPEECH TONIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL COULD VERY QUICKLY BE OVERTURNED WITH ONE TWEET TOMORROW MORNING.
LAURA: IT CAN INDEED.
IS THIS LAYING OUT THE BATTLE LINES FOR THE 2020 ELECTION?
KATTY: I THINK IT IS.
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS DO AGREE.
THEY COULD DO A BIG DEAL ON INFRASTRUCTURE. I SUSPECT WE WILL HEAR THE PRESIDENT REACH OUT TO DEMOCRATS ON AN ISSUE LIKE THAT.
THE TROUBLE IS THERE IS SO LITTLE TRUST ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THIS PRESIDENT THAT ARE THEY WILLING TO GIVE HIM SOME KIND OF DEAL THAT HE CAN TAKE HOME AND SAY, LOOK, I'VE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING?
THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IN A SENSE IS STARTING RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE ALREADY HAD THOSE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WHO HAVE LAUNCHED THEIR BIDS.
THEY WILL BE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT.
TONIGHT IS HIS BIG AUDIENCE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE HAS ACHIEVED AND WHAT HE CAN STILL ACHIEVE, AND THE SPECTACLE OF THIS CROWD -CROWNED BY NANCY PELOSI SITTING RIGHT BEHIND HIM, THE DEMOCRAT WHO HAS JUST GIVEN HIM A TOUGH TIME, TOUGH RUN FOR HIS MONEY OVER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
YOU ARE RIGHT, THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS ALL OVER THIS STATE OF THE NOON ADDRESS.
LAURA: WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR WHEN YOU SEE NANCY PELOSI THERE, THE SYMBOL OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE PRESIDENT?
KATTY: IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER IN EVERY SHOT, BECAUSE IN THESE STATES OF THE UNIONS, YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT AND THEN THE TWO PEOPLE, MIKE PENCE AND NANCY PELOSI BEHIND HIM. THEY ARE IN ALMOST EVERY SHOT.
IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER OF THIS NEW, TOUGHER POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES.
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF SHE GIVES HIM A MUCH MORE THAN A CURSORY ROUND OF APPLAUSE IN THE BEGINNING.
THE REST OF THE TIME I EXPECT HER TO SIT STONEFACED WHILE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE IT'S THEIR CHEERING.
THAT IS THE KIND OF PROSPECT THAT ALWAYS COMES UP IN STATES OF THE UNION.
REMEMBER, IT IS NOT JUST NANCY PELOSI SITTING BEHIND HIM.
IT IS ALL THOSE NEWLY ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT STATE OF THE UNION AUDIENCE IN THAT CHAMBER THAN IT WAS FOR HIM A YEAR AGO.
LAURA: KATTY KAY, THANK YOU.
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A MARQUEE EVENT, A SPEECH WHICH IS REWRITTEN MULTIPLE TIMES.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH TONIGHT'S PAGES WITH HIS SHARPIE REWORKING THE MATERIAL.
IT IS ALL ABOUT STRIKING THE RIGHT TONE WHILE LEAVING AN IMPRESSION FOR THE AGES.
HERE ARE EXAMPLES FROM THE PAST.
PRES. REAGAN: DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND HER.
THAT THE AMERICAN SPIRIT HAS BEEN VANQUISHED.
PRES. CLINTON: THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS OVER.
PRES. BUSH: THEIR TERRORIST ALLIES CONSTITUTE AN AXIS OF EVIL, ARMING TO THREATEN THE PEACE OF THE WORLD.
LAURA: FOR MORE ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE MAJOR ADDRESSES AND THE WORK THAT GOES INTO THEM, I SPOKE EARLIER WITH STEPHEN KRUPIN, A FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A HIGHLY CHOREOGRAPHED ONE.
JUST HOW HIGH ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS SPEECH TONIGHT?
STEPHEN: THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD LIKE TO SET OUT AN EXPECTATION THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AS YOU AND KATTY MENTIONED, A SPEECH OF UNITY, WHICH IS AS CREDIBLE AS MUCH ELSE FROM THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE.
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER.
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM. WE CANNOT LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS TONIGHT WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY AND WHAT HE WILL SAY TOMORROW.
IF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO STIGMATIZE IMMIGRANTS AND SPURN ALLIES, HOW IS THAT UNITY?
IF THE WHITE HOUSE GOES TO SUCH EXTREMES TO MAKE THAT CASE THAT THIS IS A CASE ABOUT UNITY, IF HE DOES THAT ONE DAY A YEAR USING SENTENCES THAT WE KNOW DON'T SOUND THE WAY PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WE ALL KNOW SOUNDS, IT GIVES LIE TO THE WHOLE CHARADE.
LAURA: BUT AS A FORMER SPEECHWRITER, HOW MUCH WORK WOULD GO INTO A SPEECH LIKE THIS?
STEPHEN: AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK.
IT STARTS MONTHS BEFORE THE SPEECH ITSELF.
IT IS A SPEECH WHERE NOT ONLY THE WHITE HOUSE IS FOCUSED ON IT, THE COMMUNICATIONS, POLICY, THE RESEARCH PARTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT ALSO ALL THE CABINET AGENCIES.
EVERYONE WANTS THEIR LINE IN THAT PRECIOUS REAL ESTATE, BECAUSE WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYS IT TO THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD, IT ELEVATES THEIR ISSUE.
LAURA: TYPICALLY THESE SPEECHES HAS A BIG HISTORICAL SWEEP.
THE TRADITION BEGAN WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON HIMSELF.
STEPHEN: IT IS. IT IS HISTORICAL AND THE HISTORY IS ALL ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY.
IT IS NOT THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING TO THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD FROM THE OVAL OFFICE.
IT IS THE PRESIDENT COMING TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AT THE INVITATION OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, WHICH UNDERSCORES THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND THE PRESIDENT WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT NEEDS CONGRESS TO PASS HIS AGENDA.
LAURA: ALTHOUGH WE HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT, ESPECIALLY THIS ONE, IN A VARIETY OF WAYS ON TWITTER AND IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCES, AS AN OCCASION DO YOU THINK THE STATE OF THE UNION RETAINS ITS POWER?
STEPHEN: I THINK IT RETAINS ITS POWER IN A GENERAL SENSE BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING TO ALL GOVERNMENT ASSEMBLED, AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEYOND AND AROUND THE WORLD.
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, I THINK IT DOES HIM A DISSERVICE.
I THINK THE STATE OF THE UNION IS HIS MOST UNNATURAL VENUE.
IT IS AT ITS BEST AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALL FOR UNITY, WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES NOT DO. HE SPEAKS TO HIS BASE, HE IS DIVISIVE. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THE TRUTH, WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T DO.
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CAREFUL RHETORIC, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CARELESS AT BEST WITH HIS RHETORIC.
LAURA: WE WILL SEE HOW HE DOES TONIGHT. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN STARTED THIS TRADITION OF MENTIONING IN HIS SPEECH PEOPLE HE BROUGHT AS GUESTS,
AND IT HAS BECOME QUITE A BIT OF STAGECRAFT.
STEPHEN: IT IS ABSOLUTELY STAGECRAFT.
IT IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO SHOW THAT THE POLICY SPOKEN ABOUT IN THE ADDRESS ACTUALLY AFFECTS REAL PEOPLE, REAL AMERICANS, NOT JUST ABSTRACT POLITICAL THEORY
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED TO DO WAS TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO REPRESENTED THE STRUGGLES OR THE CHALLENGES OR THE ASPIRATIONS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE GOING THROUGH.
IN 2015 THERE WAS A FAMILY FROM MINNESOTA WHOSE STORY OF PERSEVERANCE WAS A NICE METAPHOR FOR THE WAY THE COUNTRY WAS COMING OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION.
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY PRESIDENT OBAMA USED THESE GUESTS IS IT SPOKE TO THE COUNTRY'S HOPES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP OFTEN USES THEM EXPLOITATIVE WAY TO SPEAK OF -TO OUR FEARS.
LAURA: WE WILL SEE WHAT THE SPEECH DOES TONIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
STEPHEN: GOOD TO BE HERE.
LAURA: THE ACTOR LIAM NEESON SAYS HE IS NO RACIST AFTER ADMITTING HE ONCE WALKED TO THE STREETS LOOKING FOR A BLACK MAN TO KILL.
HE DESCRIBED A PRIMAL URGE FOR REVENGE AFTER A FRIEND WAS RAPED.
THE BBC'S NICK BRYANT HAS MORE FROM NEW YORK.
NICK: AFTER HIS EXPLOSIVE COMMENTS ABOUT RACE AND REVENGE, MR. NEESON, ARE YOU SORRY FOR WHAT YOU SAID?
MR. NEESON ARRIVED AT THIS NEW YORK TELEVISION STUDIO NOT TO MAKE AN APOLOGY BUT TO OFFER A EXPLANATION.

HE ADMITTED TO SETTING OUT TO KILL AN INNOCENT BLACK MAN NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO AFTER SOMEONE CLOSE TO HIM WAS ALLEGEDLY RAPED BY A BLACK MAN.
WOULD YOU HAVE HAD THE SAME REACTION IF IT WAS A WHITE MAN?
