 WELCOME BACK TO WAKE UP WASHINGTON THE RECORDBREAKING FILM BLACK PANTHER IS THE FIRST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER TO BE NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE.
IT FEATURES A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK CAST AND GIVES A BLACK BOYS AND GIRLS A CHANCE TO IMAGINE THEMSELVES AS SUPERHEROES.
BLACK PANTHER IS ALL ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF AFRO FUTURISM.
WE EXPLAIN THE HISTORY AND REVIVAL AS WE CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
I SEE THESE POSTS AT TIMES WHERE PEOPLE SAY I JUST WANT TO SEE BLACK MERMAIDS AND BLACK PEOPLE IN SPACE WE DECEIVE BLACK STORIES THAT ARENT ABOUT BLACK PAIN BECAUSE THE CONFERENCE  CONSTANT.
THIS WRITER IS AMONG THE ARTISTS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE RESURGENCE OF AFRO FUTURISM.
IT IS JUST KIND OF A UTOPIA TO IMAGINE WHAT IS.
WHAT THE STORY WASNT A STORY OF HAVING EVERYTHING TAKEN AWAY AND HAVING SO MUCH LIKE OPPRESSION AND BRUTALITY AND SENSELESS MURDER AND SLAVERY?
WHAT IF IT COULD BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?
THAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE BESTSELLER CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE A WEST AFRICAN FANTASY NOVELS FEATURING A YOUNG BLACK FEMALE PROTAGONIST.
WHEN DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT WOMEN OF COLOR OR MEN OF COLOR IN CHILDREN OF COLOR CAN BE FANTASY CHARACTERS?
I DIDNT REALIZE UNTIL MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL THAT NO CHARACTERS LOOKED LIKE ME SO ALL OF MY PROTAGONIST WORK WHITE OR BIRACIAL.
THEN I REALIZED ITS NOT JUST ME WHO NEEDS THIS ITS OTHER PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME ITS ALSO PEOPLE WHO DONT LOOK LIKE ME BECAUSE THE REASON I DIDNT THINK I COULD BE IN THE STORE WAS BECAUSE I DIDNT SEE IT.
THROUGH HER WRITING SHE DIRECTLY TACKLES RACISM AND INEQUALITY.
I WANTED TO WRITE A STORY THAT COMMENTED ON THE BLACK EXPERIENCE.
IN SOME WAYS AFRO FUTURISM IS A REVOLUTIONARY ACT DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A REVOLUTIONARY?
AT THIS POINT I CAN THINK OF MYSELF AS A PART OF THE REVOLUTION AND SO DOES JENELLE MONET.
ON HER NEW ALBUM DIRTY COMPUTER SHE EXPLORES AFRO FUTURISM THROUGH MUSIC.
AFRO FUTURISM IS ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE US SEEING OURSELVES IN THE FUTURE AND KNOWING THAT WE ARE NOT THE STEREOTYPE THAT HAS BEEN PERPETUATED ON US.
SHE BELIEVES THIS IS A TIME FOR AFROCENTRIC AFROCENTRIC ART.
ITS A WAY FOR BLACK WOMEN LIKE MYSELF TO TELL OUR STORIES THROUGH OUR OWN LENS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE TELLING OUR STORY.
IF WE ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT US TO TELL OUR STORY THEY MAY NOT BE TOLD PROPERLY.
ENTER BLACK PANTHER WITH A BLACK SUPERHERO AND A NEARLY ALL BLACK CAST SET IN AN AFRICAN INSPIRED UTOPIA SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE PANTHER POPULARIZED THE IDEA OF AFRO FUTURISM BUT THE TRUTHS RUN DEEP.
ALL OF THE EARLY ABOLITIONISTS THAT WE CELEBRATE FREDERICK DOUGLASS THEY WERE ALL AFRO FUTURISTS GEORGE CLINTON.
CULTURAL RIDDICK GREG TATE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE LEADING SCHOLARS OF THIS MOVEMENT.
ANYBODY WHO HAD A VISION OF BLACK PEOPLES STORIES AND PRESENCE AND IMAGING CAN BE TOLD AND ELEVATED.
ON ONE HAND WE HAVE A MOVIE LIKE BLACK PANTHER WHICH IS THE ENTRY POINT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THEN YOU HAVE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENTS.
DO YOU SEE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS?
DEFINITELY.
I DONT THINK THAT BLACK PANTHER WOULDVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE PRECEDENT OF BLACK LIVES MATTER BECAUSE I THINK AT ANY TIME THERES OUTRAGE AND PROTEST IN THE STREET THE CULTURAL ELITE IN AMERICA TEND TO OPEN UP RESOURCES AND ACTUALLY IN SPACE FOR BLACK CREATORS.
AND RESPONSE SUGGEST AUDIENCES WILL START TO SEE EVEN MORE AFRO FUTURIST ART BLACK PANTHER SNAGGED THE TOP FRIES AT SAG AWARDS AND WAS NOMINATED FOR SEVEN OSCARS.
AND A SEQUEL IS UNDERWAY.
THE BOOK IS BEING MADE INTO A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE WITH TWO MORE BOOKS IN THE WORKS.
YOU THINK ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT ARE CHANGING?
I DEFINITELY THINK THEY ARE CHANGING.
WE ARE FINALLY GETTING TO SEE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SHARE WITH PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WHO DONT THINK THAT OH PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RELATE TO THIS BECAUSE IT IS BLACK OR THEY WONT RELATE TO THIS BECAUSE ITS AFRICAN ITS TWO DIFFERENT NO THIS IS A GREAT STORY GREAT CHARACTER LETS MAKE IT VISIBLE AND WHEN PEOPLE FIND IT THEY WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT.
AM PRETTY HAPPY TO SEE THE DIRECTION THAT ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT IS HEADING IN NOW IT SEEMS MORE INCLUSIVE AND FILMS LIKE THAT YOU LITTLE BOYS AND LITTLE GIRLS WHO SAY HEY I SEE MYSELF THERE AND I CAN BE ANYTHING I WANT I COULD BE A SUPERHERO I CAN CONQUER WHATEVER I WANT.
IM EXCITED TO SEE HOW BLACK PANTHER DOES AT THE OSCARS.
I KNOW ITS BEEN SWEEPING UP A LOT OF AWARDS.
IT WILL BE THE TALK OF THE TOWN TOMORROW MORNING.
FOR SURE.
THE TALK AND THEN RUN HERE IS THE FORECAST.
WE HAVE A BUMPY RIDE WE HAVE SHOWERS MOVING OUT AND TURNING WARMER TODAY BUT IT IS WINDY SO THE GUSTY WINDS COULD BRING DOWN TREES AND POWER LINES BETWEEN TODAY AND TONIGHT AND TOMORROW MORNING THATS WHEN WE SEE WINDS GUSTING IN THE METRO AS HIGH AS 50 MILES PER HOUR AND HIGHER THAN THAT OUT IN THE MOUNTAIN.
