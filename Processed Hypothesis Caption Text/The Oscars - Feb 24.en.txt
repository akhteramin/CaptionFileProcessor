Background music If we show emotwere called dramatic.

But a women running a marathon is crazy.
ANNOUNCER Officials tried to pull her off the course A woman boxing was crazy.
dunking crazy.
Coaching an NBA team crazy.
A woman competing in a hijab.
Changing her sport.
Landing a double cork 1080.
Or winning 23 grand slams having a baby and then coming back for more.
Crazy crazy crazy crazy and crazy.
SFX Crowd cheering So if they want to call you crazy fine.
Show them what crazy can do.
Background music Its only crazy until you do it.
Background music Just do it.
Today faster than ever the world is changing because opportunity is raging.
Mixed Reality changing the world we see intelligence to build it like wed always hoped it would be.
But its not really about what technology can do its about how its used by you.
In the end its just a tool so bring it whats a hammer without a person to swing it.
Your possibility is endless your limits are few.
