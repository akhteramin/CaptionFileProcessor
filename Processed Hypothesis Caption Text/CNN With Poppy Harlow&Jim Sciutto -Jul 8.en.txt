 MANEUVER INTO SOME SORT OF TALKS THAT WOULD BE THE BEST POSITION FOR THEM.
OKAY.
KIM BER LE THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERTISE.
APPRECIATE IT.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS THE TOP OF THE HOUR.
GOOD MONDAY MORNING.
IM IN NEW YORK.
WE BEGIN WITH THIS HOUR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE JUST UNSEALED AN INDICTMENT AGAINST JEFFREY EP TEEN.
INSIDE IT THE ALARMING DETAILS OF HOW THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED BILLIONAIRE ALLEGEDLY RAN A SEX TRAFFICKING RING.
HES ACCUSED OF SEEKING OUT MINERS AND PAYING CASH TO GIRLS AS YOUNG AS 14 YEARS OLD AND THEN PAYING THEM TO RECRUIT OTHER GIRLS FOR HIM TO ABU ANUND IN PUBLIC.CHARGES WILL BE A PRESS CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD WITH PROSECUTORS AND THE FBI AND LATER THIS MORNING EPSTEIN WILL APPEAR IN COURT.
STILL UNKNOWN WHAT THIS CASE COULD REVEAL ABOUT HIS POLITICAL CONNTIS AND THEY INCLUDE A BRITISH ROYAL A PRESIDENT AND THE CURRENT ONE EPSTEIN QUOTE A TERRIFIC GUY.
WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING.
OUR ANCHOR AND NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT ERICA HILL IS ME COURTHOUSE.
SHIMON Y HELDRE ND ADEY ENCOUNT ESCALATED.
AND SOME OF THE GIRLS SAYING  IN SOME OF JULIE BROWNS REPORTING WE SHOULD POINT OUT.
THE ALLEGED VICTIMS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DIDNT KNOW IT WAS GOING TO MAYBE GO THAT WAY.
OR THEY KNEW IT WASNT RIGHT BUT AGAIN THEY WERE YOUNG AND DIDNT GET IT.
AND IT ALSO POINTS OUT IN THE INDICTMENT THAT THEY BELIEVE PROSECUTORS BELIEVE HE DID KNOW THEIR AGES AND WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE SOME OF THESE VICTIMS WHO WERE IN HERE WERE ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THEIR AGE AND THEY SAID THEY DIDNT LIE.
LETS TALK ABOUT THE POWERFUL PEOPLE IN POLITICS THAT WERE FRIENDS INCLUDING PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WHICH I THINK RECORDS SHOW FLEW ON HIS JET SEVERAL TIMES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS QUOTED WITH GLOWING WORDS ABOUT HIM BACK IN NAIN FACT.
IN 2002 HE TALKED ABOUT HIM TO NEW YORK MAGAZINE HE SAID HES A TERRIFIC GUY HES A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH.
ITS EVEN SAID THAT HE LIKES BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AS MUCH AS I DO AND MANY OF THEM ARE ON THE YOUNGER SIDE.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT JEFFREY ENJOYS HIS SOCIAL LIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY THATS SEEN IN A FAR DIFFERENT LIGHT TODAY.
BUT THERE IS A CONNECTION HERE.
YOU MENTIONED FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON FLYING ON HIS PLANE BEING ON HIS PRIVATE ISLAND.
PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY ON HIS PLANE.
AND AT ONE POINT EP TEEN WAS A MEMBER OF MARALAGO AND HAD BEEN THERE BUT WAS BARRED AT ONE POINT.
HE WAS ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING AN UNDERAGE GIRL THERE.
I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO BRING UP WITH YOU THE CURRENT LABOR SECRETARY ALEXANDER ACOSTA WHO IS VERY TIED TO THIS BECAUSE HE WAS A PART OF SECURING THE SWEET PLEA DEAL FOR EPSTEIN BACK IN 2008 THAT GOT HIM VERY LITTLE JAIL TIME CHARGED WITH PROSTITUTION NOT SEX TRAFFICKING AND BY THE WAY THAT NONE OF THE VICTIMS KNEW ABOUT.
NO.
THEY DIDNT.
SO A COUPLE OF POINTS THERE.
NUMBER ONE YOURE RIGHT.
ALEXANDER ACOSTA AT THE TIME WAS THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT SO HE HAD TO OVERSEE THIS DEAL.
HE TO SAY OKAY WITH TEAM OF ATTORNEYS.
AT THE TIME HE SAID THEY LACKED THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD VIOLATED FEDERAL LIEU.
THERES BEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON THAT SINCE.
WELL THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING HOW THE CASE WAS HANDLE.
WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN FEBRUARY A FEDERAL JUDGE SAID THIS DEAL BROKE THE LAW BECAUSE THE VICTIMS DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
THE TERMS OF THIS DEAL WHICH ITS BEEN SAID MULTIPLE TIMES WERE BASICALLY DICTATED BY EPSTEINS ATTORNEYS POWERFUL ATTORNEYS THEY DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
THE DEAL WAS KEPT QUIET AND KEPT APART FROM THE VICTIMS UNTIL A JUDGE SIGNED OFF ON IT.
YOU CANT DO THAT.
THAT BROKE THE LAW.
GREAT REPORTING.
OBVIOUSLY WELL BE ON THIS ALL DAY BECAUSE HES GOING TO BE IN COURTHIS MORNING.
LETS TALK ABOUT WHERE THIS GORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IS HERE.ARE A G VOICE THIS BECAUSE YOUE ACTUALLY PROSECUTED SEX TRAFFICKING CASES BEFORE.
ONE THING THAT SHIMON SAID OUTSIDHEOURTENTS AGO THAT STRUCK ME IS THAT WHAT MAY BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAN THE PLEA DEAL IN 2008 IF THIS GOES TO TRIAL IS THAT THEY HAE THREE COOPERATORS AND THOSEORE APPARENTLY SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARRANGED THE TRAVEL OF THE UNDERAGE GIRLS TO BE WITH EPSTEIN.
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT?
WELL ITS IMPORTANT.
I MEAN FRANKLY I THINK THE CASE IS GOING TO RISE AND FALL FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ON THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE COOPERATORS.
THESE CASES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO INVESTIGATE.
THEYRE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE.
OFTEN MINORS WHO ARE ABUSED HAVE DIFFICULTY COMING FORWARD AND TESTIFYING.
THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY GOING THROUGH AND DOING WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO TO BE A I A CASE.
SO REALLY HERE THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE HAS TO BE STRONG IN ORDER FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT TO MAKE ITS CASE IN COURT.
AND WHAT I THINK THIS INDICTMENT TELLS US IS THAT THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE TESTIMONY THAT CAN BACK THESE CHARGES UP.
WHEN YOU DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK THAT RAISED SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT THE VICTIMS DIDNT KNOW ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE NOW NOT ONLY FOR ALEXANDER ACOSTA THE LABOR SECRETARY WHO WAS A BIG PART OF THIS BUT THE JUDGE WHO SIGNED OFF ON IT?
YEAH I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT MR. ACOSTAS ACTS THERE.
REALLY THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT BEHINDTHESCENES THAT CAUSED THAT SERIES OF EVENTS.
THERES CLEARLY MISCONDUCT BY NOT INFORMING VICTIMS.
IT APPEARS AT SOME POINT THERE WERE MISREPRESENTATIONS THAT WERE MADE TO THE COURT.
VERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS.
PARTICULARLY IN CASES LIKE THIS WHEN I DID INVESTIGATE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES THOSE VICTIMS ARE COUNTING ON YOU AS A PROSECUTOR.
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO YOU AND THEY ARE COUNTING ON YOU TO PROSECUTE AND ACT FAIRLY.
ANDT IS INTERESTING THAT THE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS WORKING ON THIS THAT ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN A LITTLE UNDER AN HOUR ARE FROM THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORKS PUBLIC CORRUPTION UNIT.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
COULD BE THEYUST HAVE TIME E THEIR PLATES.
BUT IT ALSO COULD MEAN THAT THERES SOME TIE TOHIS CASE EITHER FROM THE ANGLE YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT OR ANOTHER THERES ON POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION PROVISION.
PERHAPS THERE IS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL THAT COULD THAT IS AT LEAST INVOLVED IN T CASE OUE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALSO THIS MORNING AS MORE IMAGES AND REPORTS OFHUMANE COE MIGRANT FIEM BORDER THE PR SAYS HE NOW WANTS THE MEDIA TO GO INSIDE AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES.
KAITLYN US FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
KAITLYN THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS THIS BUT THERES A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING THAT AND THE FACILITIES ACTUALLY LETTING IN JOURNALISTS WITH CAMERASUNANNOUNCED.
SO FAR THEYVE BEEN HESITANT NOT WANTAWMAKERS TO BRING THEIR PHONES INTO THE FACILITIES.
SO WHETHER OR NOT THAT INVITATION ISNG TO GO FORWARD IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION.
BUT SO FAR THE PRESIDENT AND HI REPORTS ABOUT THESE CONDITIONS AT THE BORDER.
HERES WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY.
IM GOING TO START SHOWING SOME OF THESE DETENTION CENTERS TO THE PRESS.
THEYRE CROWDED AND WERE THE ONES WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEYRE CROWDED.
SO THE PRESIDENT THERE GOING AFTER NOT ONLY SOME OF THOSE DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTING WHAT THEY SAW WHEN THEYVE TOURED THESE FACILITIES.
WE SHOULD NOTE ITS NOT JUST ONE SINGULAR REPORT DETAILING THESE CONDITIONS THAT THEY SAY ARE WIDESPREAD AT THESE FACILITIES.
OVERCROWDING AND STANDING ROOM ONLY.
PEOPLE GOING WITHOUT HOT MEALS.
ITS COMING FROM A REPORT FROM THE PRESIDENTS OWN GOVERNMENT AND A VERY SPECIFIC IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND PEOPLE SHOULD READ.
AND NATASHA YOURE THERE AND YOU SPOKE TO A REP WHO SAYS BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR SOME TIME TO BRING THESE CONDITIONS TO LIGHT.
THATS RIGHT POPPY.
WE WERE TALKING TO REPRESENTATIVE MARY GONE SQUALL ES.
SHE REPRESENTS THE AREA WHERE THE FACILITY IS.
SHE SAYS THAT LOCAL LEADERS LIKE HERSELF AND THE COMMUNITY DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WERE BEING PROCESSED THROUGH THAT FACILITY UNTIL NEWS REPOS CAME OUT IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO ABOUT THE CONDITIONS INSIDE.
SHE SAID THAT SOME OF THESE ATROL AGENTS WHOA LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY WAVE KNOWN HER FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING HER ABOUT HOW DEMORALIZING AND SDPRESING IT IS TO WORK IN THE CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE SEEING DAY TO DAY WITH THE MIGRANTS.
THEYVE ALSO TOLD HER ABOUT HOW HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN AT ONE POINT WERE BEING PROCESSED THROUGH THAT FACILITY IN A SPACE THATS REALLY NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT MANY KIDS AND BEING HELD THERE FOR LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD BE THERE WITH LIMITED SHOWER AND SHOWER FACILITIES TO WASH UP LIMITED MICROWAVES TO HEAT FOOD TO FEED THEM.
HERES WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HER CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE AGENTS.
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO WHO WORKED THERE WERE SAYING WE HAVE BEEN TELLING HIGHERUPS THERES A PROBLEM.
AND BASICALLY THOSE PLEAS HAVE BEEN IGNORED.
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO I TALKED TO HAVE BEEN IN THE BORDER PATROL FOR DECADES 23 YEARS 24 YEARS.
THIS IS SOMETHING VERY NEW TO THEM.
THEY WERE NEVER CHARGED WITH BEING CARE TAKERS OF CHILDREN.
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT MY COMMUNITY IS STRUGGLING WITH AN ADMINISTRATIONMADE PROBLEM.
AND GONZALEZ DID SAY THAT SHE GOT TO VISIT INSIDE THE CLINT FACILITY LAST WEEK WHEN THERE WERE FAR FEWER CHILDREN.
MANY OF THEM HAVE NOW BEEN PROCESSED OUT.
WE DID ALSO HEAR FROM THE SECTOR CHIEF OF THE EL PASO REGION WHO SAID NOW IN THIS REGION THEY HAVE ONLY 26 CHILDREN IN CUSTODY.
HE DISPUTES THEORTS OF THE INHUMANE CONDITIONS INSIDE BUT HE DOES ACKNOWLEDGE ITS VERY POSSIBLE AGENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT CONDITIONS AND OVERCROWDING IN THE PAST.
HE SAYS THEYVE ALL BEEN COMPLAINING THAT THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY CHILDREN AND NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO PROCESS THEM THROUGH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE REPORTING FOR TALKING TO HER.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
STILL TO COME THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS TAKING A NEW STRATEGY AS IT PUSHES TO TRY TO GET A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE UPCOMING CENSUS.
PLUS NEW FIGHTING WORDS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI TAKES ON CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA OCASCIOCORTEZ AND LATER THE U.S. WOMEN AREEADING HOME WITH ANORLD CUP TITLE AND READY TO TAKE ON A BIGGER BATTLE EQUAL PAY.
That Karl brought his karaoke machine?
 Aint nothing but a heartache...  No I cant believe how easy it was to save hundreds of dollars on my car insurance with GEICO.
 I never wanna hear you say...  No Kevin... no Kevin!

Neutrogena NEW TEAM NEW ARGUMENT.
AFTER THE SUPREME COURT RULED AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS ATTEMPT TO ADD A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE CENSUS THIS MORNING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS A DIFFERENT TEAM OF LAWYERS WILL NOW TAKE UP THIS BATTLE.
FOR MORE ON WHY JESSICA SCHNEIDER OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT IS IN DC.
SO EVEN AFTER THE SUPREME COURT ADMINISTRATION SEES IT AS IMPORTANT THAT THEYRE PUTTING A NEW TEAM OF ATTORNEYS.
THATS RIGHT THIS WILL BE A NEW TEAM THAT WILL NOW HAVE TO PUSH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF ARGUMENTS TO TRY TO GET THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE 2020 CENSUS.
AND WEVE LEARNED THAT THE POLITICAL APPOINTEE WHO LED THE INITIAL TEAM OF LAWYERS DID IN FACT THINK THAT IT MADE SENSE TO GET A NEW TEAM OF LAWYERS ON BOARD BECAUSE THEYRE REALLY DOING AN ABOUTFACE HERE AND ITS A FLIPFLOP THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FORCED BY THE PRESIDENT.
REMEMBER IT WAS LESS THAN A WEEK AGO THAT THIS FIGHT SEEMED TO BE OVER.
LAWYERS FROM THE DOJS FEDERAL PROGRAMS BRANCH TOLD THE CHALLENGERS TO THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION THAT THE CENSUS WAS GOING TO PRINT WITHOUT THE CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION.
AND THEN THOSE LAWYERS TOLD A JUDGE THAT THE DIVISION WAS FINAL BUT THEN OF COURSE WE SAW THAT FLURRY OF TWEETS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND HE INSISTED THAT HE WOULD PUSH HIS ADMINISTRATION TO FIND A WAY TO ADD THIS QUESTION.
NOW DOJ LAWYERS ADMITTED JUST LAST WEEK TO A MARYLAND JUDGE IN A HEARING ON WEDNESDAY THAT THEY WERE REALLY BLINDSIDED BY THE PRESIDENTS TWEETS.
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DOJ HAS BEEN INSISTING ALL ALONG THAT A JULY 1st DEADLINE TO PRINT THE CENSUS WAS THE ABSOLUTE DROP DEAD DEADLINE.
AND NOW ALL INDICATIONS THAT THE DOJ IS CONTINUING TO PRESS FORWARD TO FIND A RATIONALE TO ADD THIS QUESTION.
THE SUPREME COURT SAID WHEN THEY MADE THE RULING THAT IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CENSUS BUREAU WENT BACK AND PROVIDED SOME SORT OF RATION THIS QUESTION COULD BE ADDED.
BUT REALLY IT SEEMS ADMINISTRATION IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
THEYVE ALREADY GONE PAST THEIR JULY 1st DEADLINE AND NOW THEY COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH IT FORWARD.
WHO KNOWS IF THEY WOULD SCENE HAVE TIME TO ADD IT.
AND TO YOUR POINT NOT TO MENTION IF THEY COME UP WITH A COMPLETELY NEW RATIONALE AND REASONING WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR WILBUR ROSS TESTIMONY WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE RATIONALE ET CETERA.
I GUESS IF THEY WIN ON THIS ARE THEY GOING TO PUT AN INSERT IN CENSUS FOR EVERYONE?
HOW WOULD THIS PLAY OUT?
LOGISTICALLY THATS SORT OF THE BIG QUESTION HERE.
THE CENSUS WE KNOW FROM DOJ OFFICIALS IT HAS GONE TO PRINT WITHOUT THAT QUESTION BUT COULD THE ADMINISTRATION SOMEHOW ADD ON A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION BY MAYBE ADDING SUPPLEMENTAL PAGES SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONNAIRES?
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS FLOATED THE IDEA EVEN OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MANDATE THAT THIS QUESTION BE ADDED.
BUT ALL OF THESE OPTIONS POPPY THEYRE SURE TO FACE THESE CONTINUED LEGAL FIGHTS.
WERE ALREADY SEEING IT ON TWO FRONT IN FEDERAL COURTS IN NEW YORK AND MARYLAND HERE.
AND OF COURSE WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME BECAUSE WERE LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AWAY FROM 2020 AND THE CENSUS NEEDS TO GET OUT.
JESSICA SCHNEIDER THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THIS MORNING DEMOCRATIC FRESHMAN CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA OCASCIOCORTEZ IS HITTING BACK AT SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI.
PELOSI CRITICIZED HER AND THREE OTHER DEMOCRATS FOR VOTING AGAINST THE MEASURE FOR BORDER FUNDING THAT EVENTUALLY PASSED FOR THOSE DETENTION FACILITIES.
PELOSI TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES IN AN INTERVIEW QUOTE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR PUBLIC WHATEVER AND THEIR TWITTER WORLD BUT THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY FOLLOWING.
THEYRE FOUR PEOPLE AND THATS HOW MANY VOTES THEY GOT.
SO OCASCIOCORTEZ TAKING TO WHAT ELSE TWITTER TO FIRE BACK CALLING PELOSIS DECISION TO QUOTE BLINDLY TRUST THE WHITE HOUSE QUOTE A BIG MISTAKE.
MOLLY BALL IS WITH ME NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TORE TIME.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
AND TIFFANY LET ME JUST BEGIN WITH YOU.
IDEAL LOGICALLY ON THIS THEY COULD NOT BE MORE DIVIDED.
I DO THINK ITS INTERESTING THAT NANCY PELOSI HAS ALSO SAID IN SORT OF THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS CRITICIZING THE MEDIA SAYING YOURE FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON DIVISION IN THE PARTY THAN ON THE ISSUE AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER.
WERE FOCUSING A LOT ON THE ISSUE AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER.
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS DIVIDE?
WELL I TAKE PELOSIS POINT THAT I DO THINK THERES THIS CONTINUAL DRIVE THAT DEMOCRATS .
LISTEN THIS IS AEALTHY GEAPPENING WITHIN THE PARTY AND QUITE FRANKLY IM NOT HERE TO BEAT UP ON NANCY PELOSI.
I HAT SHES ACHIEVED SOME CONGRESSIONAL FEATS IN HER TENURE.
BUT I DO THINK IN THIS INSTANCE THAT SHE DID LOOK A BIT O OF STEP WITH HER PARTY.
IF YOU REMEMBERHEIME WHEN SHE WAS GOING THROUGH CAMPAIGNING AND TRYING TO BE HOUSE SPEAKER AGAIN AND CONGRESSWOMAN PRESSLEY ONE OF THEHO DIDN THE BORDER FUNDING SAID IM GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU BUT I DID NOT ASK FOR YOUR PERMISSION TO LEAD.
THIS IS WHAT SHES REC ENG NOW.
THESE FOUR WOMEN ARE ON THEY ARE LAWMAKERS THAT ARE GOING TOOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE ANDEFLECT E VIEWS OF THEIR CONSTITUENCY.
THIS IS A MAJOR DEFEAT BECAUSE SHES USED TO BEING ABLE TO WHIP HER CAUCUS BUT AS THIS GENERATIONAL STEP HAPPENS YOURE GOING TO SEE DISCORD AND I DONT THINK THATS A BAD THING FOR THE PARTY.
ITS INTERESTING THE LINE THAT REALLY STRUCK US IN THE TIMES PIECE FROM PELOSI IF THE LEFT DOESNT THINK IM LEFT ENOUGH SO BE IT.
WILL THAT WORK FOR HER?
WILL SHE HAVE TO ANSWER MORE AND MORE CALLS FROM THE LEFT?
WELL WELL SEE.
I THINK THAT SHES GOING TO BE INCREASINGLY TESTED BY THESE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE CAUCUS.
WERE GOING TO SEE THIS WEEK AS THE DEBATE HEATS UP OVER PENTAGON FUNDING WHETHER SHE CAN KEEP THOSE LIBERAL MEMBERS IN THE TENT.
HER TACTIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO SORT OF USE THE LEFT TO TRY ANG YU LATE.
BECAUSE SHE IDENTIFIES AS A LIBERAL AND SHES FROM ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNT EVEN THOUGH SHE IS NOT NEARLY AS LIBERAL AS HER DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO.
SHE HAS ALWAYS SORT OF  ESPECIALLY SINCE REPUBLICANS HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PORTRAYING HER OF SAN FRANCISCO LIBERALISM SHE TAKES THAT AND SAYS THEY CALL ME A LIBERAL I GUESS I AM.
THAT MEANS THAT IM ON YOUR SIDE.
BUT THIS IS THE MOST WE CAN GET DONE PRACTICALLY.
I DONT THINK THIS IS OOEL AN IDEALOGICAL DIVISION SO MUCH AS A TACTICAL ONE.
AND WHAT SPEAKER PELOSI IS SAYING IS I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THESE IDEAS BUT ARE YOU WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM ARE YOU WORKING WITHIN THE PROCESS?
SO SHES SAYING YOU MAY HAVE SUPPORT OUT THERE ON TWITTER OR IN THE REAL WORD DO YOU HAVE SUPPORT IN THE CONFERENCE?
AND THATS WHAT WERE GOING TO SEE IS ARE THESE LIBERALS WILLING TO PLAY HARD BALL WITH THE LEADERSHIP?
ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE NANCY PELOSIS MORE DIFFICULT?
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS COMPLAINING NANCY DID GET HER VERSION THROUGH THE HOUSE AND SHE GOT THE SENATE BILL THROUGH THE HOUSE.
THATS TRUE.
REAL QUICKLY POPPY.
I HEAR YOU MOLLY AND I COMPLETELY AGREE.
I DO THINK THIS IS AN IDEALOGICAL AND A TACTICAL DIVISION WITHIN THESE WOMEN.
THEYRE ALL FOUR WOMEN OF COLOR WHO VOTED AGAINST THIS BILL.
AND THE REALITY I THINK THERES TROUBLE RECONCILING WITHIN THIS COUNTRY IF THESE WERE WHITE BABIES BEING TREATED THIS WAY IN THESE DETENTION FACILITIES IF THESE WERE WHITE WOMEN BEING HELD IN OVERCROWDED FACILITIES BEING TOLD TO DRINK FROM TOILETS THERE CERTAINLY WOULD BE MORE OF A NATIONAL OUTCRY.
AND I THINK THATS SO IMPORTANT AND RESONATING THEYRE SAYING WE CANNOT TRUST THIS ADMINISTRATION.
AND THERES BEEN CONTINUAL EVIDENCE OF DONALD TRUMP MISUSING FUNDS.
WE JUST SAW ON JULY 4th AS A CANDIDATE AND PRESIDENT HE HAS MISUSED FUNDS.
SO I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THESE WOMEN SAYING WHY WOULD WE BLINDLY TRUST THIS MAN?
WE JUST FOUND OUT TODAY THAT ICE IS USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY.
STATES HAVENT PASSED LAWS TO ALLOW THAT.
UNDOCUMENT IMMIGRANTS DIDNT KNOW THEY WERE TURNING THEIR INFORMATION OVER TO ICE.
YOURE REFERENCING THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTING SAYING THAT ICE HAS BEEN USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO SCAN PHOTOS OF THE DMV OF DRIVERS LICENSES EVEN OF PEOPLE NOT ACCUSED OF COMMITTING CRIMES AND THAT RAISES A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER QUESTIONS.
MOLLY I FOUND THIS ATTACK ACTUALLY ON NANCY PELOSI FROM WOMENS U.S. SO A SECRmSTRAIG BI A FIGHT FOR EQUAL i How do you gauge thei i greatness of an SUV?i i or to carry on a legacy?

With all that USAA offers why go with anybody else?

THIS JUST IN TO CNN NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO HAS JUST SIGNED A LAW THAT WILL ALLOW CONGRESS TO GET AHOLD OF PRESIDENT TRUMPS STATE TAX RETURNS.
OF COURSE THIS COMES AMID THE ESCALATING FIGHT WITH TOP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AND CONGRESS TRYING TO GET THE PRESIDENTS FEDERAL TAX RETURNS.
WELL SEE HOW THIS DEVELOPS.
WELL FANS CHANTED EQUAL PAY AS THE WOMENS NATIONAL TEAM RECEIVED THEIR WORLD CUP MEDDLES AFTER THEIR SECOND STRAIGHT WIN ON SAUN.
THE TEAM IS SUING THE U.S. SOCCER FEDERATION OVER THEIR PAY AND THEIR STAR ISG OUT SO MUCH CELEBRATETHERE ING. ANDY.
SUCH A WIN.
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THE BIGGER FIGHT FOR THEM IS AT HOME.
THAT COULD BE TRUE POPPY.
BUT IF THERES EVER A TEAM THAT THEN W THELK IT ISRTHE U.S. WO NATIONAL TEAM.
IT WNCREDIBL PERFORMANCE.
THEY HAD SO MUCH ON OFF ME.
FIELD T FIGHT FOR EQUAL BUT THIS TEAM IS STILL ABLE TO PUT IT ALL ASIDE AND PROVE THAT THEY ARE THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD.
TEAM USA BEATING THE NETHERLANDS 20 IN THE FINAL.
THEYRE ON THEIR BAY BACK TO THE U.S.
HERES A PRETTY COOL PICK THEY TOOK TOGETHER BEFORE BOARDING THEIR PLANE.
THEYRE GOING TO ARRIVE ABOUT 415 EAS GOING TO HAVADE TOMORROW IN NEW YORK.
RAPINOE WAS ASKED HOW THEIR DOMINANT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT THE FEDERATIONS DEFENSE AGAINST THEM IN THEIR LAWSUIT.
ITS NOT GOOD FOR THEM IS IT?
I MEAN I THINK OBVIOUSLY ITS HUGE.
I THINK WEVE BEEN A LITTLE SHY TO SAY THAT PUTTING SO MUCH PRESSURE ON OURSELVES BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE A CASE NO MATTER WHAT.
OBVIOUSLY WE BROUGHT THE LAWSUIT.
BUT THIS JUST SORT OF BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER.
ITS NOT ABOUT THAT ANYMORE ITS JUST KIND OF ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING.
I THINK THE FEDERATION IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO KIND OF RIDE THIS WAVE OF GOOD FORTUNE AND GET ON BOARD AND HOPEFULLY SET THINGS RIGHT FOR THE FUTURE.
THE PLAYERS IN THE U.S. SOCCER FEDERATION WILL HEAD TO MEDIATION SOMETIME SOON OVER PAY.
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE WOMENS TEAM HAS MADE MORE REVENUE THAN THE MEN.
THAT BEING SAID THE MEN DID MAKE THE WORLD CUP LAST YEAR AND THE DIFFERENCE IS STAGGERING.
THE MENS CUP MADE 6 BILLION AND PAID OUT 400 MILLION TO THE TEAMS.
THE WOMENS IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ONLY ABOUT 130 MILLION IN REVENUE PAYING OUT 30 MILLION TO THE TEAMS.
THERES NO QUESTION THE WOMENS TEAM IS MORE SUCCESSFUL.
THEY ALL KNOW THEIR NAMES AND THEY SELL FOR JERSEYS BUT NOW THERES SO MUCH MORE MONEY IN MENS SOCCER WERE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF THE FEDERATION DECIDES TO GIVE THEM A PAY RAISE.
BUT IN THE PAST THE FEDERATION HAS ARGUED THAT THE WOMENS AND MENS TEAMS ARE SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PERFORM SEPARATE AND THEY HAVE SEPARATE BUDGETS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENT REVENUE THAT THE TEAMS GENERATE.
YOU ALSO HAVEBE ABLE TSEE T PLACES.
THERE HAVE BEEN NETWORKS THAT HAVE PULLED THEIR GAMES.
BEFORE YOU GO LETS TALK ABOUT THE 15YEAROLD TENNIS PHENOM COCO GAUFF BACK IN ACTION PLAYING AT WIMBLEDON THIS MORNING.
JUST BIG PICTURE FOR SO MANY OF US THAT ARENT BIG TENNIS FANS THEY CAME OUT OF THE BLUE.
SHEY DID AND SHE IS A SUPERSTAR IN THE MAKING.
RIGHT NOW NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR HER WOIBD FUTURE.
SHE LOST THE FIRST SET TO HALEP.
SHE MADE A BIG COMEBACK ON FRIDAY.
COCO HAS REALLY BECOME A CROWD FAVORITE AT WIMBLEDON AFTER BEING THE YOUNGEST TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL ROUND IN 28 YEARS.
SHE DOESNT TURN 16 UNTIL MARCH.
JUST AN INCREDIBLE RUN.
I MEAN POPPY WHEN YOU WERE 15 COULD YOU IMAGINE DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
I KNOW I SURE COULDNT.
I DONT KNOW WHAT I WAS DOIN.
NOTHING CLOSEk THAT.
IS REMARKABLE.
ROOTING FOR HER.
ANDY THANK YOU.

SO IN JUST A FEW HOURS PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GIVE A SPEECH AS THE WHITE HOUSE PUTS IT QUOTE TO RECOGNIZE HIS ADMINISTRATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP AND AMERICAS LEADING ROLE IN THE WORLD.
BUT HIS SPEECH WOULD FOLLOW MAJOR STEPS IN MISS ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE OVER 80 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS PUT IN PLACE UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
LETS TALK ABOUT THE FACTS HERE.
OUR CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT IS WITH ME AND FORMER EPA DPIN STRART UNDER THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH.
SO WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS TODAY AND WELL GET TO SORT OF WHY THEYRE DOING THIS IN A MOMENT.
LET ME JUST OUTLINE FOR EVERYONE WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATIONS OWN EPA SAID IN A REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN APRIL.
HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS HURRICANE STORM INTENSITY FREQUENCY AND DURATION WILL INCREASE MORE INTENSE DROUGHTS WARMER TEMPERATURES CAUSING MORE WILD FIRES AND THIS IS THE PRESIDENTS OWN EPA WARNED TO ANTICIPATE A COMBINATION OF IMPACTS FLOODS AND FIRES WHICH MAY BE INTENSIFIED BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING CLIMATE.
FROM WHAT YOUVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE NOT THE RHETORIC IS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY ENOUGH AT ALL?
NO NOT AT ALL.
AND THEYRE ROLLING BACK REGULATIONS IN A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER AREAS THAT ARE MAKING PEOPLES LIVES LESS HEALTHY.
THEYRE A THREAT SO US IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.
THE CLIMATE CRISI IS ONE OF.
PRETENDING IT DOESNT EXIST DOESNT STOP IT DOESNT MAKE IT GO AWAY.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.
SOME OF WHATS BEEN ROLLED BACK BILL INCLUDES OBVIOUSLY PULLING OUT OF THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT LOWERING THE CAR EMISSION STANDARDS THAT HAD BEEN INCREASED TO STOP SO MUCH POLLUTION WEAKENING THE CLEAN POWER PLAN FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ELIMINATING THE EPA PANEL ON POLLUTION AND OPENING UP ANWAR WHICH YOUVE DONE A LOT OF REPORTING ON.
YES.
THE PRESIDENT IS OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD TASTE THE AIR IN LOS ANGELES AND WHEN THE CUYAHOGA RIVER IN OHIO WAS ON FIRE.
AND TODAY YOU CAN SWIM THE CUYAHOGA.
ITS BEAUTIFUL.
AND YOU CAN GO TO LA AND SEE THE MOUNTAINS.
THAT DIDNT HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT.
IT HAPPENED WHEN NIXON SIGNED THE CLEAR AIR AND WATER ACT AND THEN 40 YEARS OF DELIBERATE LAW MAKING TO GRIND THIS THING OUT WHY YOU CAN SAY THE AIR IS CLEAR.
NEW ZEALAND BLOWS US AWAY.
BUT WHATS LOST IN THIS CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER TODAY MESSAGING IS THAT HE SHOULD BE SAYING  STEP TO THE MICROPHONE AND SAY WHEN BARON IS MY AGE LIFE AS WE KNOW IT WILL BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
BECAUSE IT ISBOUT OUR CHILDREN.
IT IS.
ITS ABOUT THE FUTURE.
AND HE HAS A YOUNG CHILD AS YOU BRING UP.
SO LISTEN TO OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT HAS TOUTED THIS AND TALKED ABOUT AMERICAS AIR AND WATER AS BEING AT A RECORD CLEAN HIS WORDS.
AND THEN THE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON WITH JAKE TAPPER JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO MADE THIS ARGUE.
LISTEN.
AMERICA HAS THE CLEANEST AIR AND WATER IN THE WORLD.
WELL CONTINUE TO USE  THATS NOT TRUE.
WE DONT HAVE THE CLEANEST AIRE.
WE DONT.
YOU GET BACK TO ME WITH SOME STATISTICS.
WERE MAKING PROGRESS ON REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS.
I MEAN JAKE LAUGHED BECAUSE IT IS LAUGHABLE BECAUSE ITS JUST NOT TRUE.
SO WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS AHEAD OF THE SPEECH WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING OUT JUST BLATANT UNTRUTHS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT?
MY KWERN IS THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO TAKE WHAT HE SAYS AND SAY HE MAY NOT BE TELLING THE WHOLE TRUTH BUT WE DONT CARE.
THIS IS THE MOMENT WITH WE REALLY NEED TO CARE ABOUT THIS.
IT IS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN.
ITS ABOUT THE FUTURE AND MAKING OUR LIVES HEALTHIER MAKING OUR ECONOMY GREATER WHICH WE CAN DO AND WEVE DONE IT OVER TIME AS YOU POINTED OUT WHEN WE STARTED THE EPA WITH A CLEAN AIR ACT AND CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER WE SAW THE POPULATION GROW WE SAW THE REAL GPP MORE THAN DOUBLE WE SAW OUR ENERGY USE CLIMB.
AND YET WE WERE ABLE TO GROW OUR ECONOMY AT EXTRAORDINARY RATES.
SO ITS NOT AN EITHEROR THING AND WE HAVE GOT TO GET OVER THIS IDEA THAT IT IS AND SOMEHOW DOING AWAY WITH REGULATIONS IS GOING TO MAKE EVERYTHING HAPPY.
BILL YOUVE DONE SO MUCH REPORTING ON THIS.
IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE THE CASE THAT PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT HURTS BUSINESS.
IT MEANS YOU TRANSFORM BUSINESS?
ABSOLUTELY.
AS THE GOVERNOR POINTS OUT WE DIDNT GO INTO A 40YEAR RECESSION WHEN WE STARTED WORRYING ABOUT BREATHABLE AIR.
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT YOU KNOW THE BIG PICTURE STORY THAT WERE JUST NOT WIRED AS HUMAN BEINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.
WE DONT THINK INE EARTH LONG TIME FRAMES.
WE THINK IF THAT NOISE BEHIND THAT ROCK IS GOING TO EAT ME.
BUT IF YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT EVERY 2.7 SECONDS A PIECE OF THE ARCTIC ICE TURNS TO WATER AND ITS BEENT WAY FOR 40 YEARS.
SO AGAIN BARON TRUMP WILL NOT GET A 30YEAR MORTGAGE IN MIAMI BECAUSE IT WILL CHANGE THE TOPOGRAPHY OF OUR LAND.
THE ADMINISTRATION WE HEAR BILL A LOT TALK ABOUT NATURAL GAS AND THE PUSH FOR NATURAL GAS AND REPLACING COAL PARTS OF COAL WITH THAT AND HOW THAT YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY SOLVES THINGS.
IT HAPPENS RIGHT?
BUT IT DOESNT AT ALL ADDRESS THE BIG ISSUE DOES IT?
EVERYTHING IS CLEANER THAN COAL.
WE COULD BURN WHALES AGAIN AND IT WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER COAL BUT ITS STILL EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM.
SOLAR AND WIND HAS INCREASED AND GOTTEN CHEAPER IT HASNT REPLACED FOS ILL FUELS.
WERE BURNING EVERYTHING.
NUCLEAR MIGHT BE SHOULD BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION.
I THINK A TRANSITION THAT NAUK CLEAR IS WHAT WEVE GOT TO LOOK AT BECAUSE WEVE GOT THESE NUCLEAR REACTORS THAT PRODUCE NO REGULATED POLLUTANTS OR GREENHOUSE GASES WHILE THEYRE PRODUCING POWER.
AND WE SEEM TO BE CLOSING THEM DOWN WHICH I THINK IS A PROBLEM.
WERE NOT GOING TO BUILD ANY MORE BIG ONES BUT SMALL MODULAR WE COULD CREATE JOBS THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY.
THATS THE NEW WAVE UNTIL THE RENEWABLES GET TO BE BASED POWER NOT JUST SHAVINGS THAT ARE ON 247.
THEN WE CAN GO WITH THAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELL BE WATCHING AGAIN.
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO GIVE THIS ADDRESS IN JUST A FEW YOU SHOULD WATCH IT OR READ THE ENTIRE THING.
RIGHT THIS.
